This is [the article](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/) that started me down the road to thinking about [ditching wordpress](http://ramseeker.com/2016/switched-to-jekyll-from-wordpress/) and using [Jekyll](http://www.jekyllrb.com) as my new blogging tool of choice. 

This is time well spent learning how to do this, as you get a free website hosting and plain text sites are much faster than a wordpress site too. 

> Jekyll takes your content written in Markdown, passes it through your templates and spits it out as a complete static website, ready to be served. GitHub Pages conveniently serves the website directly from your GitHub repository so that you donâ€™t have to deal with any hosting.
