I got asked this today, so thought I would share my answer here as I feel that RAM for your computer  is the best upgrade you can do for both your Mac or  PC and with RAM prices being so cheap right now,  a hundred  bucks goes pretty far, and if you can afford to double that hundred dollars to two hundred dollars you&#8217;ll find you may be able to buy not only enough RAM to fill your notebook or desktop, but if you can live with a smaller sized boot drive you can also upgrade to a SSD for even more savings.

&nbsp;

**$100 worth of RAM **

You could easily fill any 2011 notebook with enough RAM for the hundred  bucks, and unless you are in the need for 16GB of RAM in a notebook with only 2 memory upgrade slots, 8GB of RAM is more cost efficient and with rebate, costs close to a third of that cost overall.

Corsair  notebook RAM is  the cheapest 8GB RAM I could find  and with a rebate until the end of the month that drops the price down to $37, you&#8217;re not even anywhere near your hundred dollar budget and for most notebooks, the 8GB RAM Upgrade is more than enough and you&#8217;ll still increase the  performance of your notebook for much less than the hundred dollars you have set aside.

**[Buy 8GB Memory ON Sale for under $100. ][1]**

**$100 worth of hard drive. **

**[Cheapest SSD Drive][2]**

There&#8217;s even more choice when it comes to buying a new hard drive to replace the stock and ever shrinking stock hard drive that came with your computer. You can buy a big conventional hard drive if you care more about  storage space than speed, or if a faster hard drive i  what you&#8217;re after replace the drive you have with a much faster (but smaller) SSD drive. 60GB SSD&#8217;s are under $100 and 128BB SSD&#8217;s are dropping in price too if you can wait a bit longer before you upgrade to a solid state drive.

Another option is the Seagate Momentus XP that offers the best of both worlds: 4gb of SSD storage for your operating system and othet  commonly used files and 500GB of storage space so you&#8217;re not limited to drive space. This is especially important for notebook computer users who want to carry all their files with them for easy access at any time.

[**Momentus XP by Seagate**][3]

&nbsp;

$100 gets you far more memory and  hard drive space than even when compared to a year ago and with ram prices so low it&#8217;s never been a better time for a ram upgrade.

**[Buy  RAM (or anything else) from Amazon  for what I have found to be the best prices online overall. ][1]**
