When shopping for a Mac Mini in 2015, one of the things you do not have to worry about are ram upgrades you can do your self because on the 2014 Mac Mini models you cannot upgrade the ram on your Mac Mini yourself. This means if you are looking to buy an Apple Mac Mini of the 2014 model you better be sure you buy the model with enough RAM for your needs, and for this year that means you can buy a new Mac Mini with 4GB, 8GB or 16GB maximum ram that’s soldered on the motherboard and that means you can’t upgrade the ram yourself.

**The 4GB Mac Mini**

The 4GB Mac Mini for 2014 is the cheapest Mac Mini you can buy this year but it also has the lowest when it comes to ram maximums and this relatively minor amount of RAM might mean you might want to consider adding more RAM to the Mac Mini via the Apple Store at the time of purchase. But then your cheap Mac Mini that was under $500 is now much more expensive and you might be better off buying:

**The 8GB Mac Mini**

The 8GB Model is priced under $700 and not only do you get more RAM for the price you also get some other features like a faster processor, and larger hard drive. If you need even more RAM for your Mac Mini (in most cases, 8Gb would be enough for everyday use) then you might consider adding more RAM to the 8GB model to max out the Mac Mini to 16GB, or you could buy:

**The 16GB Mac Mini**

Where to Buy RAM for 2012 and Later Mac Mini

If you have an older Mac Mini or are considering buying one due to the fact that these later models allow you to swap out the RAM and hard drives yourself easily (the hard drive upgrade on the Mac Mini can take a bit of work) then you’re best off buying the Mac Mini RAM yourself and upgrading the RAM on your own to both speed up your Mac and get greater longevity from it too. It’s not uncommon to have ten year old Mac Mini models still in use, and I wonder if this will be the case on the most recent models?

The Mac Mini RAM you need to buy depends on year and model or even part number so you’re best to refer to a [memory compatability chart][1] or if you prefer, I have a page dedicated to helping you find the [right RAM for your Mac Mini][2] and once you know the type of RAM you need for the Mac Mini then all you need to do is to check the ram prices on Mac Mini RAM for your compatible model. Most recent Mac Mini models like the 2011 and 2012 models use [DDR3 1600Mhz memory][3] and the prices for RAM for these are reasonable and can be found at the following stores that sell memory for Mac Mini models:

[Amazon][4]  
[Data Memory Systems][5]  
[OWC][6]  
[RAMJET][7]  
[Memory X][8]  
[OEMPCWORLD][9]

## The Best RAM for Apple Mac Mini {#the-best-ram-for-apple-mac-mini}

Regardless of what store you buy Mac Mini RAM from you need to buy memory from a reputable manufacturer like Kingston Memory or Crucial Memory and you need to be sure it is compatible for your Mac Mini Model. Again, if you have a current 2012-2011 Mac Mini the ram you need to buy is here:

This is a reputable brand name (Crucial) and is a pretty good price for 16GB of RAM for the Mac Mini right now. If you need to buy less than 16GB of RAM then the 8GB RAM for Mac Mini is currently priced at under $100 and is a great way to upgrade the older Mac Mini models which tended to ship with as little as 2GB of RAM so an 8GB RAM upgrade will quadruple the memory in these models:
