Cheap RAM has to be one of the biggest ways people find ramseeker. They type &#8216;cheap ram, or cheapest ram, or where can I buy cheap ram and  search engines supply you with an answer: and here you are <img src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

I know, you&#8217;re thinking that there&#8217;s lots of stores that advertise the cheapest RAM and at times they do offer the best price on ram (this is assuming you mean best price being equal to lowest price) but I&#8217;ve found that for the most part the low price leaders for memory either do one of two things after a while:

1. The cheapest ram dealers go out of business. I&#8217;ve seen it at least a few times. These new vendors come on the market and state total domination but then they realize that they&#8217;ve pretty much priced themselves out of the market.

2. They give up trying to be the lowest price on ram upgrades because sometimes with that also comes the joys of the internet and sometimes the cost of a sale frankly,isn&#8217;t worth the effort as margins are cut so low it&#8217;s hard to make any money on RAM if you have to answer a million pre-sale and post sale support questions. Sometimes these low price memory stores realize that after a while, it&#8217;s best to be priced higher up. Less sales,  perhaps but also less grief and support costs too.

Lastly there&#8217;s one more reason why you should make ramseeker your number 1 destination when shopping for memory upgrades. I get special discounts for you that you only can get by shopping through the ramseeker system.  These memory stores can offer a better deal to ramseeker readers because they know they will be rewarded with better sales which makes up for any profit margins they might lose had they not offered the ramseeker memory discount.

With ramseeker you get the best deal on ram upgrades from Memory stores you can trust year after year after year  to help you find the **[cheapest ram][2]** upgrades for your PC or Mac and the support that you want and expect too.
