OMG Chrome notes that doday is the day of the latest release of Ubuntu 16.04

I have been trying Ubuntu as a **much cheaper** alternative to Mac OS. It's not as polished in some areas and some of the software is a bit lacking, but for my needs - mostly writing and blogging, I have to say it's been a success so far. 

Hit the link for the download info, and what's new in Ubuntu's latest version:
