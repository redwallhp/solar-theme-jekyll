Like some older Macs like the [Performa](http://ramseeker.com/apple-performa-and-older-mac-memory-upgrades) , these are pretty old computers in 2016 and have long been discontinued. But, if you have one either for collecting or even as a daily driver adding more RAM is always a good idea. 

These computers take either [30-pin ](http://amzn.to/2abvNvU)or [72-pin SIMMS ](http://amzn.to/2aosi0l)depending on specific model.
