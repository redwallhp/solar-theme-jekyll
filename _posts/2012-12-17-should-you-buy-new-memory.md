The answer, is yes.

The answer also is : **Max out the memory on your computer with new memory.** You&#8217;ll get the best performance boost that** offers more bang for dollar spent **than any other upgrade you could make on your computer. Most new software (excepting freeware, shareware, or um, borrowed software) costs way more than a **new memory upgrade** would cost, yet the **new ram upgrade offers performance enahancements** that are usually unprecedented  and will also allow you to use your** new ram to speed up your computer**. Once you&#8217;ve **added memory to your desktop or notebook computer **you will find that the new fancy software that you bought will run faster than before you added the memory.

**Used Memory**, I suppose ten years ago wasn&#8217;t as bad an idea as** memory prices for both desktop and notebook computers were much much higher** on average. Now you can get a new notebook and ** fill it with memory** for under $500 in most cases and the** performance adavantages will be higher than what used memory could be**. Unless you&#8217;re a hobbyist, and are tinkering with a project where even new memory is too much money to spend, than you can search ebay/craigslist, etc for used memory.** But it&#8217;s my opinion that new memory is really the only way to go **unless you&#8217;re really on a tight budget and can spend the time and make the effort for used memory. But even then, the used memory doesn&#8217;t come with any support usually.

For me, it&#8217;s **new memory or not at all**.

For new computers, Apple or PC. and except for the odd few configurations (8gb for the iMacs seems to be a little on the high prices, but prices are dropping) I suggest maxing out your new computer purchase right at the beginning when the computer is still new and offers the best return on your money, that&#8217;s the time you want add new memory to your Mac or PC I would think.

I&#8217;m writing this on a year-old plus MacBook Pro and I upgraded the memory and replaced the factory ram with new memory at a total cost of $100 to fill my Macbook with new ram. Over the year, this works out to a cost of  .27 cents per day for my new memory.

Some might argue that I&#8217;m biased as I track and monitor the new memory prices but it&#8217;s really hard to argue with an upgrade that costs on average  less than a quarter per day.
