#### Today I saw a Frog. This is my Blog. 

I guess this is a good a start as any to my new blog here. I just need a place to store my stuff like photos, links and articles I'm interested in and here I am blogging away at this domain name. 

Technically this is not my **Hello World **post, as [this post is](http://hyperlinked.co/2016/08/02/DDR2-Memory/), but that post was really just a test post more than anything so for now I will assume this is my very first post.

So with that out of the way hello world. Here's a photo of a frog I took today when out picking fresh raspberries which Iater made fresh raspberry pancakes with which were delicious 

It was a pretty good day off from work today with fresh fruit and nature.
