The new MacBook Pros from Apple come standard with  4GB installed as default.  Some of the older MacBooks can also accept a maximum of 4GB and until just recently &#8211; as in a month ago &#8211; 4GB was the maximum in most MacBook Pros on sale by Apple.

**[8GB MacBook Pro RAM under $100][1]**

To answer your question? It depends.

[table id=15 /]

I know it sounds kind of vague so let me explain: I&#8217;ve got a text document open and so it takes some RAM to run Mac OS and  a wee bit more to launch and keep open the application  (and a few other application  I have open like Mail and Safari ).

And then my Mac waits. for me. Even if I could fill my MacBook Pro with 64GB of RAM my mac&#8217;s still going to be waiting for me to type another letter or character. I type about 40 words per minute and let me tell you the speed of the RAM is much faster than that.

But let&#8217;s say I then go out and record a full HD movie at the biggest full high definition resolution and download that video to my computer so I can share with my friends the great time I had at the beach or dinner or whatever..I made a movie and I want to share it.

But first I want to edit the movie and take out the part where I dropped the camera in the sand and then there was the part in the movie where I was just loading the car so I don&#8217;t want my friends to see all the junk I have in my trunk. I also want to make some cool little  titles  and fades and other stuff in iMovie so  at the end of the movie my friends say &#8220;wow that&#8217;s a great movie&#8221;.  To do all that is going to take a whole lot more ram than the stock ram configuration that comes with the MacBook Pro. And even if I could do all my movie editing with the current ram &#8211; more ram can&#8217;t hurt. Moving those pixels around whether it&#8217;s still or video takes a whole  lot more processing power and memory than the stock configuration of MacBook Pro.

Also there&#8217;s the saying, and I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve heard it: You can never have enough ram or hard drive space. I&#8217;ve never regretted buying RAM. Even if it&#8217;s been too much at the time of purchase. RAM is cheap. You can fill  up your MacBook Pro for about $200 and this  is much cheaper than some software like Photoshop or Lightroom even.

[4GB for the MacBook Pros ][2]will do just fine for facebook, email and light computing such as word processing. When you get into the processor intensive stuff like photo editing or movie editing  &#8211; buy all the RAM you can afford.
