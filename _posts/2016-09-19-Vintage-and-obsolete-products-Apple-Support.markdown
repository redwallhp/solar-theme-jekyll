I'm using an Obsolete Mac to write this. Still, this an interesting document to see what's considered old news by Apple. 

> Owners of iPhone, iPad, iPod, or Mac products may obtain service and parts from Apple or Apple service providers for 5 years after the product is no longer manufacturedâ€”or longer where required by law. Apple has discontinued support for certain technologically obsolete and vintage products.
