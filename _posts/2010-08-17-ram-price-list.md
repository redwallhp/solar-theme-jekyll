Maybe you&#8217;re in the market for ram and memory, or maybe you want to buy a dogde ram truck (you have the wrong site if that&#8217;s you need). Let&#8217;s stick to ram and memory, shall we? It&#8217;s tricky to shop for ram . One memory store I came across had five different ways you could shop for ram:  
When you have a ram price list in front of you you&#8217;ll be able to see at a quick glance what the best ram price for your needs will be.When you&#8217;re in the market for memory, whether you&#8217;re looking to compare prices on ram upgrades or you just want to buy some ram or memory from a store you can trust you&#8217;re usually wanting to refer to one thing and that&#8217;s a ram price list of some sort.

shop by ram type

shop by ram brand

shop by computer manufacturer

download software and it will tell you what ram you need.

shop by memory configurator &#8211; you use the pull-down menus and select your computer manufacturer, and model name of your computer and the memory configuration tool tells you what ram you need and usually returns a ram price list of all the ram available for your desktop or notebook computer from Apple, Dell, HP and so on..

**[Cheap RAM][1]**

The ram memory configurator is the most popular to use when shopping for ram, whether it&#8217;s for your PC or Mac. Some memory stores really promote this tool (crucial comes to mind), while other stores prefer you to know what type of RAM you need.

When RAM shopping, if it gets too complicated you can always email me and I&#8217;ll do my best to help or I&#8217;ve made few price lists for ram over the years that will help you get the best deal on ram upgrades. And by best deal, I don&#8217;t mean lowest price.  
Some other memory price trackers (even google does this) emphasizes low prices as the best price but with RAM this isn&#8217;t the case a lot of the times. Some of the lowest price memory stores I used to track have gone out of business over the years, while the higher priced but still competitive memory stores are still in business after all these years.

These are the memory stores I track and monitor &#8211; the memory stores that are reputable and offer a fair price on ram. Every ram store at very least uses the memory configurator as it&#8217;s the easiest method to shop for ram. All you have to do is enter your make and model of computer and back comes a specialized [ram price list][2] with the best memory prices available for your specific computer.
