<img class="alignnone" title="best usb dac for 2012" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/JIM_5414.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" />

One way to get better sound out of your computer or iPod  is to use an external DAC. A DAC, (digital audio converter) does what the description says it does: It translates digital audio to analog sound that is then amplified to your headphones (or loudspeakers) . In all but a few cases, the DAC inside your computer is not the best way to convert the digital signal from your audio files, regardless of whether they are in FLAC format, MP3 or Apple Lossless format the DAC inside your notebook or desktop computer is not going to be the best quality.

If you can now easily buy a brand new laptop for under $400, it only makes sense that the DAC isn&#8217;t going to be the best of quality. Then you also have to consider the noise inside the notebook computer from spinning hard drives (this is not really an issue with solid state drives thanks to the lack of moving parts on solid state drives), and all these factors add up to the fact that you&#8217;re not going get the best sound out of the headphone jack on your iPOd or notebook computer.

The solution to this is buy an external DAC for your notebook. You can spend silly money on a DAC  if you want, but one of the best DACs I have found (and am listening to right now as I write this) is the Fiio E7 portable headphone DAC. ([see my review here][1]). This small DAC is about the size of a small deck of cards and yet features a much better quality chip inside of the small and battery powered DAC.

Using the Fiio E7 with an iPod is easy (buy the iPod adapter cable) and then connect the Fiio E7 to the connector on the bottom of your iPod and then plug your headphones into the DAC

If you want to connect the DAC to your computer, all you need is a USB cable that comes with the Fiio E7 and connect the DAC to the USB output (you&#8217;re going to have to configure your computer to output through the USB port) and then connect your headphones.

For the money,  (well under $100) this has to be one of the  best values in a small and portable DAC that is very flexible and can be used as a portable self powered DAC for your iPod,  a notebook computer DAC or if you buy an external amplifier, can also be used as a DAC for your desktop computer to. You really can&#8217;t find a more versatile DAC for listening to your digital files and getting much better sound quality in 2012.

[**Buy the Fiio E7 ON SALE NOW at Amazon**][2]
