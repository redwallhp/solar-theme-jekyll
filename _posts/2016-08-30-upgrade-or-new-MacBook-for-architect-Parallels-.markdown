A pretty good discussion on getting more value out of an older MacBook Pro

[upgrade or new MacBook (for architect, Parallels)?](https://www.macintouch.com/forums/showthread.php?tid=566&pid=3984#pid3984)


Personally, I would go for the SSD and ram upgrade. I don't need much storage space thanks to the cloud and could easily get by with a 129GB SSD and 4GB of RAM. 

In fact, I've done this. I have a 2008 iMac that runs perfectly with these upgrades. 

New Macs are expensive.
