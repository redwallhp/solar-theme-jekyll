I think this will do me for a while. 

As a hobby, I sell stuff on [eBay](http://www.ebay.com/) and I like to pack it well so that I don't have to worry about it getting broken. So, I found 350 feet of bubble wrap for under $20.00 which I think is a pretty good deal. 

It sucks to have to spend money before you sell an item but when you buy bubble wrap in bulk like this then  it works out to pennies an item you sell.
