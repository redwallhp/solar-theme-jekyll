**[Save on the Dell Inspiron 15R Notebook][1]  
**

This particular notebook computer from Dell is the **[best selling notebook computer][2]** from Dell and available in quite a few different configurations if you buy from Dell directly, but my advice is to buy the **[cheapest Dell 15R][1]** you can find and upgrade the RAM and even the hard drive yourself rather than buying memory direct from the manufacturer, which is going to be more expensive than buying high quality memory and installing it yourself.

The Dell 15R from dell is available in two memory configurations:

Dell Inspiron 15R with 4GB Single Channel DDR3 SDRAM at 1333MHz  
Dell Inspiron 15R with 6GB Single Channel DDR3 SDRAM at 1333MHz

The best deal on a 15R from Dell is to buy the 4GB version and apply the money saved by not **[adding an 8GB Memory Upgrade Kit][3]**, which is the maximum memory for the Dell Inspiron 15R.

Be sure you buy right memory for the Dell Inspiron 15R, as this notebook requires the use of DDR3 1333Mhz sodimms. To replace the ram on your Dell, there are two memory upgrade slots available in this popular dell notebook and assuming you want to max out the Dell notebook to a full 8GB you would remove the factory installed RAM (either 1x2Gb and 1x4GB or 2X2GB, depending on original configuration and replace it with an [8GB Dell Inspiron 15R Memory Upgrade Kit][3] consisting of 2x4GB ddr3 1333Mhz memory modules.

**Where To Buy Dell Inspiron 15R Memory Upgrades.  
**

At the time of writing this the cheapest Dell Inspiron 15R memory upgrades are available ****[on sale at Amazon][4]**** and better any of the prices you see below. This may change over time so it&#8217;s best to check for yourself to see if any Dell ram prices have changed. More Memory Upgrade Options for the Dell Inspiron 15R are below:

**How to Install Dell Inspiron 15R Memory Upgrades  
**
