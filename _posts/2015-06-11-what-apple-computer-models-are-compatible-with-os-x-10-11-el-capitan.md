When Apple releases  a new software upgrade like they have with OS X 10.11 El Capitan one of the first questions that comes to mind is: **Is my Mac Compatible? **

Apple hasn&#8217;t specifically released compatibility charts with the El Capitan release because at this point it&#8217;s just beta software so changes could be made but for now it looks like the ansers is that  if your Mac can run [Yosemite][1] , then there&#8217;s a really good chance you can run the newer beta operating system too, and currently that means that  the following computers will work with OSX 10.11 according to [this page][2]<section class="section"> 

<p class="para">
  The OS X v10.11 Developer Beta supports the following Macs:
</p>

<ul class="list-bullet">
  <li class="item">
    <p class="para">
      iMac (Mid 2007 or newer)
    </p>
  </li>
  
  <li class="item">
    <p class="para">
      MacBook Air (Late 2008 or newer)
    </p>
  </li>
  
  <li class="item">
    <p class="para">
      MacBook (Late 2008 Aluminum, or Early 2009 or newer)
    </p>
  </li>
  
  <li class="item">
    <p class="para">
      Mac mini (Early 2009 or newer)
    </p>
  </li>
  
  <li class="item">
    <p class="para">
      MacBook Pro (Mid/Late 2007 or newer)
    </p>
  </li>
  
  <li class="item">
    <p class="para">
      Mac Pro (Early 2008 or newer)
    </p>
  </li>
  
  <li class="item">
    <p class="para">
      Xserve (Early 2009)
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

This is good news indeed for those of us that have older Macs and want to keep them running for as long as possible.</section> 

Granted, not ALL features will work on the older Macs: For example features like continuity and handoff might not be compatible with your hardware. But, if you&#8217;re like me and have an older Mac and  don&#8217;t really need **all the features  of the Mac OS **but you still want to try the new beta Mac OS X when it&#8217;s released in July then this is pretty great news. I thought for sure my 2008 Aluminum MacBook would be put out to pasture as it would not  be compatible with this latest release but it looks like I can still use my older Mac  with the Latest Mac OS which is pretty amazing for a 7 year old computer to be able to do.

I&#8217;m looking forward to giving the new beta a try when it&#8217;s released later in July 2015.
