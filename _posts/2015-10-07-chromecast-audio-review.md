Dan Moren at Six Colors [reviews the new Google Chromecast Audio][1]:

> The Chromecast Audio is an interesting product, but after I spent about an hour or so playing around with it, I realized that I don’t really have much of a need for it. But that doesn’t mean it’s a bad product, necessarily, just that my setup doesn’t really lend itself to this device. 

I have been interested in this device to replace my bluetooth wireles transmitter device and this is one of the first reviews I have seen.
