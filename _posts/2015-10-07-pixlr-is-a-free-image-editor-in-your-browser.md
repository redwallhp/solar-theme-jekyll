Sick of paying for Photoshop just to tweak a few photos here and there?  [Pixlr Editor][1] is  a **free image editor **that  I think is the best of the bunch. It&#8217;s got all the stuff I need like curves, levels, layers and more. As I rely on using my mobile devices for editing photos more and more, this image editing program is great for the few times you need bit more.
