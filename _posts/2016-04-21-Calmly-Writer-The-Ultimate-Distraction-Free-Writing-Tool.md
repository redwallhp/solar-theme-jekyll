I have used Calmly writer many times as my writing tool of choice. It'a a great way to write distraction free. It also syncs with Google drive so you can start writing on one computer and fire up another and pick up from where you left off. 

It also exports to markdown which is what I need now that I switched to Jekyll for my blog. 

Give it a try:

> Calmly Writer has been designed to help you focus on writing. As you start typing, all the distracting options disappear from the interface.
> 
> Calmly also includes "focus mode" option, which highlights only the paragraph you are editing at the time.
