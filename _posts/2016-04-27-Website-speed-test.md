Pingdom Tools is the first page I visit to test the speed of my site. With the new design and the fact that my site is now static and not on wordpress any longer, I have page load speeds down to less than a second, compared to the few seconds it was taking for the wordpress install.

> We built this Website Speed Test to help you analyze the load speed of your websites and learn how to make them faster. It lets you identify what about a web page is fast, slow, too big, what best practices youâ€™re not following, and so on. We have tried to make it useful both to experts and novices alike.
> 
> In short, we wanted it to be a easy-to-use tool to help webmasters and web developers everywhere optimize the performance of their websites.
