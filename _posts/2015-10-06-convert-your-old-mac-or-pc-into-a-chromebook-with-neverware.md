I&#8217;m not sure why you would want to do this but there&#8217;s software that  will allow to turn certain older Macs (and PC&#8217;s) into Chromebooks. [Neverware][1] is **free for individuals** or you can pay a monthly fee for eductators with more support.

> CloudReady only runs one thing: a browser. This makes for a bloat-proof and lightweight OS that can keep machines up to 8 years old fast and responsive.

> You don’t need to get a new machine to experience a market-leading OS or get reliable performance. CloudReady works on the computers you already have and lets cloud-services do the heavy lifting.

Not all Macs or PCs are supported, but a good number are.  One thing I did notice  is all the Macs they support will still run OSX El Capitan which gives you **a lot more features **than Chrome OS does but I&#8217;m going to guess this OS runs much faster on your old Mac. Check out all models neverware will run on [here][2]
