I have mentioned before I am \*this close\* to moving to the USA and one of the things that the USA offers over Canada is choice. I can choose  my internet provider, home  phone service, even email web host to be three different companies offering services, or.. you can buy all three online services from one provider and in my case that would be from Verizon as I already have Verizon wireless service from them and might as well pay one bill for all three and probably save some money in the process.

## Introducing VerizonCentral

Verizon Central is a website that&#8217;s a front door or portal or everyday start page for your browser which allows you not  only quick and easy login to your verizon wireless account, but a slew of other features including news, weather and other fun stuff too:

**Most Popular News**

This is pretty self explanatory. The biggest news of the day is displayed here, and constantly updates.

**More News**

In addition to the headline news, there&#8217;s more news in not only the news, but also in Entertainment, Sports, Today&#8217;s Deal of the Day, and the trending today chart offers what&#8217;s hot when you search using Verizon Central. Local News is  also offered so not only do you get to read international  and national news, you&#8217;ll be up to date in your community thanks to Verizon Central.

**Watch TV Online. **

This might be the biggest advantage to Verizon Central &#8211; the ability to watch TV right from your computer.

**Today in History **

This section allows you to look back at what was happening not only a year ago today, but also for other dates in history  that share the same date as today.

**Verizon Sign In**

Maybe I should have put this right at the top, but this might be the main reason you visit Verizon Central &#8211; to login to your Verizon Account, and  the Verizon web portal allows you to do just that with ease. Of course, you can also register for a Verizon Central Account if you don&#8217;t have one yet too.

**Local Weather Forecasts **keep you up to date on not only the latest weather conditions in your area, but also what&#8217;s in store for the weather in the upcoming days.

The Verizon Central Web Portal is a very good way to start your day and keeps you up to date and entertained as well with all the news and topics important  to you.

**VerizonEmail **When you sign up for Verizon cable services, you get a free and easy to remember email address for your personal email. In my case, my verizon email adresss might be ramseeker@verizon.net which is pretty easy to remember when you think about it compared to some of the domain extensions from other internet service providers.
