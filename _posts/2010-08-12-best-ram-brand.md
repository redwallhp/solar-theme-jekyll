That&#8217;s a question I get asked a lot &#8211; probably second after &#8216;what is the best memory, or what is the cheapest memory. And ramseeker isn&#8217;t the easiest to navigate sometimes if you don&#8217;t know what type of memory you have I also get asked what ram do I need for my computer? (BTW,  if you need help with your memory upgrades feel free to email me. I&#8217;m here to help you with your ram upgrades)

Back to the best RAM brand. There&#8217;s two ways you can buy ram: one that will save you the most money or for a little more money you can buy brand name ram which comes with the knowledge that you paid a bit more for your ram but at least it&#8217;s a brand name you can trust.

**[Kingston RAM: Best Selling Memory Upgrades][1]**

This applies to anything, really and not just ram. Even computers are priced this way &#8211; you can buy an Apple Computer  (and pay for the privilege) or you can buy a lesser bran  name.  Once I needed a PC to run some windows program so I found the  cheapest laptop I could find. It worked great for the price but support was non-exisitent as when I needed help with my PC (it was a windows machine. it&#8217;s only a matter of time before you need help) the company was long out of business. It was a no-name laptop and I got no-name support to match.

With RAM though you&#8217;re better off because even generic memory gets tested to work from the memory vendors before it ships and if you buy ram regardless of brand from the stores I list you won&#8217;t have a problem with RAM not working. These stores are all reputable memory vendors and I have mentioned this before.

Some brands you might see are toshiba, samsung, micron (which is crucial), lexar for digital camera ram&#8230;just to name a few. It all comes down to your comfort level and what&#8217;s most  important to you &#8211; getting the cheapest RAM you can buy or spending a  littl more for brand name ram. Your budget and memory needs  all come into play when you need to buy memory &#8211; brand name or generic, the choice is ultimately up to you.
