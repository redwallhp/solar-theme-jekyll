While we hang around and wait for the 2012 Apple iMacs to show up, I thought I&#8217;d take a look at the current offerrings from Apple in the iMac department. I mean, afterall &#8211; I do track iMac memory prices &#8211; it only makes sense to learn all I can about the 2012 iMac.

## The 2012 iMac Lineup

&nbsp;

Is really, the summer 2011 Apple iMacs as that&#8217;s the latest Apple iMac to come out of Apple. Except for MacBook Pro&#8217;s we haven&#8217;t seen one new computer from Apple this year. But seeing as how these are the best iMacs we&#8217;re going to see for a while it looks like, we may as well get to know [Apple&#8217;s best selling Apple Desktop computer. ][1]

## i5 Apple iMacs

**Apple iMac 21.5 inch 2.5Gz**

This iMac is the cheapest Apple iMac you can buy today. Starting at just $1199.00, you get a 2.5Ghz Intel i5 processor, a 500gb hard drive and 4GB of RAM. (add more ram &#8211; see the prices to your right)

**Apple iMac 21.5 inch 2.7Ghz**

If you&#8217;ve got a bit more money to spend, it might be worth it to check out the 2.7Ghz i5 iMac. You get more speed, and a bigger 1TB hard drive for $300 more. (I still think the cheaper iMac is the better deal)

**Apple iMac 27 inch 2.7Ghz**

If I were going to spend any money on an iMac, this is where I would start. The bigger real estate is a welcome addition to my workflow, and the price difference isn&#8217;t that bad-you have to find another $500 from the starter iMac but you get a faster processor and 1TB hard drive. You&#8217;re paying t a premium for the iMac screen but I think it&#8217;s worth the cost

**Apple iMac 27 inch 3.1Ghz **

Unless you have money  to burn  I would stay away from this model. To me, the biggest iMac isn&#8217;t the best deal on an iMac when you compare the 3.1Ghz model to other iMac models in 2012.

## i7 Apple iMacs

I wish. It turns out, there are no Apple iMacs available yet with faster i7 processors. There&#8217;s a complete selection of Apple i5 iMacs from which to choose but nope, no i7 Apple iMacs yet. Again, something to look forward to when Apple finally releases the 2012 Apple iMacs.
