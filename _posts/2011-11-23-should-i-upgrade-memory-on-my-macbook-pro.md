Oh good grief, **[YES you should][1].  **

[<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4190" title="add ram to macbook pro " src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Screen-Shot-2012-03-13-at-2.45.56-PM.png" alt="cheap macbook pro memory" width="296" height="305" />][2]

I never really understood why this question even needed to be asked. I mean when you consider the price you pay for even the cheapest MacBook Pro and then compare the cost of a RAM upgrade it makes no sense to me why when you buy a MacBook Pro you wouldn&#8217;t increase the MacBook Pro&#8217;s ram at the same time.

**The Price of MacBook Pro Memory **

An example. Let&#8217;s say you&#8217;re waiting for the new MacBook Pro to be released but you can&#8217;t wait &#8211; you need to buy a MacBook Pro today, so you go shopping for a deal and [you find one][2].  You manage to [save almost $80 on a brand new Apple MacBook Pro][3]. This means that compared to walking into the  [Apple Store][4] you shopped online, found a better deal on a MacBook Pro than you could  have got from Apple and you probably even qualified for free shipping too.

This leaves you with $79.00 in savings to do what with? Buy RAM for your MacBook Pro ! At the time I write this it costs about  $40 or so for 8GB of RAM and if you shop around for 16GB  you can get that too for not much more. But, for  the sake of this article we&#8217;ll stick with the 8GB as this doubles your RAM without terminating  your warranty. Apple currently only supports 8GB of RAM on the  MBP&#8217;s so we&#8217;ll stop there for now.

This leaves you with another $30 to buy a MacBook Pro  stand or  a small MacBook Pro case for you  new laptop.

Oh, the bonus is that you **have  enough RAM to do  other stuff  with**. I&#8217;m writing  this on a [**2011 Apple Mac Mini** ][5] (a birthday pressent)  and the very first thing I did  was upgrade my RAM. I&#8217;ve got a few windows open and iTunes running and I am  using over the 4GB the Mac Mini already shipped with.

What  happens when you don&#8217;t have enough memory? You use swap disk space  which is exponentially  slower and slows your system down considerably   &#8211; so  much  so that any speed  benefit you thought you may  have by buying a fast MacBook Pro could be negated when the swap disk kicks in.

MacBook Pro ram is not the cheapest it&#8217;s ever been, but close (It was down close to $30 for 8GB earlier this year), but even at the slightly  higher ram prices for Apple MacBook Pro,  upgrading  the RAM is the biggest bargain in computing today.

Here&#8217;s a few ram prices  for you to check out:
