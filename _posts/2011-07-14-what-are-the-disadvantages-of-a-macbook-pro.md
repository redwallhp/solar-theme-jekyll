MacBook Pros aren&#8217;t that much better and are even more expensive than the MacBook Air, with the 13  inch MacBook Pro still going  to cost you $1199.oo as your cheapest MacBook Pro option and the price can go up from there &#8211; depending on the screen size and configuration you end up with.

But, back to the **MacBook Pro and  the disadvantages it may have**,  and the very first thing that came to mind is that **[MacBook Pros are freaking expensive][1]**. Even the **cheapest mac you can buy, the [Mac Mini][2]** is a $700 purchase, and the cheapest way you can get  into any MacBook of any kind  is with an **[11 inch MacBook Air][3]**. Sure, it&#8217;s got the cachet that only comes with an Apple product but for what is essentially **Apple&#8217;s answer to a netbook**, the $999 sticker price is a **lot more than you&#8217;ll pay for a netbook running the windows OS** that will probably run you about $200 or so. Is theI&#8217;m an Apple Fan, and have been for some time. In fact,  this site started as just a hobby site. I bought web hosting, taught myself some basic html and have been listing the **best prices on RAM I could find** for close to fifteen years. Not  only **[MacBook Pro RAM][4]**but also I&#8217;ve even managed to **swing a few memory deals for you folks over the years** and some stores offer ram prices that are substantially lower than you could find anywhere else and are heavily discounted just for you.

**The cloud doesn&#8217;t care about your OS.**

When I started this site and  on a Mac of course, (I think it was an Apple IIci if I recall. I&#8217;m dating myself) I had to have programs to run and files to edit and the **Apple  operating system was leaps and bounds better than anything Windows** related.

But now in 2011, I work in the  cloud. I&#8217;m writing this with a 2008  MacBook for the simple reason I see no reason to upgrade my MacBook Pro at this time with anything better or bigger. And, I can&#8217;t  believe I&#8217;m going to confess this, but **I could do just fine on a $399 (or less) windows notebook:**

The programs I use are:

**[Photoshop Elements][5]**for the odd banner or graphics tweak. There&#8217;s a windows version too. It costs less if I remember for the windows version too. (but this may have changed)

FTP Program. I use **[Transmit][6]**, and  have for years.

[WordPress][7], which is a free download.

I&#8217;ve been working away on a Windows notebook I bought a few years ago for the past month or so as a test to see if I could handle using a **[much cheaper notebook PC][8]** as my one and only computer &#8211; and  for the most  part and for my needs (yours may differ) I really don&#8217;t notice much of a difference between the two OS&#8217;s and my 15 inch HP notebook cost me a fraction of a new MacBook Pro and for what I do, does the trick just fine.

This isn&#8217;t to say that the Apple MacBook Pro isn&#8217;t really worth it, and I appreciate the way the **Mac OS just works** without  having to fiddle  with operating systems and dll files and viruses and the like, and with twenty years plus of Apple computer use under my belt, it&#8217;s  hard to train an old dog new tricks. I still can&#8217;t get used to the right click thing with the windows OS, either Vista or Windows 7.

But for the up front savings when you compare a MacBook Pro to a Windows notebook, I wonder: **will my next Mac be a Windows PC?**
