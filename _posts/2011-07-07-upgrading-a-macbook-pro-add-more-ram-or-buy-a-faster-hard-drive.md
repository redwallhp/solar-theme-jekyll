Ulitmately, the answer would be to upgrade **both ram **and **hard drive for MacBook Pro **at the same time.

It&#8217;s best to upgrade both the MacBook Pro RAM and hard drive for the ultimate advantage and to get the **fastest speed out of your MacBook Pro,** regardless of whether you&#8217;re interested in upgrading a MBP for a 13 inch, 15 inch and even 17 inch model assuming you didn&#8217;t care about budget you could easily afford both a RAM upgrade and hard drive at the same time.

**Upgrade Your MacBook Pro RAM First **

[MacBook Pro RAM upgrades][1] are cheap and affordable, and a faster hard drive won&#8217;t do you any good if you&#8217;ve got a bottleneck with RAM and the processor is relying on much slower swap disc when it comes to needing to access data quickly and efficiently. If you&#8217;re just browsing the web, and what has become an increasing activity over time, and will only get more and more prevalent as time goes on thanks in part to the release of Apple&#8217;s iCloud there&#8217;s a good chance you don&#8217;t have to upgrade the memory on your Apple pro notebook computer.

But RAM for MacBook Pro in 2011 is the **[cheapest it&#8217;s been in some time][2]**, so if you were wondering on when to [buy Apple memory][3], the time would be now as **prices have never been lower for MacBook ram than right now**. It&#8217;s the lowest I have seen ram prices and you can now **[buy 8GB of MacBook RAM for well under $100][2].** You can also order 16GB memory but for the time being it&#8217;s still too pricey for me to recommend unless you have deep pockets or need the most memory you can install in a MacBook Pro regardless of Cost.

**Buy a Faster Hard Drive

[<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2430" title="Cheapest Solid State Hard Drive" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screen-shot-2011-07-07-at-2.53.37-PM.png" alt="Solid state hard drive under $100" width="298" height="260" />][4]

Your MacBook Pro already comes shipped with a fast hard drive installed, and the only way to really upgrade the MacBook Pro hard drive would be to upgrade to a larger sized hard drive that won&#8217;t really speed things up, but rather just allow you more space for your files, movies and images.

The best bet for a MacBook Pro hard drive upgrade in 2011 is to convert or swap out the hard drive in your MacBook Pro for a much more dependable and [faster solid state hard drive][5]. The downside to this advice is that to get a large SSD hard drive installed in your MacBook Pro you&#8217;re looking at big bucks. A 500gb solid state hard isn&#8217;t really available yet and even a 250GB solid state hard drive comes with a sticker price of $600, and that is in my opinion still too expensive.

But, if you can live with the smaller hard drive space a **[64GB solid state hard drive][4]** is **cheap and affordable solid state hard drive** and at the time of writing just under $100 too. What you could do, is install your MacBook hard drive in an [external hard drive case][6] allowing you the best of both worlds: A fast solid state hard drive for fast startup and access to commonly used files and and with your factory MacBook Pro hard drive installed in an external USB case you now have space for your less often used files or for a backup and you still make good use out of the factory MacBook Pro hard drive.

**Upgrade MacBook Pro Hard Drive and RAM  
**

If you really shop around, you can **max out the ram on your MacBook Pro for well under $100** and **[add a 64GB solid state hard drive][4]** for right at the $100 mark. Add a negligible cost for your USB hard drive case and you&#8217;ve got the **most ram and a faster hard drive in your MacBook Pro for under $200** (plus taxes, and shipping). If I were to **buy a new MacBook Pro**, or even wanted to **upgrade an older MacBook Pro** this is the route I would go as once you spend the relatively cheap amount of about $200 you are taking full advantage of the technology hidden inside your Apple MacBook Pro notebook computer.
