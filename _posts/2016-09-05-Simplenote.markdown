I keep on switching back and forth between simplenote and evernote. At times, evernote seems like too much when I all I want to do is to just cut and paste some code or text I want to remember later. 

This is available for Linux, and that's something that evernote is note so this maces this one of the better cross platform notes available.

> Light, clean, and free. Simplenote is now available for iOS, Android, Mac, Windows, Linux, and the web.
