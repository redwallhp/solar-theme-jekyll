William Gallagher (with Mike Wuerthele) ] [posted an article at MacNN][1] on what Apple might plan to do with the Mac Pro:

> You look at the profile of the Mac Pro longingly, and you have to wonder whether it&#8217;s been forgotten.
> 
> Of course, we thought that back in the beginning of 2013 when this new, cylindrical, tiny Mac Pro was announced. People had given up on ever seeing an update for the aluminum slab-side Mac Pro, they&#8217;d given up on Apple, and they felt that Apple had given up on its creative professional users, who were the company&#8217;s core audience for many years previously. 

I don&#8217;t think that Apple has forgotten about the Mac Pro, but it&#8217;s now a very specialized item that&#8217;s aimed at a specific group of users. Also now that the iMacs can be almost and [if not as fast][2] as the Mac Pros, I know that if I was in the Market for a new desktop and the speeds are about the same, I would want to buy the iMac because it includes a 5k display where the Mac Pro doesn&#8217;t. I think that feature alone would want me to chose the iMac.

The Mac Pro has never seen as regular updates as the other consumer based models and considering a 2013 Mac Pro is still holding it&#8217;s own over newer Macs, I don&#8217;t see the need for Apple to upgrade this model for some time yet.
