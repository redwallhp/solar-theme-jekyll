Some good reading here on what Federico would like to see on iOS 10:


[iOS 10: Wishes and Concept Video – MacStories](https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-10-wishes/)

> Every year, I put together a list of the changes I'd like to see in the next version of iOS. I've been doing this for several years now. This year, I wanted to prepare something bigger. The tenth version of iOS due to be released later this year will be a major milestone for Apple and iOS users. It only felt appropriate to celebrate the occasion with a different take on my annual iOS wish list.
