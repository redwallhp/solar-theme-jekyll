These Apple Performa models are pretty dated, with some going back 20 years or more. But, if you still have one that's in use you can get a bit more life out of by [adding some ram.](http://ramseeker.com/apple-performa-and-older-mac-memory-upgrades) For some of these models they are so old that itâ€™s near impossible to find ram from traditional memory vendors and your best bet is to[ check eBay for ram](http://ebay.com).
