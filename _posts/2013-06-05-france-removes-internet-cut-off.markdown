Microsoft is [offering a trade in program](https://easytradeup.com/us/en/pages/tradeup/home) where you can get up to $200.00 for your older PC or $300 for your Mac: 

> For your Trade-in to qualify for the promotion it must be a working, complete and undamaged Laptop or Macbook up to six years old. Laptops and Macbooks must have a minimum 11.3‚Äù display. Your Trade-in must be complete with a working battery and power supply. Please do not return monitors, keyboards or mice.

One interesting thing I noted that was [according the photos](https://easytradeup.com/us/en/pages/tradeup/trade-ins) you can even send them a Mac with missing keys. 

I'm not sure why you would ever want to do this and switching from a Mac to Windows seems like a bad idea all around and considering the price you can get for a Mac that's just six years old you're probably better off selling the Mac on your own and using the funds for your new Windows Machine.
