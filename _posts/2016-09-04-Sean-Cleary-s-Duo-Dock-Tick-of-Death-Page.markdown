I always had a soft spot for the Duo and back in the day could only afford the grayscale versions as the color was too rich for my blood. But, I did at one time own a duo dock and I always thought it was a great idea to dock your notebook to a bigger desktop when you got back to the office. 

But these older Duo docks tend to fail after a while: 

> Typical Symptoms
> 
> There is a periodic ticking from the dock, particularly after periods of being unplugged.
> This can become more frequent. In mild cases, the ticking will go away after the dock has been plugged in for an hour or two. In other cases, the dock ticks just after the Duo is ejected and may continue ticking for a while.
> Eventually, the dock becomes useless as it ticks instead of working. If the Duo is stuck inside, and won't eject, you may need to take the lid off to get it out. To do that, thin screwdrivers will be needed to press on the tabs since the Duo is in the way. Or you can wait and hope the ticking goes away and the Dock comes back to life for proper ejection.
> Avoiding having the dock unplugged seems to postpone the inevitable degeneration to uselessness.


The instructions on this page will get your old Duo dock up and running again:
