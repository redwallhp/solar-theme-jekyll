> Last year we published a Google Tag Manager Guide to help you start using Google Tag Manager for event tracking.  Since then, Google has upgraded all Google Tag Manager accounts to Version 2.  This updated Google Tag Manager tutorial contains revised information about how to use the new GTM v2 to track important events on your website like link clicks, downloads, and form submissions.
