I have recently switched this site over from Wordpress and I could not be happier with the Github Pages and Jekyll site.

It's fast and free, and once you get your workflow sorted out - it's even pretty easy. 


> Free hosting with GitHub Pages
> Sick of dealing with hosting companies? GitHub Pages are powered by Jekyll, so you can easily deploy your site using GitHub for free—custom domain name and all.
