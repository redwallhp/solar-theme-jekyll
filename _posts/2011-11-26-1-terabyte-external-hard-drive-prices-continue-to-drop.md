I&#8217;m old enough to remember when a 1GB hard drive was almost unthinkable, let alone a 1TB external hard drive, and now that 2TB and even 3 and 4GB hard drives come on to the market I thought I would take a look at some current real world street prices for a few external hard drives currently on sale:

&nbsp;

# [Toshiba Canvio Basics Portable Hard Drive 320 GB USB 2.0 External Hard Drive][1]

&nbsp;

Here&#8217;s an external hard drive from Toshiba that&#8217;s much cheaper than you could find for a 1TB model. Granted, it&#8217;s only 320GB compared to 1TB, but I could get my entire music collection on this hard drive and still have room left over. And the price can&#8217;t be beat for a small drive you can carry around with you that&#8217;s small enough to fit into your pocket or purse.



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# [Western Digital My Passport Essential SE 1 TB USB 3.0/2.0 Ultra Portable External Hard Drive][2]

&nbsp;

And if you do need more storage, the 1TB Western Digital Passport Essential Drive is one of the better deals for 1TB drives today. For a backup drive of Â all your important files and the like, the price for this hard drive could be priceless. The fact that it&#8217;s on sale today is a bonus too.  


# [Western Digital WD Elements 2 TB USB 2.0 Desktop External Hard Drive][3]

This hard drive from Western Digital offers even more storage space and for the price (not the suggested price &#8211; the real price you pay online) it might be the best deal on big external hard drive today. 2TB holds a lot of files and movies and music.  


# [Seagate FreeAgent GoFlex Desk 3 TB USB 3.0 External Hard Drive][4]

With a big 3TB hard drive like the GoFlex Desk 3TB USB 3.0 External hard drive you get even more storage space for even less money. If a 1TB drive is going to cost about $100,for a few dollars more you can have 3x the hard drive space when you compare the two hard drives and the cost the 3TB is the best cost to hard drive space ratio.

# [Western Digital My Passport Essential 500 GB USB 3.0/2.0 Portable External Hard Drive][5]

Lastly, the 500GB option is great for small and portable storage requirements today and a fantastic way to extend the space of your desktop or notebook space requirements. That 80GB drive you have in your notebook doesn&#8217;t seem so big now and these hard drives are a great way to expand the space without breaking the bank and having to buy a brand new notebook just because you ran out of storage space.
