this looks pretty neat: a [CMS for Jekyll.](http://cloudcannon.com) If you want a free site to host your pages, create one on [github pages](pages.githbub.com)&nbsp;and then when you hit published the content gets build and pushed to your github pages site easily

> The best of both worlds
> <br>Developers and non-developers easily collaborate on sites without stepping on each otherâ€™s toes.
>
> Developers have complete control over the source code and simply build static or Jekyll websites.
>
> Non-developers update content visually using the CloudCannon inline editor.
