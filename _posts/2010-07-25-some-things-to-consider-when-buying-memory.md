When you are in need of memory for computer &#8211; and this applies to all types of computers regardess of  computer maker or model &#8211; there are a few things to consider before you call your local computer shop, buy memory online or start to search eBay for your computer memory needs.

[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1375" title="Best Apple Computer Memory" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-8.22.30-PM.png" alt="Cheap Computer RAM" width="542" height="285" />][1]

**[Cheap Computer Memory][1]**

1. **Price**. Is the computer memory you are interested in for you particular computer priced competitively? You&#8217;re going to get a much better deal on your computer memory if you buy it from a third party memory store that specializes in memory for Apple for an example than if you buy the memory from Apple directly (although in recent times Apple memory from the Apple Store is getting more competitive)

2. **Compatibility**. Will the memory you want work in your computer without issue? Have all the manufacturer&#8217;s memory specifications been met so that when you go to install the memory you will be sure that the computer memory you bought works with your computer. Memory is fragile and susceptible to  damage from static electricity.  Installing bad ram could mean your computer does not run smoothly or even not at all after you installed bad ram.

3. **Customer service**. If your main objective is number 1 above, price, you may have to be wiling to be sacrifice customer service for price. Are you willing to make that sacrifice. Personally  I am not and  would much rather buy my ram from a memory store I know and trust. Better yet if the store specializes in nothing but memory.  If you make your living with your computer, ask yourself how much your time is worth. Do you have th time and patience  and are willing to sacrifice the potential of lost income, just because your memory failed due to the fact that you bought cheap ram from a questionable price.

The good news is you can buy ram with confidence and get numbers 1,2 and 3 when you buy the memory from one of the vendors I recommend. all and any of the memory stores you see on ramseeker have been in the comptuter memory business for over a decade and do nothing all day but to sell you the [best memory upgrades at the best price][2].

Whatever your memory ugpgrade needs might be, you owe it to yourself to get the best deal on the beset ram at the best price with the least amount of time and aggravation.
