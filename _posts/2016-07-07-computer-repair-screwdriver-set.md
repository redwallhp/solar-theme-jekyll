This screwdriver set for computer repairing is really cheap at under ten dollars, but it's served me well a few times and it seems to come with all the sizes and shapes of screwdrivers and spudgers and tweezers I could ever need for fixing computer or phones. I have especially found use of the pink phillips head screwdriver as it seems to be the standard size. 

These tools are not snap-on or craftsman quality but considering you get all this for about eight bucks, it's kind of hard to complain
