**13 inch 2.3 GHz  Apple MacBook Pro RAM Upgrade Prices  
**

The newest Apple MacBook Pro and also the **[cheapest MacBook Pro][1]** Apple has released this year could benefit from a memory upgrade, despite the [cheap price the smallest MacBook Pro is available for][2]. Out of the box, the [Apple MacBook Pro 13 inch 2.3GHz model][3] comes with a fast dual core Intel core i5 processor 4GB of DDR3 1333Mhz memory installed as factory default when it comes to MacBook Pro RAM configuration, that, while enough for running the operating system and some i Apps, such as iLife, iPhoto, and iMovie &#8211; [4GB of MacBook Pro RAM ][4]in 2011, really isn&#8217;t that much memory and you really should **upgrade the 13 inch MacBook Pro 2.3 Ghz model to double the installed memory** &#8211; if not more, if your budget will allow

With 16 GB MacBook Pro RAM now readily available *(but still pricey &#8211; 16GB MacBook Pro memory costs as much as the MacBook you&#8217;re installing into the 16GB ram option for MacBook Pro, this is still not really a viable option for most of us looking for a good deal on MacBook Pro memory for the new 13 inch MacBook Pro)*

The **8GB 13 inch MacBook Pro memory upgrade option**, with street prices of under $100 is a much more affordable and possible memory upgrade when it comes to RAM in the Apple MacBook Pro models.

**MacBook Pro Memory Upgrade Trade In Options  
**

What makes a [deal on MacBook Pro memory][5] even better is that you can sell, or trade in your factory installed RAM from your 13 inch MacBook Pro and get even a better deal on MacBook Pro RAM than the 13 inch MacBook Pro RAM Prices I list above when you buy RAM from [OEMPCWORLD][6], [RAMJET][7] and [OWC][8] &#8211; just three Mac Memory stores that will happily take your Apple factory RAM as trade, **saving you even more money on MacBook Pro RAM**.

**13 inch 2.3 GHz Memory Upgrade Options**

Out of the box, the Apple 13 inch MBP running at 2.3 GHz, ships with **4GB of RAM installed** in the two memory upgrade slots the 13 inch MacBook Pro offers for upgrade so the only viable memory upgrade choices will be either 8GB or 16GB, and as you can see from the memory prices above it still costs a pretty penny to make 16GB MacBook Pro ram upgrades happen.

This leaves the **8GB MacBook Pro Memory Upgrade Kit** as your best bet for memory upgrades on the new 13 inch 2011 MacBook Pro model, and a number of memory stores offer these RAM upgrades for under $100, which a much more realistic price for a memory upgrade for any laptop computer &#8211; not just Apple MacBook Pro&#8217;s.

**How To Upgrade RAM on 13 inch MacBook Pro 2.3Hz  
**

Once you&#8217;ve decided on what MacBook Pro RAM to buy (and I leave that part up to you, some might want to save the most money you can on MacBook Pro RAM others prefer to buy name brand RAM) you can easily install the RAM on 13 inch MBP&#8217;s, or any MacBook Pro model that requires 1333Mhz sodimms for memory upgrades yourself, saving you even more money, as you don&#8217;t need to take in your MacBook Pro to the Apple Store or any other Authorized Dealer who will charge you for installing RAM.

The memory upgrade slots on the 13 inch MacBook Pros are easily accessible and with some safety precautions and a bit of common sense you can remove the MacBook Pro factory RAM, install newer, larger MacBook Pro memory modules and be rewarded with a faster, smoother running Apple notebook computer that can open more applications at the same time. Apple even shows you [how to upgrade 2011 MacBook Pro RAM][9] all by yourself.

Essentially, all you have to do to replace or upgrade the RAM on the 13 inch 2.3 Ghz MacBook Pro is the following:

  1. Remove the bottom case of the 13 inch MacBook Pro. There&#8217;s ten screws holding down the bottom cover that you need to remove and remember not to loose any of the screws, as you will need to re-install those ten screws when the ram upgrade is complete
  2. Discharge any static electricity you may have on you. RAM and static electricity  don&#8217;t mix. You may even want to buy an anti-static wrist strap for  a few dollars to be extra safe.
  3. Remove the factory RAM. There&#8217;s two little tabs, or wings that you spread apart to allow the MacBook Pro RAM to be removed. The RAM then pops up so you can grab it and pull it gently from the memory upgrade  slot.  First do this for the top memory slot and then again for the bottom memory slot.

Then you just do the reverse to install the MacBook Pro memory upgrades with larger 4GB memory upgrade modules. The 1333Mhz sodimms only go in the MacBook Pro one way  thanks to a slot in the module yourself, so  you really can&#8217;t screw this up &#8211; line up the slot with the memory upgrade slot on the Macbook Pro and push until the ram upgrade is seated, and then click the MacBook Pro RAM back in so the little plastic tabs or wings lock it in place.

Replace the cover with with those ten screws you put away carefully, turn over your MacBook Pro and power it up and you&#8217;ll rewarded with a MacBook Pro with double the memory upgrades that Apple  installed at the factory, and you get to experience the full power hidden inside your 13 inch MacBook Pro 2.3HGhz
