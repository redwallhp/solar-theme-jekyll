**[2011 Apple MacBook Pro][1]**models were released yesterday and offer many improvments over the 2010 MacBook Pros, yet are still available in same 3 different screen sizes: 13 inch MacBook Pro, 15 inch MacBook Pro and 17 inch MacBook Pro models

### [13 inch Apple MacBook Pro][2]

[<img class="size-full wp-image-980 alignleft" title="13 inch macbook pro price" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Screen-shot-2011-02-25-at-3.35.10-PM.png" alt="best price MacBook Pro" width="281" height="220" />][2]

The 2011 **[13 inch Apple Macbook Pro][2]** notebooks are available in two configurations:

**[13 inch Apple MacBook Pro 2.3Ghz  
][2] **

The first being the [cheapest Apple MacBook][3] Pro you can buy today with a MSRP of just $1199, this **[cheap MacBook Pro][2]** might be one to consider instead of a MacBook as it offers a lot more performance for about $200 more than what you would spend if you were to buy a MacBook instead.

The entry level MacBook Pro is a 13 inch configuration and offers the following as the main specifications:

  1. 2.3 GHz dual core Intel core i5 processor
  2. 4GB of DDR3 1333Mhz Memory installed
  3. 320GB hard drive running at 5400 RPM
  4. Intel HD Graphics 3000 graphics card
  5. A built in battery that lasts up to 7 hours

If you **[buy the MacBook Pro 13 inch 2.3 GHz ][2]**from the Apple Store directly there are more options allowing you to customize your 13 inch MacBook Pro by adding more RAM, hard drive options include both serial ATA drives and newer SSD hard drives that offer much faster performance than what traditional hard drives offer.

You can also buy an **[Apple Display][4]** and an **[Apple Mouse][5]** and Keyboard for the times you do need more screen real estate than what the smallest Apple MacBook Pro can offer.

Of course, the **13 inch 2.3 GHz MacBook Pro **will run better with more software and **[iWork][6]** and **[Aperture][7]** and **[Final Cut Pro are][7]** also on sale as are **[logic express 9][7]**, **[FileMaker][8]** and **[Microsoft Office][4]** will turn any MacBook Pro you choose to buy in 2011 into a fully complete portable computing solution.

Lastly, the 13 inch Apple MacBook Pro 2.3GHz is available with extended AppleCare, One to One membership and accessories such as cables and MacBook Pro cases all at additional cost.

**13 inch Apple MacBook Pro 2.7GHz  
**  
13 inch Apple MacBook Pro 2.7 GHz is the faster 13 inch MacBook Pro and offers a faster processor with a 2.7GHz Intel Core i7 processor and bigger hard drive at 500GB being the two main differences between the 2.3GHz and 2.7Ghz 13 inch MacBook Pro. All else stays the same as the cheapest MacBook Pro except for the price which is $300 more than the low end model with a MSRP of $1499.

### [15 inch Apple MacBook Pro][9]

[<img class="size-full wp-image-984 alignleft" title="15 inch Apple MacBook Pro " src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Screen-shot-2011-02-25-at-3.39.18-PM.png" alt="best price 15 inch MacBook Pro" width="291" height="225" />][9]

The **[Apple 15 inch MacBook Pro][9]** is another new Apple MacBook but with another two inches of screen real estate when compared to the 13 inch models. You may sacrifice a bit on portability when you compare the two models side by side but for some the 13 inch MacBook Pro is just too small a screen to work with

**[Apple MacBook Pro 15 inch 2.0GHz  
][9] **

The cheaper 15 inch Apple MacBook Pro of the two Apple MacBook Pro models available in the 2011 MBP Pro lineup is the 15 inch 2.0 GHz model that boasts the following features as standard equipment:

  1. A 2.0Ghz Quad Core Intel Core i7 Processor
  2. 4GB 1333MHz DDR3 RAM
  3. 500 GB 5400RPM Hard Drive
  4. Intel HD Graphics 3000 AMD Radeon HD 6490M with 256MB GDDR5
  5. Built in Battery lasting up to 7 hours

All this is priced at just $1799, which is the suggested list price for the Apple MacBook Pro 15 inch 2.2GHz, but you can get a [better deal on the MacBook Pro][9] by shopping online from other various online stores for sales and deals as most others offer a bit better price on the 15 inch MacBook Pros than if you were to [buy a 15 inch MacBook Pro][9] from Apple.

**[Apple MacBook Pro 15 inch 2.2GHz  
][9] **

The higher end 15 inch MacBook offers a faster processor and runs at 2.2 GHz using the same Intel i7 processor but just a tad faster for power users looking for the fastest 15 inch MacBook Pro Apple makes today. Other features on the 2.2GHz Apple MacBook Pro are:

  1. 4GB DDR3 1333MHz Memory
  2. Intel HD Graphics 3000
  3. AMD Radeon HD 6750M with 1GB GDDR5
  4. Built in Battery lasting up to 7 hours

The processor is faster, the hard drive is bigger and the graphics card on the high end 15 inch MBP is much faster, and those are the main differences between the 2 MacBook Pro 15 inch models save for the price which is listed as $2199 when you buy a MacBook Pro from Apple, but I you can get a better MacBook Pro 15 inch Price shopping online from other online stores and resources.

### [17 inch Apple MacBook Pro][10]

[<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-986" title="17 inch Apple MacBook Pro" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Screen-shot-2011-02-25-at-3.49.00-PM.png" alt="Apple MacBook Pro 17 inch" width="280" height="216" />][10]

The **[17 inch Apple MacBook Pro][10]** is for a lot of users, a desktop replacement thanks to the big and bright LCD display that graces the MacBook Pro at the high end of the MBP lineup. The 2.2 GHz is the same speed with the same processor than the 15 inch 2.2 GHz MacBook Pro but the 17 incher offers much more real estate in the screen dept. Priced at another $300 more than the 15 inch model but all other specifications being the same it will be up to you whether you deem the added 2 inches of display space to be worth the extra costs.

Apple has come out with an impressive MacBook Pro lineup, but I&#8217;m surprised that the maximum memory is not 16GB on these professional Apple notebooks, as the iMac ha been boasting a 16GB ram maximum for some time now. Perhaps this is on purpose so as not to cannibalize the iMac sales, or more likely the technology or space just isn&#8217;t there yet. 8GB ram modules in DDR3 1333Mhz would be cost prohibitive at this point anyway so maybe Apple&#8217;s on the right track with this latest MacBook Pro lineup.

**What&#8217;s new on all MacBook Pros for 2011  
**

A slew of new features across the board make the 2011 Apple MacBook Pros a best buy this year when it comes to the new professional MacBooks:

**Faster Processors  
**

Starting with the 13 inch MacBook Pro, the slowest MacBook Pro of the bunch still offer dual core Intel i5 Processors and the 15 inch and 17 inch MacBook Pros offer quad core i7 processors making the the newest Apple MacBooks up to twice as fast as the previous models.

**ThunderBolt  
**  
Thunderbolt is new technology from Apple introduced first on the MacBook Pro lineup that allows you to use one connector running at up to 10MBps to connect both external peripherals and displays as well, offering less cables and faster speeds when communicating with external devices. USB just got old.

**Faster Graphics  
** Newer graphics cards with up to 1GB of RAM eliminate any bottleneck in the processing of graphics. Perfect for grapics professionals such as those using Aperture 3 or Adobe Photoshop.

**HD Face Time  
**

Face Time, Apple&#8217;s full screen video call technology goes HD that are sharper and more crisp than the video produced in previous MacBook Pro models

Included when you buy any new MacBook Pro model in 2011 is the MacBook Pro portable computer, the Magsafe Power Adapter, wall plug and power cord and included software dvds and a display polishing cloth to keep your new MacBook Display like the day you bought it.

Lastly the MacBook Pro models, regardless of screen size come with Mac OS Snow Leopard and iLife &#8217;11 which includes iPhoto, iMove, GarageBand, iWeb and iDVD which all allow you to control, create and discover your photos, movies, and music on Apple&#8217;s new MacBook Pro professional notebook computers.
