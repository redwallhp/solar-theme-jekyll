The **[Apple MacBook Pro 13 inch 2.7 GHz][1]** is the smallest, lightest, and [fastest 13 inch MacBook Pro you can buy in 2011][2], but there&#8217;s one cheap (or, not so cheap if you choose to upgrade this [MacBook Pro to 16GB upgrade][3] I recommend that at the time of writing this, you can do for under $100 that will result in even a faster MacBook Pro than what Apple ships from the factory.

It truly boggles my mind why, if all the 2011 [MacBook Pro models can accept 8GB of RAM ][4]that Apple doesn&#8217;t release All their notebook models and consumer desktops like the **[iMac][5]** and **[Mac Mini][6]**with the maximum memory already installed, but for some reason they don&#8217;t and it&#8217;s probably to stay more competitive in price with windows PCs, there&#8217;s a reason [the 13 inch 2.3 GHz MacBook Pro][7] is the best selling notebook available today, and that&#8217;s due to the fact that it&#8217;s also the [cheapest MacBook Pro you can buy today][8] &#8211; filling the 13 inch MBP with memory would raise the cost because as you can see from the chart above &#8211; **RAM isn&#8217;t free**.

**MacBook Pro RAM is Cheap  
**  
While you still have to pay for ram upgrades for the MacBook Pro and with the exceptions of [16GB RAM for the 2011 MacBook Pros][3] &#8211; 8GB of MacBook Pro RAM is pretty cheap, especially if you consider the fact that for most of us MacBook Pro users &#8211; we&#8217;re earning living with this Apple laptop that&#8217;s the fastest, smallest portable from Apple you can buy today.

**Buy 8GB Memory Upgrades for MacBook Pro  
**

[8GB of RAM for MacBook Pro][9] is where the sweet spot is when it comes to ram upgrades for not only this Apple MacBook Pro model, but 15 inch and 17 inch MacBook Pro&#8217;s too. Sure, you can buy 16GB but only from a select few memory stores that carry 16GB for MacBook Pro and currently priced at $1599, this is price out of realistic prices for most of us, save for a few who need the ultimate ram upgrade for MacBook Pro.

8GB of MacBook Pro RAM double the ram installed on the faster 13 inch MacBook Pro but still costs under $100 &#8211; a paltry sum when you compare the price against the original price you paid on the faster smaller MBP.

Now that we&#8217;ve decided that 8GB of RAM is where we need to be, the trick is to buy macbook pro ram. Above are current street prices on MacBook Pro memory with regular price updates by yours truly, and these are all [memory stores I trust][10] when it comes to upgrading RAM for the MacBook Pro 13 incher. RAM is fragile electronics, and you want to buy a quality memory upgrade product and not some junk with an unknown origin or even more important &#8211; customer support, another factor to consider when buying MacBook Pro RAM.

**Buying RAM from Apple  
**

You can, and you&#8217;ll get fantastic customer support and a quality memory upgrade as the MacBook Pro ships with Samsung or Micron memory, or at least &#8211; that&#8217;s been my experience when upgrading RAM on my personal MacBook Pro models. But the kicker with buying memory from Apple is the price &#8211; at the time I write this, an [8GB memory upgrade from Apple][11] direct will cost you $400. The lowest price for MacBook Pro RAM above is <del>$93.00 </del>**$59.99** which makes it worthwhile in my opinion to shop around for the best deal on RAM upgrades for the 13 inch 2.7GHz MacBook Pro from Apple, as an over $300 savings is enough to buy an iPod or something else than spending unnecessarily on Apple memory upgrades.

**How to Upgrade MacBook Pro 2.7 GHz Memory  
**

Once you figured out what memory store to buy Apple MacBook RAM from, the next step is to install it yourself for even more savings on MacBook Pro RAM Upgrades as it&#8217;s easy to do and won&#8217;t void your limited warranty your new 2011 MacBook Pro comes with.

**Trade in your MacBook Pro Memory**

For even a greater deal on MacBook Pro RAM, you can trade in your RAM that came as standard memory on the 13 inch MacBook Pro and stores like [RAMJET][12] and [OWC][13] will even pay you for your old ram which, if you do your homework will increase the savings you can see on MacBook Pro memory.

**How To Install MacBook Pro Memory for the 13 inch 2.7GHz Apple MacBook Pro **

This particular Macbook Pro model, which applies to all 2011 Apple MacBook Pros all can accept up to 8GB of memory using DDR3 1333Mhz so-dimms in the two memory upgrade slots available for upgrade. This means that you&#8217;ll have to remove the factory Apple RAM (and sell it or trade it for maximum savings) and buy and install an 8GB memory upgrade kit which consists of two 4GB ddr3 1333Mhz memory upgrade modules.

Once you have the new and bigger ram for MacBook Pro ready to go, all you need now is to do the MacBook Pro RAM upgrade yourself and it&#8217;s [super easy to do so][14] with just a philips screwdriver and a bit of common sense.

On the 2011 Apple MacBook Pro&#8217;s you remove the entire MacBook Pro bottom that covers the memory upgrade slots and you&#8217;ll see the memory upgrades right there underneath the cover where you can easily access the MBP&#8217;s ram upgrade slots for easy access.

I have already supplied [MacBook Pro RAM upgrade instructions][14] for the [cheaper 13 inch MacBook Pro][7] so I won&#8217;t repeat myself again, but I will express that static electricity is the enemy when it comes to memory upgrades so please pay attention to the instructions on **how to install Macbook Pro RAM supplied by Apple** for the proper way to discharge static electricity from yourself before you go touching sensitive memory parts.

To summarize: **[buy 8GB of MacBook Pro RAM cheap][15]** and install it yourself at no cost other than time, (and possibly a screwdriver) and you&#8217;ll be rewarded with the **[fastest MacBook Pro money can buy in 2011][8]**.
