**June 2012** &#8211; You can now, at long last install 16GB of RAM into a MacBook Pro into the Newest 2012 13 inch and 15 inch Apple MacBook Pro models, but if you want to buy the MacBook Pro with Retina Display you&#8217;re hosed when it comes to installing ram after purchase. Like the MacBook Air the ram on the soon to be best selling MacBook Pro is soldered to the motherboard and thus, unremovable and not able to accept an upgrade.

**September 2011.** [Crucial Technology][1] now carries [8GB DDR3 SODIMMS][2] at reasonable prices making the 16GB MacBook Pro RAM Upgrades affordable for professionals needing the most RAM possible for the Apple MacBook  Pro.

[table id=15 /]

**Update**:16GB RAM for MacBook Pro is now available from [OWC][3] and more memory vendors as time goes by. At the time I write this, 16GB MacBook Pro RAM is far from cheap and might cost more than the MacBook Pro you intend to install it in. Check here For [current MacBook Pro RAM 16GB prices][4]

**[8GB DDR3 for Apple MacBook Pro ][5]**

Two words: not yet.

For 16GB MacBook Pro RAM at the time being anyway. 8GB is the most memory you can  install in the MacBook Pros currently.  This will change I guarantee it. The question is: when? When will I be able to install and use MacBook Pro RAM that&#8217;s 16GB?

When did Apple release the last batch of MacBook Pros? Spring 2010, right? And just a week or so ago, Apple announced the new iMacs and they can easily use 16GB of RAM and are the first to do so ( Well,&#8230;OK, the Mac Pro&#8217;s too, soon enough).

But when will the MacBook Pros be able to use 16GB of Memory  (wow, I remember when 16MB was a lot of ram for an apple computer). I would guess we will see new MacBook Pros in late fall or MacWorld 2011 might be a good time to announce the new MacBook Pros too. (this assumes Apple releases computers only arranged around the Macworld shows which doesn&#8217;t seem to be the case lately. This used to be a big deal &#8211; the macworld trade shows, but with the internet growing and growing you don&#8217;t have to have a trade show much any more really. If Apple sneezes it&#8217;s online or tweeted or live blogged  in milliseconds anyway)

Back to my crystal ball gazing about when we&#8217;ll see new MacBook Pros that could take 16GB of memory and as I said earlier: late 2010 or early 2011. I have NO inside info, but this is just an educated guess.  It might be later if apple just does a simple speed bump to the MacBook Pros and uses the same 1066MHz memory.

The biggest problem with squeezing 16GB into a MBP is just that: room. Pretty much every Mac portable has offered 1 and lately two memory upgrade slots, for the simple reason that as small as they are: so-dimms are still pretty big and there&#8217;s also lots of other things in your apple notebook that needed to be squeezed into tight spaces too.

So that means that we could be waiting for a bit. Assuming only 2 memory upgrade slots, there would have to be not only the technology to recognize and accept 16GB on any new future MacBook Pros there would also need to be 8GB macbook memory modules which I have yet to come across.

If you&#8217;re looking for 16GB MacBook Pro RAM you might be waiting for a while until the technology catches up. It will, it&#8217;s just a matter of when you can [buy 16GB MacBook Pro RAM][6]
