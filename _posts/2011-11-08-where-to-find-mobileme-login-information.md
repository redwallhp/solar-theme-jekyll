MobileMe from Apple is Apple&#8217;s first (and in my opinion, failed) attempt at iCloud. The big feature of  MobileMe was email synchronization between your Apple iPhone, Mac, or even Windows PC, as well as being able to sync your photos from iPhoto, calendar from iCal and to sync any data from iDisk.

I never really used anything other than the email sycnhronization between my MacBook Pro and iPhone and even though it was expensive at $100/year for this service, it worked pretty well. and I never used the find my iphone service as I never did lose my iPhone. I did launder my iPhone at one point and the iPhone did not take to being washed and dryed too well. The only solution was to buy a new Apple iPhone.  Thankfully, my service provider in Canada (rogers) felt sorry for me and valued me as a customer and offered me a deal on a replacement iPhone as opposed to having to buy a replacement iphone at  full price.

Anway, back to the MobileME Login: One of the biggest advantages I found with mobileme email was that it allowed me to have access to my email anywhere I had access to a notebook (mac or pc, no difference)  where I could login and read and reply to my email on a more comfortable computing environment. Yes, I could have used my iPhone but sometimes I travel to the US and the data charges for using your iPhone in the USA are astronomical and this is where the value of mobileme  really shone as it allowed me to still check my email while away.

To login to your mobile me account, all you really need to do is [visit me.com][1] or [mobileme.com][2] and enter your username and password. With the announcement of iCloud, the end is near for mobile me as iCloud from Apple seems to be a better product than what Mobile Me ever was. The folks at Apple extended my mobileme membership for  well into next year &#8211; a nice gesture considering I was paying $100 a year for their service.

Mobile Me reviews stated that this could have been a much better service, and I think with iCloud Apple got it even better but if you just need a way to sync your email from your mobileme account to your phone I found the Mobile Me service worked pretty well for me and to me it was worth the 8 bucks or so a month to have email on my iPhone and my Mac fully synchronized.
