Apple MacBook Pro 2.3GHz Intel Core i7 (15-inch DDR3) was first introduced in February of 2011 featured Intel’s recently refined chipsets. The new Intel Core i7 architecture put the processor, cache, memory controller and graphics engine on a single chip—an innovative step that reduced the distance that data had to travel, thereby vastly increasing performance as well as processing efficiency.

The MacBook Pro 2.3 GHz Intel Core i7 15 inch boasted Turbo Boost 2.0 an even more efficient version of the original Turbo Boost which was described by Apple as a “dynamic performance technology that dramatically increases the speed of active cores”. Turbo Boost 2.0 worked by automatically shifting core frequency in smaller increments, which allows the processor to manage performance without a loss of efficiency and because this happens automatically—the user notices only that their computing is faster and smoother.  
Further enhancing speed in the MacBook Pro 2.3 GHz i7 15 inch was the now standard use of hyper-threading technology.

This dynamic processor improvement enabled two threads to run simultaneously on each core. The end result was that Mac OSX could now recognize eight cores on a quad core processor, four on a dual core processor. To the end user, this translated to tasks spread evenly across a greater number of cores so that multiple applications could be run simultaneously more smoothly, quickly and reliably.
