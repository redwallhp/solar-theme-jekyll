Ars Technica has [one of the most thorough reviews][1] on Android&#8217;s operating system spanning over 12 pages:

> Marshmallow makes many long-requested features a reality with selectable app permissions, a data backup system that actually works, and the ability to format SD cards as Ext4, allowing the system to treat cards just like internal storage. Marshmallow is also prepared for the future with support for USB Type-C&#8217;s power delivery spec, a Fingerprint authentication API, and 4K display support. And, as with any Android release, there&#8217;s also lots of new Googley stuffâ€”a slick new search interface and a contextual search mode called &#8220;Google Now on Tap,&#8221; for example. 

As a current Android user I&#8217;m interested to see what Marshmallow looks like in real life, but in the meantime this article is a great way to explore Google&#8217;s new software
