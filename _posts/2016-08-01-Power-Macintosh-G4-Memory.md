I have a fond spot for the Apple PowerMac G4 models as they were the first desktop computers with the 'velocity engine' (if I remember correctly). Apparently I bought the much lesser loved ‘yikes’ model, but for what I did this computer served me well and allowed me to work on this here site for years. 

Anyway, the ram: you will need either [PC 100](http://amzn.to/2aGIIW1) or [PC 133](http://amzn.to/2aIKFDd) 168-pin DIMMS for this line with the exception of the later 2002 and 2003 models that accepted [PC-2700](http://amzn.to/2aoe6ui) SDRAM
