I have long been curating ram prices online and now it&#8217;s time for a new approach. I have tried different approaches as the demand for ram prices have declined now that Apple and a lot of other manufacturers don&#8217;t allow for ram upgrades to be done by the end user but nothing has really resonated with me to date.

I had thought about just writing articles about Apple and the like, but I am no news site nor do I have the time or interest to grab all the news. Also, my interests are widespread and not just Apple. I am interested in books, photography and other subjects just like you are, and over the course of the day I tend to visit these sites related to these topics and some times they have good stuff that at very least is worth a look and this is where I plan to do this from now on, and link out as much as I can

If you&#8217;re interested in just Apple news curated there a a lot of sites that do it better than I ever could like [Macintouch][1], [Macsurfer][2] for news and [MacPrices][3] and [DealMac][4] for deals on Apple stuff and more but I need to have a place to share the stuff I find online in addition to just tracking ram prices and I figure that April Fool&#8217;s day is the perfect time to start such an adventure.

From time to time I may write an article or two when I have a thought or idea that I want to expand on further, but I will stick to what I do best &#8211; and that&#8217;s curate the stuff that interests me &#8211; just like ram and memory prices did so many years ago when I first started this site. And speaking of ram prices, I **will still track them** and you can find the perfect ram for your Mac from the menus on the top of the page just like always. Whether you&#8217;re looking to upgrade the ram on a ten year old iBook or the latest iMac (one of the few Apple computers you can still add ram upgrades to) there will still be a memory upgrade price chart for you to check. RAM price updates are not going anywhere.

[Macintouch][1] also has a pretty good April fool&#8217;s joke &#8211; I actually think with a few tweaks he should keep it this way all year. (update &#8211; the site is back to normal but you can see the joke [here][17]

[Apple Sliced][26] is a website that monitors prices and price drops on Apple Apps. It looks like quite the job to keep up on all the pricing drops and there seems to be a lot of stuff to wade through but if you&#8217;re looking for a deal on an app, this  might be worth a look. They  also track memory prices too. I thought I was the only one left that was still doing this.

[ComputerWorld][27] reviews the 13inch MacBook Pro with the force trackpad

[$149.00 Laptop][28] It probably doesn&#8217;t get any cheaper than this when it comes to buying a notebook computer.

[System Folder][31] is a website by [Ricardo Mori][32] that I like to drop in on from time to time because it&#8217;s a great way to revisit your youth if you were an Apple Fan back in the late &#8217;80&#8217;s and early &#8217;90s. One recent article was about trying to get internet on his color classic. It&#8217;s [worth the click][33] just to see those old screenshots of OS&#8217;s gone by.
