    Sony receivers for both home theater use and even stereo listening can be great bargains, if you shop around and analyze your needs on what you plan on using the 5.1 receiver for. All come with a plethora of features that include several audio and video inputs, HDMI in and out, and a stereo tuner for AM and FM listening. Of course, being a 5.1 receiver from Sony, that means there are also front speakers, a center speaker and surround speaker connectors to. You'll need to buy your speakers for your sony receiver separately, and there's too many options to list here today. But, let's look at a few Sony 5.1 Receivers and their prices. One of these should be the best Sony receiver for you.

    <h1>Sony STRDH520 7.1 Channel 3D AV Receiver</h1>
    <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006U1VGQU/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B006U1VGQU&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=ramseeker-20"><img class="size-full wp-image-6169 alignleft" title="best sony receiver" alt="cheapest sony receiver" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Screen-Shot-2012-08-23-at-8.05.56-AM.png" width="461" height="356" /></a>
    
    This Sony is a 7.1 vs 5.1 receiver, but don't worry about that as all this means is there are an extra set of surround speaker connectors on the back of the receiver, and you don't need to use them if you don't need or want to. This is one of the best selling home theater receivers under $300 and definitely worth consideration thanks to it's impressive feature set:
    <ul>
    	<li>100 watts per channel for all seven channels.</li>
    	<li>6 HD connections. Four are HDMI and 2 component video</li>
    	<li>3D Pass Thru</li>
    	<li>HD Digital Cinema Sound</li>
    	<li>Dolby TrueHD, Pro logic IIz and dts HD enhanced audio codecs</li>
    </ul>
    This is a full featured receiver for both audio and HT from Sony, and the best part is all this<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004NHCGJO/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004NHCGJO&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=ramseeker-20"><strong> only costs a little over $200. </strong></a>
    
    But what if you need more features and want to spend a little more money for a Sony receiver to get those features? The Sony mentioned above might be the best budget receiver from Sony, but it may not be the best overall deal. Sometimes, it's best to spend a bit more money on a Sony receiver.
    <h1>Sony STRDH830 Sony 3D 7.1 Channel A/V Receiver</h1>
    This Sony <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006U1VGQU/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B006U1VGQU&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=ramseeker-20"><strong>will cost you a bit more money</strong></a>, double in fact compared to the cheaper STRDH5220 above, but you get one important feature that I think every receiver for 2012 should have, and that's iPod connectivity. The Apple iPod has become the defacto standard when it comes to portable music, but when you're at home or office you want to listen to something with a little more oooph, and the Sony receiver above offers that in spades and will sound much better than the Apple earbuds that came with your Apple iPod.
    
    The best part? This Sony receiver even includes an Apple iPod dock, unlike some other brands that force you to buy an iPod dock for your stereo or home theater receiver separately. This is the perfect marriage between the two biggest electronics companies in the world today.
    
    Besides the fact that you can use the iPod with this receiver, the Sony STRDH830 also offers more power (140 watts, instead of 100 watts), another HDMI input (5 vs 4), the ability to upscale analog video to 1080i, an advanced on-screen digital display, Digital audio calibration for perfect sound from all your speakers, and Bravia sync so you only need one remote control when used in conjunction with your Sony Bravia HDTV.
    
    Overall, I think that this is the much better value receiver from the two. Yes, you pay more up front, but the higher end Sony includes an iPod dock, and connectivity options, and I know for me, that's worth much much more than the minimal increase in cost.

    Sony receivers for both home theater use and even stereo listening can be great bargains, if you shop around and analyze your needs on what you plan on using the 5.1 receiver for. All come with a plethora of features that include several audio and video inputs, HDMI in and out, and a stereo tuner for AM and FM listening. Of course, being a 5.1 receiver from Sony, that means there are also front speakers, a center speaker and surround speaker connectors to. You'll need to buy your speakers for your sony receiver separately, and there's too many options to list here today. But, let's look at a few Sony 5.1 Receivers and their prices. One of these should be the best Sony receiver for you.

    <h1>Sony STRDH520 7.1 Channel 3D AV Receiver</h1>
    <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006U1VGQU/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B006U1VGQU&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=ramseeker-20"><img class="size-full wp-image-6169 alignleft" title="best sony receiver" alt="cheapest sony receiver" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Screen-Shot-2012-08-23-at-8.05.56-AM.png" width="461" height="356" /></a>
    
    This Sony is a 7.1 vs 5.1 receiver, but don't worry about that as all this means is there are an extra set of surround speaker connectors on the back of the receiver, and you don't need to use them if you don't need or want to. This is one of the best selling home theater receivers under $300 and definitely worth consideration thanks to it's impressive feature set:
    <ul>
    	<li>100 watts per channel for all seven channels.</li>
    	<li>6 HD connections. Four are HDMI and 2 component video</li>
    	<li>3D Pass Thru</li>

    But what if you need more features and want to spend a little more money for a Sony receiver to get those features? The Sony mentioned above might be the best budget receiver from Sony, but it may not be the best overall deal. Sometimes, it's best to spend a bit more money on a Sony receiver.

The Apple iPod has become the defacto standard when it comes to portable music, but when you're at home or office you want to listen to something with a little more oooph, and the Sony receiver above offers that in spades and will sound much better than the Apple earbuds that came with your Apple iPod.
    
    The best part? This Sony receiver even includes an Apple iPod dock, unlike some other brands that force you to buy an iPod dock for your stereo or home theater receiver separately. This is the perfect marriage between the two biggest electronics companies in the world today.
    
    Besides the fact that you can use the iPod with this receiver, the Sony STRDH830 also offers more power (140 watts, instead of 100 watts), another HDMI input (5 vs 4), the ability to upscale analog video to 1080i, an advanced on-screen digital display, Digital audio calibration for perfect sound from all your speakers, and Bravia sync so you only need one remote control when used in conjunction with your Sony Bravia HDTV.
    
    Overall, I think that this is the much better value receiver from the two. Yes, you pay more up front, but the higher end Sony includes an iPod dock, and connectivity options, and I know for me, that's worth much much more than the minimal increase in cost.

    Sony receivers for both home theater use and even stereo listening can be great bargains, if you shop around and analyze your needs on what you plan on using the 5.1 receiver for. All come with a plethora of features that include several audio and video inputs, HDMI in and out, and a stereo tuner for AM and FM listening. Of course, being a 5.1 receiver from Sony, that means there are also front speakers, a center speaker and surround speaker connectors to. You'll need to buy your speakers for your sony receiver separately, and there's too many options to list here today. But, let's look at a few Sony 5.1 Receivers and their prices. One of these should be the best Sony receiver for you.

    This Sony is a 7.1 vs 5.1 receiver, but don't worry about that as all this means is there are an extra set of surround speaker connectors on the back of the receiver, and you don't need to use them if you don't need or want to. This is one of the best selling home theater receivers under $300 and definitely worth consideration thanks to it's impressive feature set:
    <ul>
    	<li>100 watts per channel for all seven channels.</li>
    	<li>6 HD connections. Four are HDMI and 2 component video</li>
    	<li>3D Pass Thru</li>
    	<li>HD Digital Cinema Sound</li>
    	<li>Dolby TrueHD, Pro logic IIz and dts HD enhanced audio codecs</li>

One of these should be the best Sony receiver for you.

# Sony STRDH520 7.1 Channel 3D AV Receiver

[<img class="size-full wp-image-6169 alignleft" title="best sony receiver" alt="cheapest sony receiver" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Screen-Shot-2012-08-23-at-8.05.56-AM.png" width="461" height="356" />][1]

This Sony is a 7.1 vs 5.1 receiver, but don&#8217;t worry about that as all this means is there are an extra set of surround speaker connectors on the back of the receiver, and you don&#8217;t need to use them if you don&#8217;t need or want to. This is one of the best selling home theater receivers under $300 and definitely worth consideration thanks to it&#8217;s impressive feature set:

  * 100 watts per channel for all seven channels.
  * 6 HD connections. Four are HDMI and 2 component video
  * 3D Pass Thru
  * HD Digital Cinema Sound
  * Dolby TrueHD, Pro logic IIz and dts HD enhanced audio codecs

This is a full featured receiver for both audio and HT from Sony, and the best part is all this[** only costs a little over $200. **][2]

But what if you need more features and want to spend a little more money for a Sony receiver to get those features? The Sony mentioned above might be the best budget receiver from Sony, but it may not be the best overall deal. Sometimes, it&#8217;s best to spend a bit more money on a Sony receiver.

# Sony STRDH830 Sony 3D 7.1 Channel A/V Receiver

This Sony [**will cost you a bit more money**][1], double in fact compared to the cheaper STRDH5220 above, but you get one important feature that I think every receiver for 2012 should have, and that&#8217;s iPod connectivity. The Apple iPod has become the defacto standard when it comes to portable music, but when you&#8217;re at home or office you want to listen to something with a little more oooph, and the Sony receiver above offers that in spades and will sound much better than the Apple earbuds that came with your Apple iPod.

The best part? This Sony receiver even includes an Apple iPod dock, unlike some other brands that force you to buy an iPod dock for your stereo or home theater receiver separately. This is the perfect marriage between the two biggest electronics companies in the world today.

Besides the fact that you can use the iPod with this receiver, the Sony STRDH830 also offers more power (140 watts, instead of 100 watts), another HDMI input (5 vs 4), the ability to upscale analog video to 1080i, an advanced on-screen digital display, Digital audio calibration for perfect sound from all your speakers, and Bravia sync so you only need one remote control when used in conjunction with your Sony Bravia HDTV.

Overall, I think that this is the much better value receiver from the two. Yes, you pay more up front, but the higher end Sony includes an iPod dock, and connectivity options, and I know for me, that&#8217;s worth much much more than the minimal increase in cost.
