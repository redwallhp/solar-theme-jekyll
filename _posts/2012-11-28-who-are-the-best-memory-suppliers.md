When buying memory online there&#8217;s a few things to consider before you place your online memory order and they are:

  * **RAM Type **Laptop or Desktop memory?
  * **Budget **How much can you afford?
  * **Brand Name or Generic **Do you need affordable memory or can you pay a little more for brand name?
  * **Store Reputation **There&#8217;s more than one memory store I would not recommend at all.
  * **Shipping Cost **Some offer free shipping and others don&#8217;t.
  * **Shipping Speed **How fast do you need your memory
  * **Stock.** Does the memory store stock the ram you need
  * **Easy to Find.** Some online memory stores make it impossible to find anything
  * **Reviews **What do others think about the store ([reseller ratings is a great resource][1])
  * **Warranty** What if something goes wrong with your memory
