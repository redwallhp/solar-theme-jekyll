Everymac.com has compiled a great article on the [differences between the two latest Apple iPhones for 2015:][1]

> It would be easy to take a look at the larger iPhone 6s Plus and smaller iPhone 6s side-by-side and conclude that size is the differentiating factor. Although there is some truth to this general observation, there are other important differences that are not so obvious.

If you&#8217;re looking to compare the two models this site looks at the differences between camera, battery life, screens and even identification differences so you can tell the 2 apart this is the resource you need.
