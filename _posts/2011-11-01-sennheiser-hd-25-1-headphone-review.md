    I have owned these Sennheiser headphones for more than five years now, but only recently have they seen any real great use from me but I thought hey, I may as well write a quick review on these as they have withstood the test of  time, and  as I see when I check prices for Sennheiser headphones, <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TDZOXG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000TDZOXG">they sure have come down in price too</a></strong>.
    
    <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TDZOXG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000TDZOXG"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4291" title="sennheiser hd-25 review" alt="best price on HD-25's" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/JIM_33701-600x398.jpg" width="600" height="398" /></a>
    
    <em>The HD-25' are  a pretty sweet sounding headphone for the money. </em>
    
    When I first bought these, I paid way more money than what you can get these great headphones for now, as I paid over $400 and now with a bit of shopping for some of the better deals on headphones you can get  a much better price.
    
    These are closed back headphones, and except for using apple earbuds or my favorite earbud headphones - the <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004RE5ZCI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004RE5ZCI">Sony MDR EX 310LP</a>, </strong>so I can't compare how they sound  to  open backed headphones like the HD600 or HD650, but I can guess the sound signature would be similar across the sennheiser line for 2012.
    
    <strong>How Do They Sound?</strong>
    
    Oh, boy. Reviewing audio equipment is much trickier than say <a href="http://www.dcresource.com">digital camera reviews </a>where you can take photos and  compare. the output.
    
    Audio is so subjective anyway. My wife loves bass and top 40 hits, while to my brother in law prefers more treble. So, unlike audio magazines I won't  glow about these phones and  how they changed my life with their detailed highs and deep bass because everybody has a preference.  To me, they sound pretty good. I can wear them for hours without fatigue and they have no problem with music from a high end  audio rig or just an iPod or iPad.

    Truth be told, I'm not an expert  on music , but I know what I like and these little senny's  are really  a good headphone and  though I  haven't heard the beats line of products from Monster, I could hazard a good guess that these would offer much more value.
    
    <strong>Not Noise Canceling, But Close</strong>
    
    One of the reasons these little headphones are so good is due to their design. The closed back means you don't have a lot of sound leakage when wearing these  - either noise going out or in, and this allows you to immerse yourself  in what's important and that's the music. I never got the idea of noise canceling  headphones that tended to add noise instead of just blocking  out the outside noise in the first place.
    
    But you're not entirely shut off from the world when listening to these headphones, meaning you can still be aware  of  your surroundings. Perhaps due to lifestyle mostly (I'm an old guy and stay inside)  I tend to use these in and ar0und  the house as opposed to using  them  as street headphones. On the rare occasions I do need headphones outside, I tend to use the Sony earbuds.
    
    <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/JIM_3369.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4288" title="Sennheiser headphones on sale" alt="Beats or Sennheiser?" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/JIM_3369-600x398.jpg" width="600" height="398" /></a>
    
    <em>The senny's are detailed and offer a realistic and  neutral sound that doesn't flavor the recordings </em>
    
    <strong>Comfortable Headphones </strong>
    
    I have two confessions to make when it coms to these headphones - the very first was that at first they were the most uncomfortable phones I have ever used, but then I realized two things: I have a pretty big head which isn't helping matters any and the second thing is  that  I didn't  realize until very recently that you could seperate the headband for a better fit. This is one of those times that reading the manual would  help. I found that by leaving the headphones over the back of my couch for a few hours fixed the problem of the headphones being too tight.
    
    Also, because I wear glasses - the phones are on hear headphones  and not over the ear, so there's pressure on your ears which in turn was pressing on the arms of my glasses and that was uncomfortable to say the least. If I adjust the glasses on my head so there's less pressure on the glasses frames I fare much better and can listen for a few hours every listening  session.

    <strong>Summary </strong>
    
    These are lightweight headphones at just over 5 oz, so I find them to be light, comfortable, and precise and neutral when it comes to sound, that I like. I've never had to, but you can replace the earpads and replace the cable with an audiophile cable if you wan't  to customize the HD-25's further.  If there's one qualm I do have is that the cable connection to the  phones can get loose and I'm down to just one channel instead of stereo headphone listening. A wiggle  of the red connector fixes this with ease and this does not happen often enough to be a problem .
    
    <strong>Where To Buy Sennheiser HD 25  for  the Lowest Price.</strong>
    
    I have found that despite shopping elsewhere <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TDZOXG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000TDZOXG">Amazon is the best price on these headphones</a> </strong>than any other store and they're now on sale for much less.

    I have owned these Sennheiser headphones for more than five years now, but only recently have they seen any real great use from me but I thought hey, I may as well write a quick review on these as they have withstood the test of  time, and  as I see when I check prices for Sennheiser headphones, <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TDZOXG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000TDZOXG">they sure have come down in price too</a></strong>.
    
    <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TDZOXG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000TDZOXG"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4291" title="sennheiser hd-25 review" alt="best price on HD-25's" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/JIM_33701-600x398.jpg" width="600" height="398" /></a>
    
    <em>The HD-25' are  a pretty sweet sounding headphone for the money. </em>
    
    When I first bought these, I paid way more money than what you can get these great headphones for now, as I paid over $400 and now with a bit of shopping for some of the better deals on headphones you can get  a much better price.
    
    These are closed back headphones, and except for using apple earbuds or my favorite earbud headphones - the <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004RE5ZCI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004RE5ZCI">Sony MDR EX 310LP</a>, </strong>so I can't compare how they sound  to  open backed headphones like the HD600 or HD650, but I can guess the sound signature would be similar across the sennheiser line for 2012.
    
    <strong>How Do They Sound?</strong>
    
    Oh, boy. Reviewing audio equipment is much trickier than say <a href="http://www.dcresource.com">digital camera reviews </a>where you can take photos and  compare. the output.
    
    Audio is so subjective anyway. My wife loves bass and top 40 hits, while to my brother in law prefers more treble. So, unlike audio magazines I won't  glow about these phones and  how they changed my life with their detailed highs and deep bass because everybody has a preference.  To me, they sound pretty good. I can wear them for hours without fatigue and they have no problem with music from a high end  audio rig or just an iPod or iPad.
    
    &nbsp;
    
    <img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4290" title="Sennheiser HD 25-1" alt="cheap sennheiser HD 25-1" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/JIM_3371-600x398.jpg" width="600" height="398" />
    
    Truth be told, I'm not an expert  on music , but I know what I like and these little senny's  are really  a good headphone and  though I  haven't heard the beats line of products from Monster, I could hazard a good guess that these would offer much more value.
    
    <strong>Not Noise Canceling, But Close</strong>
    
    One of the reasons these little headphones are so good is due to their design. The closed back means you don't have a lot of sound leakage when wearing these  - either noise going out or in, and this allows you to immerse yourself  in what's important and that's the music. I never got the idea of noise canceling  headphones that tended to add noise instead of just blocking  out the outside noise in the first place.
    
    But you're not entirely shut off from the world when listening to these headphones, meaning you can still be aware  of  your surroundings. Perhaps due to lifestyle mostly (I'm an old guy and stay inside)  I tend to use these in and ar0und  the house as opposed to using  them  as street headphones. On the rare occasions I do need headphones outside, I tend to use the Sony earbuds.
    
    <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/JIM_3369.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4288" title="Sennheiser headphones on sale" alt="Beats or Sennheiser?" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/JIM_3369-600x398.jpg" width="600" height="398" /></a>
    
    <em>The senny's are detailed and offer a realistic and  neutral sound that doesn't flavor the recordings </em>
    
    <strong>Comfortable Headphones </strong>
    
    I have two confessions to make when it coms to these headphones - the very first was that at first they were the most uncomfortable phones I have ever used, but then I realized two things: I have a pretty big head which isn't helping matters any and the second thing is  that  I didn't  realize until very recently that you could seperate the headband for a better fit. This is one of those times that reading the manual would  help. I found that by leaving the headphones over the back of my couch for a few hours fixed the problem of the headphones being too tight.
    
    Also, because I wear glasses - the phones are on hear headphones  and not over the ear, so there's pressure on your ears which in turn was pressing on the arms of my glasses and that was uncomfortable to say the least. If I adjust the glasses on my head so there's less pressure on the glasses frames I fare much better and can listen for a few hours every listening  session.

" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/JIM_3368-600x398.jpg" width="600" height="398" /></a>
    
    <strong>Summary </strong>
    
    These are lightweight headphones at just over 5 oz, so I find them to be light, comfortable, and precise and neutral when it comes to sound, that I like. I've never had to, but you can replace the earpads and replace the cable with an audiophile cable if you wan't  to customize the HD-25's further.  If there's one qualm I do have is that the cable connection to the  phones can get loose and I'm down to just one channel instead of stereo headphone listening. A wiggle  of the red connector fixes this with ease and this does not happen often enough to be a problem .
    
    <strong>Where To Buy Sennheiser HD 25  for  the Lowest Price.</strong>
    
    I have found that despite shopping elsewhere <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TDZOXG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000TDZOXG">Amazon is the best price on these headphones</a> </strong>than any other store and they're now on sale for much less.

    Audio is so subjective anyway. My wife loves bass and top 40 hits, while to my brother in law prefers more treble. So, unlike audio magazines I won't  glow about these phones and  how they changed my life with their detailed highs and deep bass because everybody has a preference.  To me, they sound pretty good. I can wear them for hours without fatigue and they have no problem with music from a high end  audio rig or just an iPod or iPad.

    Truth be told, I'm not an expert  on music , but I know what I like and these little senny's  are really  a good headphone and  though I  haven't heard the beats line of products from Monster, I could hazard a good guess that these would offer much more value.
    
    <strong>Not Noise Canceling, But Close</strong>
    
    One of the reasons these little headphones are so good is due to their design. The closed back means you don't have a lot of sound leakage when wearing these  - either noise going out or in, and this allows you to immerse yourself  in what's important and that's the music. I never got the idea of noise canceling  headphones that tended to add noise instead of just blocking  out the outside noise in the first place.
    
    But you're not entirely shut off from the world when listening to these headphones, meaning you can still be aware  of  your surroundings. Perhaps due to lifestyle mostly (I'm an old guy and stay inside)  I tend to use these in and ar0und  the house as opposed to using  them  as street headphones. On the rare occasions I do need headphones outside, I tend to use the Sony earbuds.

    <strong>Comfortable Headphones </strong>
    
    I have two confessions to make when it coms to these headphones - the very first was that at first they were the most uncomfortable phones I have ever used, but then I realized two things: I have a pretty big head which isn't helping matters any and the second thing is  that  I didn't  realize until very recently that you could seperate the headband for a better fit. This is one of those times that reading the manual would  help. I found that by leaving the headphones over the back of my couch for a few hours fixed the problem of the headphones being too tight.
    
    Also, because I wear glasses - the phones are on hear headphones  and not over the ear, so there's pressure on your ears which in turn was pressing on the arms of my glasses and that was uncomfortable to say the least. If I adjust the glasses on my head so there's less pressure on the glasses frames I fare much better and can listen for a few hours every listening  session.

    <strong>Summary </strong>
    
    These are lightweight headphones at just over 5 oz, so I find them to be light, comfortable, and precise and neutral when it comes to sound, that I like. I've never had to, but you can replace the earpads and replace the cable with an audiophile cable if you wan't  to customize the HD-25's further.  If there's one qualm I do have is that the cable connection to the  phones can get loose and I'm down to just one channel instead of stereo headphone listening. A wiggle  of the red connector fixes this with ease and this does not happen often enough to be a problem .

I have owned these Sennheiser headphones for more than five years now, but only recently have they seen any real great use from me but I thought hey, I may as well write a quick review on these as they have withstood the test of  time, and  as I see when I check prices for Sennheiser headphones, **[they sure have come down in price too][1]**.

[<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4291" title="sennheiser hd-25 review" alt="best price on HD-25's" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/JIM_33701-600x398.jpg" width="600" height="398" />][1]

*The HD-25&#8242; are  a pretty sweet sounding headphone for the money. *

When I first bought these, I paid way more money than what you can get these great headphones for now, as I paid over $400 and now with a bit of shopping for some of the better deals on headphones you can get  a much better price.

These are closed back headphones, and except for using apple earbuds or my favorite earbud headphones &#8211; the **[Sony MDR EX 310LP][2], **so I can&#8217;t compare how they sound  to  open backed headphones like the HD600 or HD650, but I can guess the sound signature would be similar across the sennheiser line for 2012.

**How Do They Sound?**

Oh, boy. Reviewing audio equipment is much trickier than say [digital camera reviews ][3]where you can take photos and  compare. the output.

So, unlike audio magazines I won&#8217;t  glow about these phones and  how they changed my life with their detailed highs and deep bass because everybody has a preference.  To me, they sound pretty good.
