I miss the older Macs at times and System Folder is a lot of fun

> In this weblog I talk about my personal experience with vintage Macs and what I still do with my machines. I also try to collect useful information about classic hardware and software, republishing old articles and tips, mainly taken from 10-15 year-old magazines.
