**Best iMac Memory**

Almost all memory stores online offer something that&#8217;s called a memory configurator which  is  really just a way to search for  the correct ram upgrade for your Mac. You do need to be aware that some memory stores sell memory upgrades for Apple by individual memory chip, while others market their memory upgrades a bit better and sell memory upgrade kits, something that in 2011 is required as I recommend you buy RAM in matched pairs regardless of whether it&#8217;s technically required or not.  With the fact that RAM is the cheapest it&#8217;s been, well, ever  &#8211; it makes no sense to me not to buy RAM that matches.The [Best Mac Memory][1] is sold by so many memory stores it&#8217;s hard to keep track of [memory stores][2], let alone where to get the [best memory prices][3] (I&#8217;ll come back to that in a minute or two) but first we need to determine what Apple Mac you specifically need to upgrade with RAM, as all memory does not work or is compatible with all Apple computers in 2011 so it&#8217;s a good idea to figure out what memory  you need to buy.  
**Cheapest Apple iMac  
**  
The Apple iMac comes in four different models: two Apple iMacs offer 21 inch LCD displays, while the other 2 feature 27 inch displays.  On the 21 inch iMac, processor speeds can start at 3.06GHz Intel Core i3, and then work upwards to 3.2GGzh and  3.2GHz Intel Core i3 while the 27 inch iMacs offer processor speeds of 3.2 GHz Intel Core i3 and lastly a quad core 2.8GHz Intel Core i5 processor being the fastest iMac you can buy today.

But regardless of what specific Apple iMac you choose to buy, they all require the same memory upgrades: 1333GHz DDR3 SDRAM so-dimms are on sale at the lowest prices from a variety of online memory stores and the best iMac RAM Prices are here:

**Best Mac Mini Memory**  
[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1531" title="Apple's Best Selling Desktop" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-28-at-12.34.40-PM.png" alt="Best Selling Desktop Computer" width="285" height="205" />][4]  
**[Best Price on Apple Mac Mini][4]  
**  
The Apple Mac Mini only ships in one model, (well, OK, there&#8217;s the Mac Mini Server) but for the rest of us that want to upgrade the cheapest co  
mputer Apple sells than the standard Mac Mini, it is. The Mac Mini requires slower RAM than the Apple iMac and uses DDR3 1066 SDRAM so-dimms available from a variety of vendors, but again it&#8217;s recommended to buy Mac Min RAM in matched pairs by me. Mac Mini RAM is so cheap it&#8217;s not advisable to mix and match RAM for the Mac Mini and suffer the performance problems that may occur as a result. The Apple Mac Mini only ships with a mere 2GB of RAM, so an upgrade to 8GB for Mac Mini is recommended

The cheapest Mac Mini RAM prices can be found here:

[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1534" title="Best Price MacBook" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-28-at-12.58.24-PM.png" alt="Cheapest MacBook Today" width="301" height="228" />][5]

**<a>Cheapest Apple MacBook</a>  
**  
The MacBook from Apple is limited to only one MacBook model on sale currently- the 2.4GHz MacBook Intel Core 2 Duo, which ships with 2GB of RAM installed in the two MacBook memory upgrade slots available. The maximum MacBook RAM allowed on the 2011 MacBook is 4GB of RAM, which means you can, and I suggest you do, double your MacBook RAM. Like the other Mac models, I do suggest you replace the RAM in pairs, although technically you don&#8217;t have to, there&#8217;s very little performance increase in 3GB of RAM over 2 GB so you are much better off with upgrading all the way to 4GB of RAM for MacBook Pro.

MacBook Pro RAM is super cheap for DDR3 SDRAM 1066 so-dimms, the RAM you need to buy for the MacBook so even if you&#8217;re remotely considering a MacBook Upgrade, I suggest you do it.

**Best Mac Pro Memory **

[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1537" title="Apple Mac Pro" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-28-at-3.30.08-PM.png" alt="Cheapest Mac Pro" width="257" height="260" />][6]

**[Cheapest Apple Mac Pro][6]  
**

The Apple Mac Pro is the professional Mac for those that make their living with an Apple computer and when it comes time to buying memory for this specific Apple Computer Model which more than any other Macs available to buy today, as these high powered desktops can accept the most memory out of any other mac available today with 64GB of RAM for Mac Pros for purchase. The Mac Pro comes in a selection of processor speeds, Quad Core 2.8GHz Quad Core Intel Xeon Processor, 8 Core with two Quad Core Intel Xeon Processors and 12 core with two six core Intel Processors and depending on the model of Mac Pro you have, requires either DDR3 1066 SDRAM DIMMS or DDR3 1333 SDRAM DIMMS, with the dual processor Mac Pro systems using the slower DDR3 1066 SDRAM and the 2.66Mhz and 2.93Mhz Mac Pros running the faster RAM at 1333Mhz.

**[Best Selling MacBook Pro][7]**

The Apple MacBook Pro is all new for 2011 and now offers much faster processing power and new RAM upgrade requirements than the older 2010 MacBook Pros. The new MacBook Pro models require DDR3 1333Mhz sodimms to run or be upgraded to 8GB of RAM (and in some cases, 16GB of MacBook Pro RAM) and require the same memory upgrades whether you need to upgrade a 13 inch MacBook Pro or a 15 inch or 17 inch Macbook Pro, the RAM requirements are all the same.
