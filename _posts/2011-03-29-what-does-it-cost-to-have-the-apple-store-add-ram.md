**Too much.**

Apple MacBook Pro Memory Upgrades for much less than Apple charges:

That&#8217;s what it costs for the **Apple Store to add ram to your Mac **as not only will you have to **pay more for Apple memory** than what you could buy elsewhere for even name brand RAM, which tends to be on the pricier side of things anyway such as [Kingston Memory][1] or [Crucial memory,][2] but you also have to endure the inconvenience of physically taking your Mac to the Apple Store,  and maybe it&#8217;s just  my bad luck but in the few times I have been to an Apple Store, the stores have always been packed with  people which a great  thing for Apple, as they sell more [iPods][3], [iPads][4] and [Apple Mac Computers][5] but for the Macintosh user who **just wants more ram installed**, regardless of what Mac you wish to upgrade and that&#8217;s to **install the Apple RAM yourself** and save money on memory upgrades in the process.

Let&#8217;s use a **13 inch MacBook Pro** as an example, as it currently is the **[best selling notebook][6]** &#8211; regardless of computer manufacturer, so there&#8217;s definitely a market not only for this article, but for cheap and good MacBook Pro RAM overall that&#8217;s much cheaper than what Apple charges for RAM. As I write this to double the RAM on a new MacBook Pro will cost you $400 for 8GB of  13 inch MacBook Pro Memory.

[table id=15 /]

&nbsp;

**[Much Cheaper Apple Memory][7]**

&nbsp;

Compare that to third party memory stores where you can buy the same **[8GB MacBook Pro Memory][8]** for under $100.  I don&#8217;t know about you but I sure don&#8217;t have an extra $300 to spend for the priveledge of **buying ram from Apple** when I can buy pretty much the same memory for less, much less. **75% savings off $400 for MacBook Pro RAM** is nothing to sneeze at, and if I do feel the need to give Apple more money I can do so with the purchase of an **iPod** or even use the savings on Apple RAM towards an **Apple iPad**.

To be fair, the **[cheapest RAM for MacBook Pros][9]**are going to come as **generic RAM,** And although  it&#8217;s not specified there&#8217;s a very good chance your new MacBook Pro will ship with name brand memory upgrades.  The last MacBook I bought had **[Micron RAM ][2]**installed at default, which even though it&#8217;s name brand still only  has a street price of about $100 or perhaps a bit over. You&#8217;ll be fine with RAM from third party memory stores that are established online RAM vendors who sell a **quality generic RAM product**.

Now the best part. You can **install RAM yourself** for any current and discontinued Mac and in the case of the current Macs adding RAM upgrades yourself will not void your Apple limited warranty and [Apple even provides memory upgrade instructions][9] that will help you with the task of a memory install yourself.

I see no reason to either buy RAM from Apple either online, or direct as the cost is very high compared to much **[cheaper Apple Memory upgrade options][7]**
