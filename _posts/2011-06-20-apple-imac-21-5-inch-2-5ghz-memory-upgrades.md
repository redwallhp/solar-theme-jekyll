The Apple iMac 21.5 inch 2.5Ghz model released  in May 2011 is the **[cheapest Apple iMac][1] **you can buy in 2011.

Offering a fast 2.5GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i5 processor with 6MB  of on chip shared L3 cache, a gorgeous 1920&#215;1080 LCD display, 4GB of memory as the factory default Apple iMac memory configuration, 500MB of hard drive space and AMD Radeon HD6750 video card &#8211;  the newest and least expensive iMac aimed at the consumer or  home office or student  user offers a fantastic computing value and ease of use other PC manufacturers  have tried but failed to duplicate but with  fail.

<img class="size-full wp-image-2265 alignnone" title="Apple iMac Deal" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Screen-shot-2011-06-20-at-4.51.17-PM.png" alt="Best iMac Price" width="490" height="397" />

**Video**

New on the 2011 Apple iMac 21.5 inch 2.5Ghz  when compared to later or earlier iMacs is the Facetime HD  web camera and the ability to support an external monitor up to 30 inches and yet still use the iMac display as well, totaling over 50 inches of screen real estate, a perfect match for video editing or working with photography where big screens are needed for at a glance menu and toolbar selection.

**Sound**

When using Apple iTunes or any other compatible video or MP3 player (iTunes ships free with all iMac models) the sound is provided through stereo  17 watt loudspeakers and multiple ports are also inlcluded for both analog and digital audio requirements.

**Connections **

The Apple iMac offers very versatile  connection options  with all connectors placed on the rear of  the 21.5 inch iMac to compliment the clean Apple iMac design and getting unsightly cables hidden out of plain sight. One thunderbolt connector (there&#8217;s 2 thunderbolt connector on every other 2011 Apple iMac so you may want to consider a more expensive iMac if  the thunderbolt  technology is now, or will be important to your computing needs).

The mini display port offers connection options for both VGA and DVI options,  but as the connectors are specific to Apple computers, the iMac accessories can be considered expensive when compared to more standard VGA connections on your standard desktop PC&#8217;s.

One firwire 800 port is included on the iMac, but  over time you will find that as the Thunderbolt technolgy improves that it&#8217;s my guess firewire will not be included on future Apple iMac  models.

**Wireless Keyboard and Mouse**

One  of the nicest features on the new 2011 Apple iMacs is the fact that using the included bluetooth technology you&#8217;re now free of wires when using the the cheap iMac and this fact makes the  cheap iMac a much more attractive solution for home computing as some kitchens now include a little nook or small desk for a TV or computer and the iMac would make a very attractive wire-free computer for home use.

**Size and Weight**

Height: 17.75 inches (45.1 cm)  
Width: 20.8 inches (52.8 cm)  
Depth: 7.42 inches (18.85 cm)  
Weight: 20.5 pounds (9.3 kg)3

At 20lbs, the Apple iMac 21.5 inch is not light and in no way match a ultra portable computer such as the MacBook Air, but thanks to it&#8217;s sleek design with cable free technology you could move it simply and easily if you needed periodically move the Apple iMac.

**Warranty**  
This iMac model, like all Apple computers, comes standard with 90 days of telephone support to get you up and running with your new iMac and a one year limited warranty is included with the Apple iMac too. There is an extended warranty you can buy for the iMac, but as the iMac is not a portable in any sense of the word, I don&#8217;t think an extended warranty is really needed for this affordable Apple desktop. At just over $1000 for the computer itself, it makes no sense to add another cost to the AppleCare warranty which even on sale costs over $100, and unless you use the iMac in some extremely dirty or dusty environments I feel it&#8217;s better to save the $150 and apply it to more memory upgrades.

**Apple iMac 21.5 inch 2.5GHz Memory Upgrades  
**

The Apple iMac 21.5 inch 2.5Ghz model is the only model in the 2011 Apple lineup that only allows for a 8GB RAM maximum and all other faster iMacs (and more expensive too) wil accept 16GB of iMac DDR3 1333Mhz RAM. The good news is if you&#8217;re upgrading from the 2010 Apple iMac lineup, you can use and swap out the RAM from your old iMac to new.

If you&#8217;re buying an iMac 21.5 inch 2.5GHz, you need to add more iMac RAM to the cheapest iMac in Apple&#8217;s iMac lineup. From the factory, this sleek consumer Mac ships with 4GB of RAM (2x2GB sdram dimms), but you should double the RAM to 8GB for maximum performance. Not too long ago, 8GB of iMac RAM would cost you as much as the computer itself, but ove time iMac RAM prices have really dropped and you now can fill this affordable iMac with all the RAM it can handle for the cost of a dinner and a movie.

You could do just fine with running 4GB of iMac RAM, and for some of you 4GB might be all the RAM you need, but as we enter the second half of the year, 8GB of RAM is so cheap for this computer it really is very good money spent on your computer, and in some instances better than adding more hard drive space to your iMac (you should have an external hard drive for backup) or even buying software as a lot of software you can get for free or work &#8216;in the cloud&#8217; where you don&#8217;t really need an application on your iMac above and beyond what&#8217;s included with the iMac at the store, such as iTunes and iPhoto, programs that allow you to organize your photos and music on your iMac.
