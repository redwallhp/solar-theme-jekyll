I think I may have found my favorite to to list app to date:

I have tried some other popular to-do list programs like wunderlist, todoist and todo.txt, but I really like the outline format for getting stuff out of my head and into a workable to-do list. It works on every computer or device I have so I always have access to my to-do list regardless of mobile or desktop device.
