This looks neat:

 [eero - Finally, WiFi that works](https://eero.com/)


> eero is the world’s first home WiFi system. A set of three eeros covers the typical home. They work in perfect unison to deliver hyper-fast, super-stable WiFi to every square foot of your house. It’s simple to set up. Easy to manage. And gets better over time with new features and improved performance. Stream video, get work done, or swipe right in any room — not just next to your router. Finally. WiFi that actually works.


I wonder what it would be like to be able to get wi-fi in the kitchen behind the fridge?

They are a bit pricier than the typical $100 router, but they look easier to setup and use too.
