One of, if not the favorite companies I have come across in my efforts to move to the USA was to switch cellular providers from Rogers in Canada to Verizon in the USA  thanks to the possibility of their Canada Wireless plans that allow me to call both the US and Canada as if it  were one big country.

**About Verizon**

Verizon wireless is a pretty big wireless company and not only offers cellular service nationwide, they recently increased their customer base with the release and addition of the Apple iPhone 4  to compliment  the mostly  
Android based smartphone lineup.

This cellular company is also more than just about wireless products and services, but they also specialize in Cable TV,  Internet and landline phones for your  home or home office, and their business services cater to tools and services for all a business needs in 2012.

How are they able to grow and afford to offer all these products and services? Verizon is a public company with stocks traded on the stock market, which means either big gains in income or losses depending on the day or even time. How to you keep track of the stock prices? By checking what Verizon is currently being traded at

**Verizon Stock Checking **

Verizon&#8217;s stock symbol on the NYSE is **VZ, **a nice and short name that&#8217;s easy to remember. I have never bought or sold  stock in my life, so I will not lead you astray with my advice, but instead offer a few sites where you can check Verizon stock quotes (usually with a delay, and not real time stock prices for Verizon) and learn more about this publicly traded communications company.

[Yahoo Finance Verizon Stock Quotes ][1]

[Morningstar Verizon Stock Quotes][2]

[Marketwatch Verizon Stock Quotes][3]

[MSN Verizon Stock Quotes][4]

Above are some websites you can refer to when checking stock prices at Verizon.
