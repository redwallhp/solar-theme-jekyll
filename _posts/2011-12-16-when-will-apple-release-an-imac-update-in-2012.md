I wonder, is this the end of the Apple iMac?  I hope not, as the Apple iMac is one of the best selling desktop computers in the past from Apple, but with the release of the iPad, new MacBook Pro&#8217;s rumored to be released soon, and the fact that lightweight ultrabooks and even smartphones are more popular than ever before I wonder how, and more importantly when Apple will release new Apple iMac computers in 2012?

<img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3877" title="Cheap iMac 27 inch " src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/imac-27-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" />

The current**[ 2011 Apple iMac models][1]** saw a release date back in May, meaning as we enter a new year, the once new iMac isn&#8217;t so high tech anymore and I am hoping for the 2012 iMac to  be released with the following features:

1. **Touch Screen iMac** . The iPad has touch input, and so does the iPhone, so  why not the 2012 iMac?  I wonder how much  of a feature this would be used on a desktop computer? Would it be beneficial to be able to use a touch screen iMac for the everyman? (and woman). One thing I think that would be beneficial for a touch screen iMac would be for shopping and scrolling, and I bet the graphics community would love to be able to use a finger instead of a mouse.

2. **More Memory**. The ram on the iMac for 2011 is already at a respectable 16GB, but I predict that by the end of the yea 16GB for iMac willl be the norm, and  32GB would allow for future expandability.

3. **Faster Processors**. The iMac could replace the Mac Pro entirely if the processor speed, ram and hard drive specifications would increase. We haven&#8217;t seen a Mac Pro update in ages and in fact, it&#8217;s been so long that I wonder is there will be a brand new Mac Pro at all or will Apple rely on the Pro notebook lineup for all their professional customers.

4. **Flatter screen.** If Apple can make a notebook that only weighs a few pounds, surely they can make the iMac better looking. It&#8217;s still a pretty thin machine, but the current iMac design needs  a refresh.

**5. Bigger Screen **This is another possibility.  With LED prices continuosly dropping, it would make perfect sense for a 32 inch iMac that doubles as a TV. and offers built in TV capabilities &#8211;  something like Google TV where you could  use the iMac as your media center, and not just the hub.

**When  will the 2012 Apple iMac Release Date Be?**

The  last time we saw a completely new iMac design is last May, and I can&#8217;t expect that we will see a new Apple iMac before May 2012. There&#8217;s a very good chance for a brand new MacBook Pro  to be released in 2012. Then  there&#8217;s the iPad and early spring tends to be the time for iPad releases. The iPhone has historically been released in the summertime and then we&#8217;re into the fall for iPod releases or other surprises from Apple for the holiday shopping season. This leaves **May 2012 to be a very good chance to see a new iMac release in 2012 **and would be one year from the release of the 2011 Apple iMac. &#8211; a good time to replace the 2011 Apple iMac with a newer 2012 iMac.
