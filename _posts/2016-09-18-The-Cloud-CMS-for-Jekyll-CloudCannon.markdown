This looks pretty neat if you want to quickly blog with jekyll and want a wysisyg editor simiar to wordpress. I've tried it, but I think I like my current workflow better though


> The best of both worlds
> Developers and non-developers easily collaborate on sites without stepping on each otherâ€™s toes.
> 
> Developers have complete control over the source code and simply build static or Jekyll websites.
> 
> Non-developers update content visually using the CloudCannon inline editor.
