The Apple iMac is Apple&#8217;s **[Best Selling Apple Desktop][2]** and has been for years ever since introduced in the now very dated teal color scheme of the 1990&#8217;s with that little and revolutionary at the time, round Apple mouse with just the one button. 

But in 2010, one of the best selling Apple iMac models had been the Apple iMac 3.06GHz model and with the fast dual core 3.06GHz Intel i3 processor that features a 256k level 2 cache, for each core and combines a 4GB system cache for both cores this is still a fast and entirely upgradeable Apple iMac despite the fact that it is now discontinued with faster iMacs released in 2011. 

But just because you have an older 2010 Apple iMac means you need to upgrade the entire computer and you can increase the speed of your 21.5 inch iMac by **buying and adding more memory** instead. 

This particular Apple iMac has a maximum memory allotment of 16GB of iMac Memory, even though Apple ships this iMac with just 4GB of RAM standard. You can quadruple the amount of RAM from 4GB to 16GB with this iMac by removing and replacing the factory installed 4GB configured as two two GB memory modules and replacing the Apple iMac RAM with much bigger 4GB memory modules x 4 to get the maximum benefit 16GB of RAM will provide in the 2010 Apple iMac 3.06GHz. 

**What Memory Do I Buy for the Apple iMac 3.06GHz?**

This 2010 Apple iMac requires the **[purchase of 4GB DDR3 SDRAM SODIMMs running at 1333Mhz][3]**. Unlike some iMacs in the past, this particular iMac part number requires that only DDR3 1333MHz RAM be installed and the chart below shows you the cheapest prices for iMac RAM for both the 2010 and 2011 Apple iMac Models:
