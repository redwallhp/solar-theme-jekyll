Dan Gillmor, [writing for Slate][1] asks this question as he ponders the future of Apple&#8217;s Devices:

> I&#8217;d just purchased was probably my last Mac. Apple, I said, was becoming more and more control-freakish in how it allowed customers to use the hardware they&#8217;d purchased. It seemed clear that the company intended to move its personal computers “into a more iPad/iPhone-like ecosystem, where Apple gives you permission to use the computers you buy in only the ways Apple considers appropriate. 

With the release of Apple&#8217;s new iPad Pro he might be on to something. I know the Mac isn&#8217;t going anywhere tomorrow, but some have already switched to [using their iPads as their primary devices][2] so Dan might be on to something.
