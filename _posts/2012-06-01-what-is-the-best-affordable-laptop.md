As newer computer models change over time, so will this list but I thought I&#8217;d take time to research some cheaper laptops and what&#8217;s currently available on sale. (Of course, you&#8217;ll need to add ram to your laptop). You will note I&#8217;m not  listing the best selling laptops or even the cheapest laptops because I have found that sometimes spending a bit more money is worth it when laptop shopping.

**What is affordable?**

If you want a Mac Laptop you&#8217;re going to need [close to $1000 to play][1], and if you don&#8217;t have that kind of money then you&#8217;re forced to look at a Windows notebook. There was a time that I would loathe to recommend a PC laptop but with Windows 8 on the horizon and a [consumer preview available][2] I may have to change my tune. You can also install [Ubuntu][3] on the Windows PC and with a bit of tweaking you can get a notebook that feels real close to the Mac OS for a fraction of the price.

**Laptops Under $400**

I&#8217;ve already written about $400 laptops and there&#8217;s lots to choose from. Three current  best sellers are:



The Acer Aspire AS5750Z-4835 is one notebook worth a look and offers all the basics of a cheap notebook in a 15.6 inch package with 4GB RAM, 500GB hard drive and a 15.6 inch display.



The Asus A53U-EH11 is another cheap laptop that&#8217;s feature packed with and AMD dual core processor, 3GB of RAM and a 320GB hard drive and at under $350.00, this is one of the cheapest notebooks you can buy today.



Don&#8217;t discount a chromebook either. The Samsung series 5 chromebook is an option as there&#8217;s less hassle with OS stuff and viruses. If you live in a web browser, this could be the perfect notebook for you.

**Laptops $500 to $1000**

If screen real estate is what you need the HP g7-1310us is a hard deal to beat for a 17 inch notebook, especially for the price of just over $500.



If the thought of lugging around a big screen notebook all day brings shivers up your spine, check out the Dell Inspiron i14RN-1227BK. At just under $500 this 14 inch beauty shaves weight off the traditional laptop and is cheaper than an Ultrabook.



And speaking of Ultrabooks, now that they are dropping in price, they are a much cheaper alternative to an Apple offering and are the cheapest and are the best laptops and notebooks you can buy today.



These notebooks are just a taste of what&#8217;s available when shopping for a laptop and all I would consider affordable laptops.
