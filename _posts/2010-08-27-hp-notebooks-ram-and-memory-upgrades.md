[HP notebooks][1] keep getting cheaper and cheaper over time and they&#8217;re a great deal when you buy them for certain but you can do better and get more performance from the HP notebooks by just doing one thing that&#8217;s cheap and easy to do: add more memory or ram to HP Notebooks. You only need a philips screwdriver and a clear workspace that&#8217;s free from static electricity and you can install ram for HP notebooks yourself you don&#8217;t need to hire any computer shop or geeks to install the notebook ram yourself.

[table id=15 /]There&#8217;s a good chance your memory upgrades for your new HP notebook require DDR3 1333Mhz RAM, especially if your processor is Intel i3, i5 or i7 which are popular processor for HP computers in 2011. Below are the current ram prices available for HP notebooks:

But first you need to buy the RAM for your HP notebook and here&#8217;s something I&#8217;ll share in my 13 years or working with ram and memory: you can buy ram from third party memory stores or memory manufacturers that&#8217;s just as good but this HP memory offers one thing that buying directly from HP can&#8217;t match: RAM is cheaper when you buy it from trusted memory shops and stores. Don&#8217;t pay too much for RAM or Memory for your HP notebook. Let&#8217;s take a look at the currrent HP notebook lineup and I&#8217;ll tell you what RAM you need, and where you can get the best deal on HP Memory too.

**HP Mini 110 PC-series RAM and Memory Upgrades**

The HP Mini 110 1100 series is a wee little netbook that&#8217;s a cheap way to get into portable computing and is more than enough but it doesn&#8217;t come with enough RAM to run any applications really. It can be upgraded to more RAM by replacing the 1GB of RAM with a 2gb PC2 DDR2 6400 sdram sodimm which will allow your Mini PC from HP to run faster.

**HP Mini 210 PC series Memory and RAM upgrades**

The Mini 210 is yet another netbook from HP that comes in a few different configurations but there&#8217;s two things that are standard across the HP Mini 210 series, and that&#8217;s the fact that you can replace the 1GB DDR RAM and add a bigger 2GB DDR memory module for the HP Mini 210 PC series.

**HP Mini 310 PC series Memory and RAM upgrades**

The maximum memory for the 310 series netbooks from HP is 3gb of RAM  and to get to the maximum RAM you have to add to the 1gb that comes from the factory and is non removeable ram and buy 2gb ram for the 310 Mini series from HP to give you a maximum of 3GB RAM by installing 2gb DDR3 SDRAM sodimms.

**HP Pavilion G42-200 series notbook RAM and Memory upgrades**

The HP Pavilion G42-200xx series of notebook computer offers two memory upgrade slots that will accept and take  DDR3 PC1066 SDRAM sodimms and you can install two 4gB ddr3 sdram sodimms to get to the maximum memory for the HP Pavilion G42-200 of 8GB of RAM which is much much better than the 4GB of RAM that comes standard on this notebook computer from HP

**HP Pavilion G61-400 series notebook RAM and Memory Upgrades**

The HP Pavilion G61-400 series of notebooks comes in many different configurations so depending on your exact model number you may be able to expand your HP Pavilion G61 400 series RAM to either 4GB or 8gB of Maximum RAM. This HP pavilion ships with 3gb of RAM standard so I suggest replacing the smaller 1GB ram chip in one memory upgrade slot and buying a 2gb ram module for the HP Pavilion G61-400 notebook series. If you have model that can accept 8GB of RAM then pull the 3gb out of there and install two 4gb ram modules to max out this particular HP Pavilion G61-400 series.

**  
****HP Pavilion G61-600 series notebook RAM and Memory Upgrades**

The HP Pavilion G61-600 series ships standard with  3gb of DDR2 SDRAM RAM but you can upgrade to 4GB of RAM by replacing the 1GB RAM module with a 2gb ddr2 sdram sodimm for the HP Pavilion G61-600

**HP Pavilion G62-600 series notebook RAM and Memory Upgrades**

The HP Pavilion G62-600 series notebook RAM and Memory Upgrades ships standard with 4gb of DDR3 sdram sodimms in the two memory upgrade slots so you can put 2 x 4gb ddr3 sdram sodimms and max out the  HP Pavilion G62-600 series RAM to the maximum 8GB of RAM allowed for this high performance  HP Pavilion model.

**HP Pavilion G62-200 series laptop memory and Ram Upgrades**

The HP Pavilion G62-200 ships standard with either 3gb or 4gb of RAM  depending on the model and is broken down to the following when considering standard ram configurations:

The G62-220US: 3 GB DDR2 (1 x 1024 MB + 1 x 2048 MB)  
G62-208CA / G62-221CA / G62-220CA / G62-224CA / G62-219CA: 3 GB DDR3 (1 x 1024 MB + 1 x 2048 MB)

G62-237CA / G62-238CA: 4 GB DDR2 (2 x 2048 MB)  
G62-228CA / G62-264CA / G62-244CA / G62-223CA / G62-227CA: 4 GB DDR3 (2 x 2048 MB)

As you can see there&#8217;s two different types of RAM here with the lower end G62-200 models using the slower ddr2 sdram at either 3gb or 4gb of RAM standard but the higher end models use the DDR3 sdram sodimms. The good news is all these models regardless can accept 8GB of RAM as maximum memory, so it&#8217;s a good idea to upgrade to the max of 8gb using 2x4gb ram , either ddr2 or dd3 depending on your specific HP Pavilion notebook model.

**HP Pavilion G72-200 notebook PC series RAM and Memory Upgrades**

The HP Pavilion G72-200 notebook series is another model that uses both DDR2 or DDR3 SDRAM sodimms depending on the specific HP Pavilion G72 series you have. Standard memory for these HP Pavilion Notebooks is as follows:

G72-214CA / G72-217CA: 4 GB DDR2 (2 x 2048 MB)  
G72-260US: 4 GB DDR3 (2 x 2048 MB)

And this HP notebook too offers a maximum memory allowance of 8GB across the board. just be sure to buy the right memory for your specific Pavilion model and then upgrade by buying either 2x4gb DDR2 or DDR3 memory modules.

**HP Envy 13-100 Notebook Series RAM and Memory Upgrades**

The HP Envy 13 series from HP can be maxed out at 5gb of RAM and this is accomplished by supplementing the 1gb of ram that&#8217;s non removeable and on board and adding 1x4gb DDR3 sdram sodimms replacing the standard 2GB memory module.

**HP Envy 14-1000 Notebook series RAM and Memory Upgrades**

The HP Envy 14 series from HP ships standard with 4GB of RAM and can be maxed out to 2gb of RAM by installing 2x4gb DDR3 sdram sodimms to get a maximum of 8GB of RAM for your new HP Envy 14 series. I suggest you add the maximum HP envy RAM to get  the most out of your HP notebook computer

**HP Envy 15-1000 notebook series RAM and Memory Upgrades**

The HP Envy 15 series notebooks already ship with a healthy  6GB of RAM but you can ADD 16gb of RAM to this HP notebook and it&#8217;s one of the few notebooks that will accept and recognize 16gb of RAM, so I suggest you max out your HP Envy 15 by adding 4x4gb ddr3 sdram pc3-8500 sodimm for blazing fast notebook experience.

**HP Envy 17 -1000 notebook series RAM and Memory Upgrades **

The HP Envy 17 series notebooks can accept up to 8GB of ram by replacing the factory ram and adding 2x4gb ddr3 sdram sodimms to get  to the maximum memory for the HP Envy 17.

**HP HDX series notebook RAM and Memory Upgrades**

The HP and HDX series notebooks come in a few different configurations and the HDX16t model offers a max of 8gb ram allowable by upgrading the two memory slots to 2x4gb of ddr2 pc2 6400 DDR sodimms. The HDX 18t will also accept 8gb of RAM as the maximum memory configuration but depending on what 18t model you have you might need ddr2 or ddr3 pc sdram sodimms. Regardless its the same for each: replace the stock ram and replace it with 2x4gb ram memory modules.

**HP Pavilion dv6-1200 entertainment notebook PC series RAM and Memory Upgrades**

The HP Pavilion dv6-1200 supports up to 8gb of RAM and requires ddr2 pc2 6400 sdram sodimms and the maximum ram of 8gb is achieved by installing 2x4gb into the 2 memory upgrade slots available in this specific notebook computer by HP.

**HP Pavilion dm1-2000 entertainment notebook PC series  RAM and Memory Upgrades**

The HP Pavilion DM1-2000 entertainment notebook PC series RAM and Memory uprades are maxed out at 5gb of RAM which means to get there, you have to replace the factory ram or memory in the one available slot and install and buy a 4gb ddr3 1066 sdram sodimm dimm which will get you to the 5gb max ram for the dm1-2000 from HP

**HP Pavilion DM3-1000 enterntainment notebook PC memory RAM and memory upgrades **

The HP Pavilion DM3-1000 entertainment notebook PC series may or may not be able to upgrade your ram depending on which specific model you have: the DM3-1040US is the only  one that will accept more ram upgrades and it will accept 8gb of RAM by upgrading to 2x4gb ddr3 sdram sodimms.

**HP Pavilion DM3-1100 entertainment notebook PC memory and RAM Upgrades **

What ram you need for the DM3-1100 entertainment notebooks depends on what you&#8217;ve got: The dm3-1100us takes DDR2 memory upgrade sodimms but the dm3-1100ca uses the newer ddr3 sdram sodimms and the ddr3 model is the only model you can buy more memory for: you can install 8gb of RAM into the ddr3 version of the DM3-1100 but you can&#8217;t put any more ram into the DM3-1100 that uses DDR2 ram as it comes from HP with maximum of 4gb of RAM already installed.

**HP Pavilion DM4-1000 notebook PC series RAM and Memory Upgrades **

The HP Pavilion DM4-1000 laptop series ships standard with 4gb of RAM already installed and uses DDR3 sdram sodimms that you&#8217;ll have to pull and  install the 2&#215;2 DDR3 sdram sodimms  and install 4gb ddr sdram sodimms in the two memory upgrade slots HP provides.

**HP Pavilion DV4-1500 entertainment notebook PC series RAM and Memory Upgrades**

The HP Pavilion DV4-1500 series notebooks from HP come standard from the factory with 4gb of ddr3 sdram installed but you can max out this enterntainment PC to 8gb of ram by upgrading the ram to two 4gb sdram ddr3 sodimms and I suggest you do. It&#8217;s easy to upgrade the RAM in your dv4-1500 and you can install the ram yourself.

**HP Pavilion DV4-2100 entertainment notebook PC series RAM and Memory Upgrades **

The HP Pavilion DV4-2100 series uses either ddr2 sdram memory or ddr3 sdram memory depending on what specific model of this series of notebook memory you require. The dv4-2120ca uses ddr2 sdram sodimms and comes standard with 4gb of ram installed and the dv4-2160 requires ddr3 sdram to operate. It comes from HP with 4gb of ram installed but you can max out to 8gb of ram buy buying 4gb DDR3 ram modules x2.

**HP Pavilion DV5-2000 entertainment notebook PC RAM and Memory Upgrades **

**The HP Pavilion DV5-2000 entertainment PC DV5-2000 comes in a few different configurations depending on your needs but the this notebook series from HP all ships with the same 4gb ddr3 sdram  in a 2x2gb configuration.

<table border="0" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="4" bgcolor="#CCCCCC">
  <tr bgcolor="#E7E7E7">
    <td valign="top" width="401">
      dv6-2164ca / dv6-2128ca: 4 GB DDR2 (2 x 2048 MB)<br /> dv6-2140ca: 4 GB DDR2 (2 x 2048 MB) 4GB DDR2 System Memory<br /> dv6-2138ca: 4 GB DDR3 (2 x 2048 MB)<br /> dv6-2130ca / dv6-2150ca: 4 GB DDR3 (2 x 2048 MB) 4GB DDR3 System Memory<br /> dv6-2120ca: 4GB DDR2 System Memory

**HP Pavilion DV6-3000 serieas enterntainment notebook PC RAM and Memory Upgrades**

The HP Paviloon DV6-3000 series of notebook computers is another system that offers a lot of different options and specific part numbers and it&#8217;s easy to get overwhelmed when buying ram but I&#8217;m hoping I can help you get the right ram for your HP Pavilion,whatever the model number.

**HP Pavilion DV7-3000 entertainment notebook PC series RAM and memory upgrades**
