[Sandisk 128GB iXpand SDIX30N-128G Flash Drive USB 3.0 Lightning r20MB/s w5MB/s](https://www.oempcworld.com/OEMPCworld-com/USB128GB-iXpand30.html)

This is kind of a neat product: 
> 128GB Sandisk iXpand USB 3.0 Flash Memory Drive with Lighting connector for iPhone cap design up to 20MB/s Read and 5MB/s Write for Mac and PC 5V self powered Plug and Play- Hot Swappable- external media- portable drive 59mm x 17mm x 13mm
> 

It's got both a USB 3.0 port AND lightning port so you can easily transfer your data from your Mac to iOS device. 

It's kind of pricey though at about $100.00
