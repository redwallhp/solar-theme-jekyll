Mac Prices is one of the fist places to go when looking for deals on Apple Macs and accessories.

>Many price comparison websites use robots to gather pricing information from various vendors. This often leads to inaccurate or outdated prices, or prices for left-over, refurbished, and open-box machines. In addition, you rarely get information on free bundles, rebates, or discounts. As opposed to these sites, we use a real person to update our prices each morning. We visit the reseller's website to see the prices and bundles with our own eyes, and if that fails, we pick up the telephone and give them a call.
