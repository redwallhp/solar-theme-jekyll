Run Ubuntu on your older Power PC Mac:
 
 [Lubuntu 14.04.4 LTS (Trusty Tahr)](http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/lubuntu/releases/trusty/release/)

I have done this on an older PowerBook G4 and it works gerat. It does take a bit to get the wireless card to work, but if you want breathe some old life into an Apple laptop that's now over a decade old this is one solution
