Apple today quietly bumped the standard configuration of the 13 inch MacBook Air to [8GB of RAM](http://www.apple.com/macbook-air/specs.html). Considering that 8GB of RAM is so cheap ([about $30.00](http://amzn.to/1WcNgUd)) this isn't that big of deal when it comes down to it, but it will give the MacBook Air 13 inch a bit more breathing room for applications that need a bit more RAM or for opening more applications.

Considering that the MacBook Air is one of the current Apple computers you **cannot** upgrade the ram on, this is pretty good news regardless and even though the MacBook Air is due for a refresh (or discontinuation) the 13 inch MacBook Air remains one of the best values for an Apple notebook you can buy today, and this 8GB upgrade only makes the 13 inch MacBook Air a better value than the 11 inch model which still only ships with 4GB of RAM in the standard configuration.
