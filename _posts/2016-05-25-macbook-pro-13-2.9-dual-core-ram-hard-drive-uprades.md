The MacBook Pro 13" 2.9GHz dual-core Intel Core i7 can accept up to 16gb of RAM and both spinning hard drives as well much faster SSD drives for increased performance. 

**RAM for MacBook Pro 13" 2.9GHz dual-core Intel Core i7**

This model of MacBook Pro can accept up to 16gb of RAM thanks to the 2 memory slots availabe. 16gb of RAM for this MacBook pro model is super cheap at about $50.00 for a 16gb kit. ([**check price**](http://amzn.to/1ONw3dI))

If don't want to upgrade the MacBook pro to 16gb, there's always an 8gb option that will only cost you about thirty dollars ([**check price**](http://amzn.to/1ONw3dI)) but I suggest that if you're going to to to the bother of upgrading the RAM on this MacBook Pro model that you do it right and just get all the ram installed that is allowed. 

***Spinning (traditional) hard drives for MacBook Pro 13" 2.9GHz dual-core Intel Core i7**

I don't really recommend upgrading to a traditional hard drive on your MacBook Pro unless you really need to carry a lot of files with you at all times and need the storage space. 

The benefits of traditional hard drives vs SSD drives is that the cost per gb is a lot lower when you compard prices of SSD vs HDD in the same capacity. 

If you do prefer to buy a traditional hard drive for the MacBook Pro here's a few suggestions:

## SSD Drives for MacBook Pro 13" 2.9GHz dual-core Intel Core i7

SSD drives a much better choice for upgrading the hard drive on any computer. The main advantage is speed as there are no moving parts to slow down the read and write process so apps open quikly and your entire computer will feel more responsive. 

The disadvantage of SSDs vs hard drives is cost. SSD drives are more expensive per gigabyte than traditional drives but prices continue to drop so more and more can afford a SSD upgrade for Macbook pro.
