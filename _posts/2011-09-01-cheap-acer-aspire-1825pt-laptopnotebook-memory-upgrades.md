**[Best 8GB RAM upgrade for Acer Aspire 1825PT. ][2]**

The Acer Aspire 1825PT notebook is a 14 inch Acer notebook released in May 2010 and offers a P250 processor running at 2.3GHz with 3GB of RAM installed from the factory with a 320GB hard drive and runs windows 7 as the default operating system. With a sale price in the $500 area this notebook from Acer is a competitive notebook for the price and one of many notebooks available for sale if you&#8217;re in the market to buy a new Acer notebook. 

**Acer Aspire 1825PT Memory Upgrades**

This is a relatively new Acer notebook that requires the use of DDR3 1066 SDRAM sodimms and this particular Acer notebook offers two memory upgrade slots and can be upgraded to 8GB by replacing the factory Acer RAM with two 4GB sdram sodimms. An **[8GB Acer memory upgrade][2]** is the cheapest price I have seen in the fifteen years I have been monitoring ram prices and 8GB should cost you less than $50 for 8GB of Acer RAM. This is one of the better deals on RAM upgrades for Acer notebook computers today. 

**How To Upgrade Acer Aspire 1825PT  
**

Like most Acer notebooks access to the ram upgrades are accessible via a small door or compartment on the bottom of the Acer Aspire 1825. Once you have the notebook batter removed, you can safely remove the door, revealing the ram upgrade slots on your Acer notebook.

Remove the Acer factory RAM upgrades by pulling back the two small tabs that hold the ram upgrades in place and gently pull on the memory module to remove the acer factory memory upgrade. Once both Acer Aspire 1825 memory upgrade slots are free, all you need to do is to reverse this process by adding 2x4GB DDR3 SDRAM sodimms to maximize both the Acer Aspire 1825 Memory and also Performance. You should find that after completing the ram upgrade your Acer notebook will run faster and smoother with the added 8GB of RAM.
