**Apple MacBook Pro 2.3GHz Intel Core i5 13 inch  
**

Apple has long set a standard of regular updates to their computer model lines—often at intervals of just a few months.  The MacBook Pro line, however, had, until the introduction in early 2011 of the Apple MacBook Pro 2.3GHz Intel Core i5 13 inch (and its 15 and 17 inch siblings), gone almost a year without updating this product line.

The wait turned out to be well worth it, however, as the Apple MacBook Pro 2.3GHz Intel Core i5 13 inch as the improvements included upgrades to processors, brand new graphic processors, as well as a new peripheral connector.

Starting at a price of $1199 13-inch model featured a 2.3GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor and a 5400-rpm 320GB hard drive.  The i5 was one of Intel’s latest generation of the Core series of processors, also referred to as “Sandy bridge”.  Processor, cache, integrated graphics and memory controller all reside on the same die in the Sandy Bridge configuration, and also now feature the HD Graphics 3000 integrated graphics processor, which had only  previously been available in higher end Apple models. In ratings published in the magazine PC World, the 13 inch MacBook Pro i5 was rated 41 to 57 percent faster than the previous MacBook generation.
