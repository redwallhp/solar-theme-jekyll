I don&#8217;t know why, but next to some pretty shady memory stores (that I don&#8217;t list), the next area where you can get into trouble when shopping online is when you buy a digital camera.

[**The Nikon D5100 is the best selling digital camera**][1]

[<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4739" title="Nikon D5100 deal" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Screen-Shot-2012-05-31-at-8.42.17-AM.png" alt="Best Selling Digital Camera" width="310" height="304" />][1]

You want to be sure you&#8217;re buying a camera that comes in the original box, with all the accessories and packaging too and most important  of all, the warranty card.

You know the saying about how if the price is too good to be true, it is. Well, this applies to camera buying as well and especially with the warranties missing from some camera manufacturers you need to certain that the camera you buy will be supported, especially when you buy a digital SLR camera that tends to be pretty expensive, and why when you shop online for digital slr&#8217;s the prices you see from some online vendors can sure be enticing.

But in the long term, they&#8217;re not. Some sellers will sell you just the camera body and take out all the accessories, and some online stores try to sell you gray market cameras. These are cameras that were manufactured for one market, but end up being sold in another. An example  would be the [Nikon D800 ][2]&#8211;  a very popular and very expensive digital SLR on sale right now, and a perfect candidate for a grey market SLR.

You want to ensure the Nikon D800 (or any camera you buy) is manufactured for market intended. Differences may be slight or not at all, but if you buy a grey market camera it will not have any warranty. In my case, I want Nikon USA to support my Nikon SLR in the case there&#8217;s a problem with the camera.

It&#8217;s pretty easy to buy a camera online safely. Buy from trusted vendors you have heard of. If Jim&#8217;s Camera  store is offering a too good to be true discount on the camera &#8211; guess what? it really is  too good to be true.

I have found that when buying cameras online, **[Amazon][3]**  continues to offer the best selling cameras at the best  prices and you can be sure you are buying a camera with all the accessories and warranty support you need.
