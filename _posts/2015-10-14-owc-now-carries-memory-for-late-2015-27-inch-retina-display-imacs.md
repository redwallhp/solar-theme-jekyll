OWC is the first memory vendor I have found to date to carry the [1866MHZ ram upgrades you need ][1]to max out the RAM on the Late 2015 27 inch iMacs:

Currently, they stock the following:

  * 4GB modules
  * 8gb modules
  * 16gb modules

This means that you have a few choices for upgrade configurations using these 3 different memory upgrade sizes combined with the 4 slots available and if you really need it you can spend **more than $1000** on ram for new 27 inch iMac models. I didn&#8217;t think that was possible in this day and age still.

Your options for ram upgrades are:

  * 8GB Memory upgrade kits
  * 16GB Memory upgrade kits
  * 32GB memory upgrade kits
  * 64GB memory upgrade kits 

Remember these new late 2015 iMacs don&#8217;t take the same ram as the older models so the pricing is different for the newer and more expensive RAM. You need 1866MHz PC3-14900 SO-DIMMS for Apple&#8217;s latest Macs.
