When you look or serarch  for 8 gigabytes of computer memory to to go inside or to be installed into a MacBook Pro you&#8217;r  really looking for 2x4GB memory modules because at the time of writing 8GB can only be installed in the newer MacBook Pro models from Apple and not all.

But how hard can it be? Order the MacBook  from whomever,  but buy your memory from a memory store you can trust. It just so happens that I  know a few stores that are reputable where you can get a pretty good deal on MacBook Pro memory.  Over the years I have personally used every vendors ram that I list without problem. In fact back in about 98 ( I know, you were 8) there was some sort of kerfuffle about some macs not recognizing the RAM and the Mac Web was all uptight &#8211; what if their memory didn&#8217;t work?  Nobody knew and nobody  bothered to pick up the phone  and ask: If I have ram trouble with your memory, then what happens? Such a simple question so I picked up the phone ( land line back in the day)  and called every memory store. Every store but one said without a doubt they fully guarantee the ram they sell and would replace it. Every single store. Not suprisingly, the memory store that didn&#8217;t gaurantee their stuff is long long out of business and  in fact, they let their domain name expire and a very nice gentleman in Montreal now runs  a memory store  and yes, he will guarantee the memory he sells.

So if you do need 8G RAM &#8211; buy ram from a store you can trust and be happy knowing that your MacBook Pro will run just fine and if in the small chance there is a problem that the memory is guaranteed.
