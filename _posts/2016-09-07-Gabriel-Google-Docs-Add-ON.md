This little add-on changed my workflow. I can write in Google Docs and then published to my site hosted on github pages. I select the site I want to post to and the add-on takes care of the rest. It even adds images to the article or post.

> This is a simple Google Apps 'Add-On' which converts a Google Doc to a text based format called Markdown. It adds a little metadata (in YAML format) about the document (e.g. a title, author, categories/tags) and commits it (together with any associated images) to a Github Repository (repo).
