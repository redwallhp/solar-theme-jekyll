This is a neat find: There&#8217;s actually a markdown writing program for the PowerPC called [Simple Mark][1]

I found it at[ G5 Center][2], which is a site dedicated to all things PowerMac G5:

> The Power Mac G5 was one of the last PowerPC machines [Apple][3] produced and sold. It remains a capable computer today. This website is dedicated to the venerable machine, providing users with information on available hardware and software choices for their G5.

I never did get around to owning a Power Mac G5, but I&#8217;ve always loved the looks and I bet with the processor-light workflow I have I could probably be pretty productive on a ten-plus year old Mac. If I did get one I would of course [max out the ram][4]

*incidentally, the Power Mac G5 is Low End Mac&#8217;s [Mac of the day][5] today*
