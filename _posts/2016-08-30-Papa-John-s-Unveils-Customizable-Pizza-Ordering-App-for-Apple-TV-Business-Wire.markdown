> The Papa John’s app for Apple TV is the first customizable pizza ordering platform, offering customers the choice to build their pizza topping by topping or select from past and saved orders. When ordering through the Apple TV app, customers automatically receive a 25 percent discount on their purchase—no separate code required.
