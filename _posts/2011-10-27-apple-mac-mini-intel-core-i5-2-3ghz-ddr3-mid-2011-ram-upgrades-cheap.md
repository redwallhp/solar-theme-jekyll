**[Apple Mac Mini Intel Core i5 2.3Ghz DDR3 &#8211; Mid- 2011][1]**

[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2798" title="Cheapest Apple Mac Mini 2.3 GHz" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Screen-Shot-2011-09-02-at-7.28.18-AM.png" alt="Best Price on Apple Mac Mini" width="278" height="194" />][1]

The Apple Mac mini Intel Core i5 2.3 GHZ was a slightly less powerful version of the Mac Mini introduced in mid-2011. The Mac Mini was the first Mac desktop for the consumer market. Conceived as an entry level model to the Apple product line, like its sibling unit the Mac Mini 2.6 GHz i5, it  has no display, keyboard or mouse and no built-in optical drive. Apple promoted this as “Bring Your Own Display, Keyboard and Mouse…” to justify the lower cost.  By eliminating the optical drive in all Mac Minis since the first they were able to reduce their initial MSRP down one hundred dollars from its predecessor.

The Apple Mac mini Intel Core i5 2.3 included the server version as part of the Mac OS, as have all Mac minis since the first revision of the model in mid 2010.
