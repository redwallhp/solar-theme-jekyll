[Goodbye from MacNN, and Managing Editor Mike Wuerthele - MacNN](http://www.macnn.com/articles/16/06/30/21.years.180000.articles.personally.four.years.and.five.million.words.134776/)

>This is it. The last unique words on the MacNN homepage, barring some miracle.

This is too bad. I hadn't visited MacNN  in some time, but it's a shame to see a longtime site in the Apple community  end and stop publishing.
