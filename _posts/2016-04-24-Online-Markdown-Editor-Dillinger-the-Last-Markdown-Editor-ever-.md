In my quest for the perfect writing workflow, I have found this to be a pretty nice online markdown edtior. 

I really like that it allows you to connect to your github account and make changes directly from the app. 

And, because it's online and browswer based - you can use this to write from anywhere. 

My only complaint, is that I get an error when connecting and retrieving files from Google Drive, so as much as I like this - I will still stick to using Calmly Writer as my current writing tool of choice. 

Regardless, it's a nice little web app.
