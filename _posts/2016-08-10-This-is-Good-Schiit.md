This has to be the [best company name](http://schiit.com/). Ever.  

These folks make high end audio gear specializing in USB DACs and Headphone Amplifiers. I've had the magni/modi usb dac and headphone amp combo in the past and it sounded awesome. 

They now have 'version 2' of this rig and for under $200 this is a steal if youâ€™re serious about your headphone listening.
