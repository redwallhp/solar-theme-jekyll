You know, these days almost &#8211; and the key word here is almost, any RAM you buy today for the iMac that meets the specifications f0r your Apple iMac will work and do the trick so you don&#8217;t really need a review on memory, as it either works or it doesn&#8217;t. There&#8217;s not a whole lot of gray when it comes to RAM (lots of gray market memory though, and you do want to stay away from memory stores that offer questionable RAM) as it either works just fine, or it doesn&#8217;t

**[Kingston 8GB Memory Upgrade. The Best iMac RAM Today][1]**

**[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1684" title="Best Deal on iMac Memory" alt="Best Selling iMac RAM today" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Screen-shot-2011-04-11-at-12.28.37-PM.png" width="308" height="292" />][2]**

**How To Determine the Right iMac RAM To Buy**

Apple iMac RAM comes in many sizes from 1GB (actually 32mb and up, but any iMac worth upgrading today probably requires at least 1GB of RAM to run today&#8217;s Apple OS and Apple Applications smoothly) all the way up to 16GB on the 2010 iMacs, and look for even greater ram capacities on newer 2011 Apple iMacs that although they have not been released yet, will be sure to be here this summer or spring and my guess is they will take more than the 16GB maximum RAM that the iMacs currently run.

One of the easiest methods to determine the correct memory for your iMac is to use the Apple Menu to tell you both the processor speed of your current Apple iMac and also the speed the memory runs at, which for current 2010 (still current in 2011) Apple iMac is DDR3 SDRAM sodimms running at 1333Mhz.

**Apple iMac Memory Choices**  
[table id=2 /]

iMac memory &#8211;  regardless of brand name, or even where you buy it from, which I will get to in a minute comes in essentially two flavors. One, is the name brand ram and at time of writing this up Kingston RAM for iMac seems to be the best selling iMac memory you can buy today and 8GB will cost you under $100. But, there&#8217;s other choices too such as Crucial Memory, another well respected  iMac memory brand.

Or, if you want to save even more money  on RAM  you can buy Generic RAM from a **[selection of memory stores][3] **that offer better prices on iMac RAM, s  these stores for the most part sell only Generic RAM. This RAM brand, or lack of brand really is still a tested high quality memory upgrade, but it&#8217;s made in house by  some memory stores,  or bought in bulk where the savings on ram upgrades can be passed on to you &#8211; the consumer. This type of RAM is cheaper as there is no logo or sticker on the memory  upgrade and in my experience ships in a small plain envelope which costs less than the fancy packaging the name brand RAM is supplied in.

**Summary**

All RAM for iMac will work just fine, but at the  time I write this the best selling and most popular iMac memory upgrade is the **[8GB Kingston Brand DDR3 for Apple iMac][1]** memory upgrade kit priced under $100.
