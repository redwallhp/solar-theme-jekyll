**[Best RAM for MacBook Pro 2.8GHz Intel Core 2 Duo 15 inch][1]**

**<img class="alignleft" title="Cheapest RAM for MacBook Pro 2.8" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41XadRhTtrL._SL500_AA300_.jpg" alt="8GB Kit (4GBx2) Upgrade for a Apple MacBook Pro 2.8GHz Intel Core 2 Duo (15-inch DDR3) Mid-2009 System (DDR3 PC3-8500, NON-ECC, )" width="300" height="300" />  
** In our increasingly mobile, fast paced society&#8211;the need for processing speed on laptop and notebook computers has created a second issue of importance for end users: longer battery life. With business and professional users of the Apple product line travelling more and working increasingly from venues outside the office cubicle the need for longer battery life was increasingly important.

Apple introduced the Apple MacBook Pro 2.8GHz Intel Core 2 Duo 15” in the summer of 2009 to address this issue with its “innovative built-in battery for up to 40 percent longer battery life.”

In the past, a longer lived battery meant adding more bulk to the computer, a major selling point of the Apple MacBook Pro2.8GHz 15” was the fact that this model and those subsequent extended useable wireless battery power to seven hours on a single charge without adding to the size, weight or price of the unit. Distinguished by “Adaptive Charging”, the new battery iteration promised to deliver up to 1000 recharges before reaching 80 percent of original capacity. This innovation was at the time nearly three times the lifespan of conventional computer batteries. Not only was longer battery life attractive in terms of end use, the increasingly “Green” conscious consumer could well appreciate that longer battery life means fewer depleted batteries and less waste. Further appeal to the environmentally minded, this model along with the entire MacBook Pro line up achieved EPEAT* Gold status and meets Energy Star 5.0 requirements a new standard for environmentally friendly notebook design.

The Apple MacBook Pro2.8GHz 15” included the equally green LED backlit display, renowned for its greater color intensity with a 1440 x 900 standard resolution; the processor a speedy 2.8 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo with 6MB shared L2 cache. This model also featured the glass Multi-Touch™ trackpad, an illuminated keyboard, an SD card or ExpressCard slot, a FireWire® 800 port and state of the art NVIDIA graphics married with a 2.8 GHz Core 2 Duo processor, a 500 GB hard drive.

The Apple MacBook Pro2.8GHz 15” offered the following features:

Lightweight, environmentally friendly aluminum unibody case;

1066 MHz front-side bus;

500GB serial ATA hard drive running at 5400 rpm, with Sudden Motion Sensor;
