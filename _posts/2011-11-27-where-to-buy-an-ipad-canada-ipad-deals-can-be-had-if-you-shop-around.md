I have yet to succumb to the siren call that is the Apple iPad as frankly,  I don&#8217;t know I would have as much use for it. I find that my fancy new Verizon phone pretty much does all an iPad  would and yet is still small enough to fit  in my pocket.

But, I&#8217;m getting close to pull the trigger on some sort of tablet, and preferably an iPad  due to the tight integration of other Apple products I already own, so now that I am in the market for a tablet of some kind, where do I find a good deal on an Apple iPad in Canada?

**[Apple Canada][1] iPad Deals **

You won&#8217;t find much in the way of deals on an iPad here, but  you can get your iPad engraved  &#8211; something you cannot do at any other computer store that I am aware of in Canada. There&#8217;s also the satisfaction of knowing you bought your iPad directly from Apple instead of some third party.

**[Future Shop ][2]iPad Deals**

The iPad is rarely on sale here, but I have seen the odd  sale on iPads here &#8211; especially when new Apple iPads are released. A good time to buy an iPad 2 is when the upcoming and rumored Apple iPad 3 is released.

**[Best Buy][3]** iPad Deals

Like Future Shop,  it&#8217;s not very often to see a deal on a brand new iPad from this store either.

The best way to get an iPad Deal might be to either import an iPad from the USA, but then you have the hassle of customs brokerage and assosciated fees, so please do your homework on how much money you will really save if you buy your iPad from the USA.

One last suggestion: If you&#8217;re patient you may be able to get a good deal on a iPad at craigslist if you feel you can trust the vendor. The iPad is an expensive electronic  device that&#8217;s portable and can be dropped so be sure to do your due diligence on buying a used iPad from an unknown  source.
