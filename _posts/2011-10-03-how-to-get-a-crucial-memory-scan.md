In addition to using the Crucial system scan method to get the right memory for your computer, you can also use the <a>Crucial SSD, or Solid Stat Drive recommendation tool</a> to assist you in finding a solid state drive for your computer in addition to adding more computer memory.

Crucial Solid State Hard Drives are starting to drop in price where they are an affordable computer upgrade. Compared to the price of RAM, the solid state drive still has a way to go before the general public will jump in and accept them but it&#8217;s only a matter of time as the hard drive sizes for solid state technology continue to grow and yet the same time drop in price.

Using the Crucial solid state tool to upgrade your hard drive ensures that your computer can accept a solid state hard drive upgrade, as not all computer models are equipped for such without extensive modification or sometimes not at all, so I advise you to be sure you can use or benefit from a solid state hard drive upgrade before you spend your hard earned money only to find a solid state drive is not compatible.
