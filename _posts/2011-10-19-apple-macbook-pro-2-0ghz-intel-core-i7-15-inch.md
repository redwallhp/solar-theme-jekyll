Intel’s recently redesigned quad core Intel Core i7 chipset increased performance on the early 2011 releases by 50 percent offering more speed, stability and reliability out of the box. Well suited to both gaming and professional multi application computing, the early 2011 generation of MacBook Pro models set new benchmarks for laptop performance across the board.

Apple MacBook Pro 2.0GHz Intel Core i7 15 inch featured the 2.0 GHZ Intel quad core i7 processor, code named “Sandy Bridge”. This generation of chipsets was singular in putting the processor, cache, integrated graphics and memory controller all on the same die, exponentially increasing processing speed by the seemingly simple theory of data having less chip distance to cross in processing. The i7 processors also introduced HD graphics formerly only available in the up market end of the product line to lower end models such as the MacBook Pro 2.0 GHz. Utilizing Hyperthreading technology, which transformed the 4 core Intel processors into 8 virtual cores in this model.
