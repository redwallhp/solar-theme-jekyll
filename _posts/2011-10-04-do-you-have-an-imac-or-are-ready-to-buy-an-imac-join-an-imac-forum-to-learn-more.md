I&#8217;ve been working with Apple computers for so long that I sometimes forget that not everybody has the same skillset and knowledge as I do and  may have questions about their new iMac, or even if they are [ready to buy an iMac][1] they may need help with choosing the best Apple iMac for their needs  or even ask if the Apple iMac is right for them in the first place, and would they be better off buying a cheaper windows PC.

**Ask iMac Questions and Get iMac Answers on iMac Forums **

Thanks to the wonders of the internet there&#8217;s a whole world of information out there about Apple iMacs, on both new and old [discontinued iMacs][2]  and as such lots of iMac users are ready to help you with your questions, but also allow you  to join a community designed around the Apple iMac where you can discusss the pros and cons of your favorite Apple desktop compute  for consumers.

Of course,  the [biggest iMac community][3] is found at  the mothership at Apple with forums dedicated to both the newer Intel based Apple iMacs but also the slower PPC Apple iMacs too are discussed at length at Apple with lots of knowledgeable  Apple users willing to help and discuss the Apple iMac with you. From help with iMac Hardware or iMac software you&#8217;ll find somebody  willing  to help you with your iMac questions.

But the Apple iMac Community is  not  the only forum dedicated  to the Apple iMac  and more information  on the Apple iMac can be found at other websites dedicated to the Apple iMac both new and old:

[Mac Rumors iMac Forum][4]

[MacNN iMac Forum][5]

[CNET  iMac Forum][6]

[Amazon iMac Forum][7]

There&#8217;s more iMac forums online, but  these are the best five Apple iMac forums available today for  the Apple iMac computer and you&#8217;re best to stick with the larger sites due mostly to the volume of  iMac users these sites attract.

Of course, if you&#8217;re looking to upgrade the memory on your Apple iMac, you don&#8217;t need a forum to help you with the best deal on iMac RAM as I have all the answers right here with  the lowest prices on iMac RAM from the best memory stores online :
