Just a quick note that I'm trying out a new host today: [Pubstorm](https://www.pubstorm.com/). I was serving from github pages and that was just fine, but Pubstorm allows me not to worry to much about all the confusing git stuff. 

All I have to do is fire up a terminal, and enter 'storm publish'. No more commits or pull and push errors I keep on seeming to have. 

I'm not sure if I will stay here, but itâ€™s **free hosting **same as github pages and it seems to be a bit faster too.
