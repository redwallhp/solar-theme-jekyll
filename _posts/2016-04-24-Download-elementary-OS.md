 [Download elementary OS](http://elementary.io/)

I forgot about this version of linux, and have been using [ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com) as my daily driver currently, but I might like to give this OS a shot too. It looks to have a very apple OS X feel to it and for new users or those coming from Mac OS it might be a moref familiar environment.
