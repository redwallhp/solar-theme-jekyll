I have been wanting to change the look and layout of ramseeker for some time, yet still keep some of older design cues from when the site was first designed some 15 plus years ago and I think I&#8217;ve got the look I want.<sup id="fnref-13071-vary"><a href="#fn-13071-vary" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>

I was going to write about my plans for ramseeker.com going forward but my [about][1] page pretty much sums up my plans so no sense in repeating myself.

<li id="fn-13071-vary">
  famous last words. this might change.&#160;<a href="#fnref-13071-vary" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a> </fn></footnotes>
