I have been following the Apple [discussion thread on macintouch.com](http://www.macintouch.com/readerreports/apple/index.html#d30apr2016) with interest as I agree with a lot that's been said.

In the past, I loved the fact that Apple computers have been upgradable, but a lot of great stuff has been written by readers at [Macintouch](http://www.macintouch.com) about how the ugpradablity of the current Macs are almost non-existent now and that Apple has lost some of their loyal customers who need powerful machines to other OS's like Windows and Linux versions.

It's worth a look.
