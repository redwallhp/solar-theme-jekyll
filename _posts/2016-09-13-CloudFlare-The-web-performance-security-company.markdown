I just switched my nameservers over to clouldflare and with a bit of tweaking, I now have a secure https:// site instead of an unsecure site.

I don't know that it matters much as there's only text on the site for the most part, and a few links but hey what the heck - it was **free*

I think there's a chance that having a secure site will give your SEO a bump too so time will tell if this tweak was worth the effort.
