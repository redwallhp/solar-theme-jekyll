Mac Memory doesn&#8217;t have to be expensive.

[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1332" title="Cheapest Apple Mac Mini" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-3.45.39-PM.png" alt="Best Mac Mini Prices" width="281" height="169" />][1]

**[Cheapest Apple Mac ][1]**

Well, it can be expensive or pricey for memory but that just means you&#8217;re not shopping hard enough for the best deal on ram, or if you prefer: inexpensive mac memory, or cheap memory for your mac.

The good news is you&#8217;re at the right place to get a fair deal on high quality memory upgrades. I&#8217;ve been confused in the past as an online store that sells memory but I leave that to the memory professionals such as 18004Mememory, Memory X, OEMPCWORLD, RAMJET, Data Memory Systems, OWC, Crucial Technology  and a few other memory stores that either specialize in Apple memory or memory for your macs for much less than what you might pay from name brand memory stores such as directly from Apple.

If you&#8217;re looking for cheap ram from Apple directly you&#8217;ll be looking long and hard to fin  some. They do sell ram but it&#8217;s expensive: 8GB for MacBook Pro will set you back $600 as opposed to much much less &#8211; about half price &#8211; when you buy ram from the memory stores I do list.

At one point I used to offer a much longer list of memory stores that sold RAM but they haven&#8217;t been in business for decades or even longer. I think OWC has been helping Apple users get a good deal on upgrades since &#8217;88. That&#8217;s a long time to be in business and you don&#8217;t accomplish that by under selling at the lowest ram price. You get to 25 years in business by supporting the Apple community and making sure you offer a competitive product at a competetive price and that&#8217;s what I specialize in: tracking and monitoring ram prices from the memory stores that have been around for some time and offer great deals and more importantly &#8211; great support on the products they sell.

Even yours truly has 13 years tracking ram prices so I know a good deal on ram when I see it ( ram just gets cheaper and cheaper year after year) Buy good ram that&#8217;s cheap or [inexpensive mac memory ][2]from a memory store you can trust and  you will have problem  free computing regardless  what apple computer you have and need to upgrade
