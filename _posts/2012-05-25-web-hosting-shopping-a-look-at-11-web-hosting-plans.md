There was a time when I didn&#8217;t really care about web hosting and happily paid three thousand dollars a year or more for a dedicated web server to host this site (and others), but as the demand for RAM has leveled off and the ram prices have dropped, I am starting to look for ways to save money on my annual web hosting bill.

**I&#8217;m with [Pair][1]. **

A few years back, I switched platforms to use wordpress instead of my ever so more complicated html setup. I&#8217;ve had a few complaints about tracking the ram prices for the older macs, but my research shows you folks are not looking for ram for older Macs so I now just concentrate on the newer Apple computer models as those are the Macs people are buying and need to upgrade the RAM on. I can speak from personal experience that the only time I have ever bought RAM is when I needed to upgrade the RAM on a brand new Mac &#8211; most recently being an Apple Mac Mini I upgraded with 8gb of RAM.

Anyway, back to the web hosting: In an effort to cut costs I transferred this site to shared hosting and except for the odd burp in service, I don&#8217;t really have any complaint with them except for the fact that for shared hosting &#8211; at $85.00 a month they&#8217;re kind of pricey when I compare other web hosting packages available online.

This will, I think be the first in a series of web hosting plan comparisons I hope to do as I can&#8217;t help myself &#8211; I like to shop and get the best price on stuff, whether it&#8217;s web hosting or memory upgrades and 1&1 web hosting is the first host I found alphabetically so I&#8217;ll start there:

**1&1 Web Hosting Plans**

The good folks at 1&1 offer a few plans but the best web hosting from 11 web hosting costs just a little over 3 bucks a month. Even with the 25% discount I got from Pair networks that&#8217;s still a significant savings over the $80 a month I am paying now for web hosting. a

I really don&#8217;t need a lot for my web hosting needs, as this is just a blog and I bet that any old host would work for my site and traffic load. I would need some mysql databases for the wordpress databases and unlimited traffic and storage space that this cheap web hosting plan from 11 web hosting offers.

I don&#8217;t care less about free domain names, email accounts, ssl certificates and or dual hosting. I may be inclined to upgrade the hostin to their business web hosting as opposed to their personal plan, only for the fact that the performance may be better and I think the faster ramseeker is the better.

I can always pay more for web hosting later too, as I have yet to find any business that will not take more money than you are currently paying.
