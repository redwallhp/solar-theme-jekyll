I've used this in the past and I never found it to work with my workflow when I hosted this site via wordpress, and now that I host on github I have even less use for this app, but if you're looking for an easy way to blog with iOS, this free software is a good choice. 

Also, I have found that updates for this software come pretty quick too.
