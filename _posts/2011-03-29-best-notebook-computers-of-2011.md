Now that we&#8217;ve got three months or so into the year 2011, I thought it might be a good time to stop and check out the best selling notebook computers in 2011 to date, as the best computer in 2010 can be nowhere to be seen a month or so later as new notebook models are announced two things happen. The first is that the now discontinued models of computers go on sale as the manufacturers want to clear the inventory  of older notebooks so that the only notebooks in the sales channel are the newly announced laptops.

This has always been this way and the best time to buy a notebook could be the day the new models are announced as yesterday&#8217;s new and modern laptop  is now on sale for much less money than the day before.  I have bought many an Apple notebook this way, and saved at very least about 10 percent, if not  more of deal on a MacBook Pro. The new MacBook Pro&#8217;s get released, and the older MacBook Pro&#8217;s go on sale. This technique only works if you  understand the needs for your personal situation as for some, saving money on notebooks might not be worth it and you&#8217;re best to buy the latest and new laptop instead.

Let&#8217;s have a look at what&#8217;s the **[best deal and best selling notebook][1]** to date in 2011:

**[Apple MacBook Pro 13 inch][2]**

**[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1552" title="Best Notebook Computer in 2011" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-29-at-7.19.01-AM.png" alt="Cheapest 2011 Apple Notebook" width="299" height="232" />][2]**

A decade or so ago, the idea of an Apple Computer being the best selling computer today in any format  &#8211; notebook  or  desktop, would be considered laughable with PC notebooks being the best sellers year over year, but over the years Apple has reversed their fortunes and now make  the best notebook you can buy today with the Apple MacBook Pro 13 inch model. Featuring a dual core Intel i5 processor running at 2.3GHz, this particular Apple MacBook Pro also holds the distinction of being the cheapest notebook from Apple you can buy in the MacBook Pro lineup. With this model, the Pro version of Apple&#8217;s notebook is within reach of most consumers and is priced just 20% more than the Apple MacBook, Apple&#8217;s consumer notebook.

As with all notebook releases, the MacBook Pro runs faster than it&#8217;s predecessors but also brings new technology to the Apple notebook arena in the form of Thunderbolt I/O Technology which is much faster than USB and even FireWire and the first Mac, notebook or desktop to feature this new high speed interface. More RAM, a 320 GB hard drive and a new FaceTime built in web camera round out what&#8217; new on the MacBook Pro and why  it is the best selling notebook computer today.

**[Toshiba Satellite L655-S5158 15.6-Inch Laptop][3]**

**[<img title="Best Selling Toshiba Notebook " src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-29-at-11.37.08-AM.png" alt="Cheapest Toshiba NoteBook" width="287" height="205" />][3]**

[**See Cheapest **][3]**[Toshiba Satellite L655-S5158 15.6-Inch Laptop Price][3]**

One of the biggest reasons for the Toshiba Satellite L655-S5158 to take the number  2 spot is the fact that it&#8217;s one of the better value notebooks available today when it comes to price. For the MacBook Pro above, the discount is rather tiny when compared to this Toshiba notebook that comes in priced at half the price of the Apple Mac above.

Featuring a fast **2.53 GHz Intel Core i3-380M dual-core processor **with Intel HD graphics, and with the help of the Intel Hyper-Threading technology that allows you do two tasks at the same time resulting in even more productivity when working with this 15.6 inch Toshiba notebook computer.

4GB of DDR3 SDRAM ships standard with the Toshiba and a 640 GB hard drive means you will have lots of room for your files, photos, music and movies and with up  to five hours of battery life that helps when you need remote computing away from power supplies, such as when traveling, the Toshiba Satellite L655-S51858 notebooks is the perfect travel notebook whether your travels take you around the world or just next door.

**[Acer AS5736Z-4427 15.6-Inch Laptop][4]**

**[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1555" title="Cheapest Acer Notebook" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-29-at-11.39.19-AM.png" alt="Best Acer Laptop" width="312" height="283" />][4]**

**[Click for Best Price on Acer AS5736z-4427][1]**

One of the biggest reasons the Acer AS5736Z-4427  is on the best selling notebooks list is that this is the cheapest notebook of the top 3 notebooks  for 2011 and is one of the few notebooks under $400. While the two laptop computers above are priced more, don&#8217;t let this lowest priced notebook fool you into thinking this is a cheap acer notebook that&#8217;s not up to the task.

The 15.6 inch LCD widescreen display is perfect for fun stuff like watching movies thanks to it&#8217;s 16:9 widescreen display,  and the fast dual-core Intel Pentium T4500 processor that&#8217;s more than fast enough for everyday computing such as facebook, email, web browsing  and working with digital files such as movies, music and digital photos. 2GB of DDR RAM, a 250 GB hard drive, Windows 7, and Microsoft Office Starter Kit just a few of the more notable features on this cheap acer computer that for the price, is hard to beat and offers much better value than a cheap netbook computer might offer but with the Acer you can enjoy a full size keyboard and screen, something even the best netbooks can&#8217;t match.

You can&#8217;t go wrong with any one of the best selling notebooks available today as they offer excellent value and are available to buy in every price point, regardless of your notebook computer budget
