I recently switched from over a decade of using a Mac every day to using a PC notebook. Why? I find that most of my use for my notebook is email and writing and all of this can be done in any browser window. I prefer Chrome from Google as when I compare my open windows from Mac to PC there&#8217;s not much difference between a[ $2000 MacBook  Pro][1] and a[ $500 PC notebook. ][2]

**Security Programs for PC NoteBooks vs Mac Laptops **

One area where I really was unprepared was when it comes to security software. This is one area where the Mac just shines and that&#8217;s with viruses &#8211;  or the  lack thereof I have experienced on an Apple notebook in all the years I have been using Apple computers.  Compare to a PC, where you need to buy an antivirus program from the moment you turn on your PC and this left me asking what is the best Antivirus software in 2012?

**Free Antivirus Software from Microsoft. **

One solution for Windows 7 Antivirus software is to download the free **[Microsoft Security Essentials][3]. **I know there are other antivirus and security options out there. Some free, like [AVG][4] and some that will cost you a few dollars from [McAfee][5], [Kaperksy ][6]and [Norton ][5]to name a few, but I figure who would know more about protecting their products more? The folks that made the software you want to protect or  some third party antivirus software company?

In my books it makes perfect sense to trust Microsoft for my Antivirus needs.  I guess it all depends on what you need form  an Antivirus program and from my research that some software excels where others fail, but Microsoft Security essentials meets my needs for one reason: It&#8217;s free antivirus software.  I swear, the the older I get  &#8211; the cheaper  I get and the thought of  having to pay over $100 for some software to protect my PC that&#8217;s not worth much more than that in total hardware costs just does not make sense to me.

**Free Antivirus Software That Works**

But just because this free software to protect your PC does not  mean it&#8217;s no good. Take a look at the feature set for the 2012 version of Microsoft Security Essentials:

Real Time Protection of your PC from spyware, viruses and other malware (malicious software &#8211; that&#8217;s a fancy term for software that  is up to no good)

System Cleaning automatically quarantines any questionable files on your PC it finds and notifies you of the potential threat.

System Scanning does just what it says it does and scans your system for any viruses you may already have on your Windows PC but not know  it.

Automatic Firewall Protection. The firewall settings can be tricky  to navigate for  the average PC user like me  and  the MSE takes care of all that  technical stuff for me.

Rootkit protection sounds complicated, and this is just one more thing that  the free antivirus software from Microsoft takes care of for me and it&#8217;s sophisticated enough  to recognize the good software from the bad that could  harm your PC.

And this is the part that I was really impressed with &#8211; Microsoft Essentials takes care of the network protection as  I am totally lost when it comes to protecting other computers on my home network. I am  happy to hand this task off to Microsoft.

**Why is  this antivirus software for Windows 7 Free? **

Microsoft could have charged for this &#8211; and charged  a pretty competitive price too. Others that offer free antivirus usually are really fremium where the whole point is to nag you to death until you cave and buy their full featured software and thus, the income stream.  I think Microsoft offers this antivirus software for free is for goodwill.

Think about it : If this free software keeps your Windows 7 PC running smoothly and trouble free you are more likely to think that Windows is overall is a better value, and  over time you will continue to buy more Windows PCs allowing  Microsoft to sell more software. You may win short term,  but in  the end Microsoft gets to keep you as a loyal customer which is something they value more than any $20 profit on anivirus software.

Have a look at **[Microsoft Security Essentials][3]**. MSE download is free,  so this all costs you nothing but the time to install Microsoft Essentials download. This is one of the best software available today for keeping your PC virus free for free.  It&#8217;s working fine for me.
