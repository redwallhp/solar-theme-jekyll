description: Does the speed of your phone matter?

 Dan Knight at Low End Mac makes [some interesting thoughts on speed](http://lowendmac.com/2016/iphone-history-small-steps-and-big-leaps) increases on iPhones as they have progressed:




> I think we’ve come to the end of the big forward leaps in processing power. We may see 3- and 4-core processors and higher clock speeds, but even then don’t expect to see a tripling – or even doubling – of performance from one iPhone generation to the next.


I think he's right. I have jumped from an iPhone 4s to 5 and an iPad Mini as the 3 apple iOS devices and to be honest - they all work great and the speed doesn't seem all that different to me. The reviews state the iPhone SE to be super fast, but when I quickly demoed one the other day at Best Buy, I came away unimpressed.

There used to be a day when speed mattered more. Now, I think it's battery life that does.
