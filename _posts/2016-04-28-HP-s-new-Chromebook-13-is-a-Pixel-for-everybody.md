Do you really need 16GB of RAM in a Chromebook? It seems like overkill. I have a 2GB and 4GB Chromebook and to be honest, I don't see any difference in performance. 

Also, the price - that's MacBook territory, and a pretty expensive ram upgrade to go from 4GB to 16GB

> Only the top of the range model gets 16GB of RAM, paired with a Core m7-6Y75 for $1,029. Shipments are expected to start next month.

If you can live with 4GB, there's a $499.00 version. 

Still, it's a nice looking machine.
