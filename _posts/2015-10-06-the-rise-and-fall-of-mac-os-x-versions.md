Dan Knight at Low End Mac has [quite the interesting chart][1] with six years of data of the Mac OS versions that are used when visiting his site from 2009 to 2015:

> Over time, the distribution of Mac OS versions among Mac users changes as new versions of the OS are released, old Macs are retired, and new models arrive that only support the most recent version. Today we’re looking at six years worth of data.

I bet this took a fair bit of time to gather all the data and chart it all out.
