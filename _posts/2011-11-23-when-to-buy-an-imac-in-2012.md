First, I want to say that considering we are in the last bit of 2011 and the last iMac refresh was in May, (MacBook Pros for 2011 were just released in  October) I would **wait to [buy an iMac][1] right now **as there&#8217;s a very good chance we&#8217;ll see new iMacs models released  in 2012.

[<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4187" title="Should  I Buy an iMac Now?" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/41cC5NM63DL._SL500_AA300_.jpg" alt="Cheap iMac Deals" width="300" height="300" />][2]

**Is 2012 The  End of the iMac?**

Over the years, notebooks and now tablets have become increasingly popular so the one question I have to ask is will there even be an Apple  iMac  in 2012?  The iPad in a way has all but replaced the iMac except for two important options :

1. screen size. A 27 inch iPad would be pretty heavy  (and expensive)

2. Full size keyboard. You can&#8217;t touch type on a tablet. You could possibly connect a third party keyboard to an Apple iPad, but then you really have something that resembles a notebook or MacBook Air mor than a tablet.

I know that having a big screen can be more beneficial than having a faster processor (as I type this, I have 87% of my processor doing nothing at all) The iMac is/was a success due to the design over all else. That all in one design is attractive and cable free. This can&#8217;t be overlooked when marketing to the small office or home  computer crowd.

**Wait and See. **

As I write this,  the iMac has been a current model for over six months &#8211;  a lifetime when talking about computers. Apple&#8217;s release schedule  has been pretty much spot on the past  few years &#8211; new iMacs in early spring and maybe an iPad, early winter for  notebooks, and fall for the iPod and holiday shopping market.  I can see a  new iMac in about May 2012,  so  if you  can wait to buy a new Apple iMac,  I would  &#8211; if for no other reason to see what Apple does next.

Both the Apple iMac and MacBook Pro lines are in need of a makeover and Apple is rumored to make the MacBook Pro of 2012 more like the MacBook Air, and  the design on the  iMac has been the same for so long I wonder if Apple will release a brand new desktop computer in the summer of 2012?

Only time will tell of course, but I would think it  would be wise to hold off until summer 2012 if you can to  see what the new or replacement iMacs end up looking like. I think the wait will be worth it.
