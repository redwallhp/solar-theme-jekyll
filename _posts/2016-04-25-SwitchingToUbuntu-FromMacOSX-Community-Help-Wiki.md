> OS X is an Apple interface wrapped around a Unix core, whereas Ubuntu is a Unix interface wrapped around a Unix core. This makes switching from OS X much easier than switching from Windows, but still quite challenging. For example, the OS X terminal is almost as powerful as the Linux terminal, but you'll need to use far more of that power in Linux.

This paragraph nails it. It takes some time, but once you get the hang of the terminal in Ubuntu this makes the Ubuntu eperience well worth the switch. I've done it.
