**[Cheapest Apple iMac][1]**

Wow, that&#8217;s quite a title but I just wanted to make a note that I&#8217;ve added Memory To Go RAM  to my **[iMac Memory Upgrades][2] and[ iMac Memory Upgrade Kits][3]** for the new(er) i3, i5 and i7 21 inch iMacs and also 27 inch iMacs too.

Memory To Go offers the memory for the new Apple iMacs in both module and kit sizes so you&#8217;ll have to check both pages to get the best deal on RAM from Memory To Go for the new iMacs. I&#8217;m not going to list exact prices here as the prices will and do change  but you can always check the links I have above for current ram prices for the new Apple iMacs.

At the time I write this, Memory To Go has memory prices in 2gb modules for new Apple iMacs, 4GB modules for Apple iMac and 4GB ram upgrade kits for 4GB and 8GB. Oddly, there&#8217;s no 16gb kit listed even though the new Apple iMacs can accept and use up to 16GB of RAM easily. You could order 2x8gb kits or you could order or buy 4x4gb memory for iMacs too to get to the 16gb maximum ram allowed for the new Apple i3, i5 and i7 iMac models.

Again you can check out the **ram prices for new 1333Mhz Apple iMacs** at the top of the page.
