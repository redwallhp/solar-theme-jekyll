Apple iTunes is in my opinion, the best Apple software for the Mac and the best part is that it&#8217;s included in each and every  Mac you buy

But, over the years iTunes has grown in size to the point where it allows you to buy new music, buy  new videos and TV shows and more at the iTunes store. All this takes more and more processing power over time to the point where if you don&#8217;t have a relatively new Apple computer you may not be able to run the current Generations of iTunes at all.

**Apple iTunes Requirements **

For the Mac, you need at least 512 mb of RAM and either a G4, G5 or Intel Mac for the Application to run. If you have the need to play standard definition video, the requirements rise to at least a 1Ghz G4 and still jus 512mb of RAM.

High Definition Video is where the ram and processor requirements for Apple iTunes really dial up: For 720p high definition video the minimum possible is a 2.0 Ghz Intel Core 2 Duo processor, with twice the  amount  of RAM at 1GB. And if you want full 1080p high definition, the bar gets raised higher at 2.4Ghz Intel Core Duo and 2GB of RAM.

So, if  you&#8217;re just playing music, it seems you can get away with an [older Mac][1], but if you want to use HD video you&#8217;ll need a newer Mac ([from about 2008 and up][2]).

Depending on the speed and RAM on your current computer, you might be able to upgrade the RAM or you may have to buy a brand new Mac to get full HD. The Apple Mac Mini is my favorite Mac for iTunes use as it&#8217;s small, quiet and one of the **[cheapest Mac computers you can buy][3]**.
