When you&#8217;re in the market for a brand new computer in 2013 most all computer buyers this year will tend to be buyers of notebook computers or even tablet computers, but both of those options may not be the best computer of 2013 for you. With a brand new laptop this year it will come equipped with a default install of Windows 8. Many say that Windows 8 is better than Windows 7 when you compare the two versions of Windows you can still buy today. (Why anyone would want to buy Vista is beyond me).

Despite the new Metro design and features offered by Windows 8, some (like me) actually prefer to stick with Windows 7. Why? Because it&#8217;s familiar. I still cannot get used to the new user interface of Windows 8, even if it is considered to be a better Windows operating system. Yes, you could install Windows 7 on a Windows 8 notebook, but then you will have to download Windows 7 from Amazon or some other online retailer that sells Windows 7 and this will cost you at least $100 or so. You&#8217;re better off keeping your older Windows 7 notebook and adding more memory to the notebook you have rather than try to install Windows 7 on a PC designed for Windows 8

Adding more memory to your PC running Windows 7 offers a very big speed increase and the ability to run more applications simultaneously than if you were to just to stick with the standard memory configurations on most notebooks running Windows 7.  It&#8217;s easy to add more ram to a Windows 7 notebook too &#8211; all you have to do is this:

**1. Find out what Memory Type you need to buy**. Most online memory stores can help with this thanks to their online memory configurator. You usually just enter your PC manufacturer, model name and you will get information on what type of memory you need to buy, what the maximum is you can install in your PC and how many memory upgrade slots you have to replace the stock ram with the new RAM.

2. **Remove the old Factory Memory Upgrades. **In most cases, you will have to remove the original RAM from the factory to install new memory upgrades. This is especially true if you are trying to upgrade a notebook computer as there are usually just two memory upgrade slots to use so you will definitely have to remove the factory ram first. With desktop computers running Windows 7, you have a bit more room as there is usually many memory slots (4 or more) and not all memory slots tend to be filled by the factory leaving you with lots of room for additional desktop memory to be installed.

**3. Install Larger Memory Modules. **Once you have removed the older memory modules, and have bought the new ram upgrades for you Windows 7 computer, all you need to do is add the newer  and larger ram upgrades.
