**The [PNY OPTIMA 4GB (2x2GB) Dual Channel Kit DDR2 667 MHz PC2-5300 Notebook / Laptop SODIMM Memory Modules][1] are some of the cheapest ddr2 sodimms on sale today**

The **[4GB DDR2 PC2-5300 memory upgrade kit][2]**Â is a little dated and pretty much any currently shipping and best selling notebook will only accept faster memory upgrades typically running at twice that speed or faster with speeds of 1066Mhz or even 1333Mhz, this is still a very popular memory upgrade to buy, especially if you have an older MacBook or MacBook Pro you need upgrading or want to squeeze a little life out of.

For under $50, this **[cheap 4GB ddr2 pc5300 notebook memory upgrade][2]** is a bargain, especially when you compare what it may cost you to buy a new notebook. You should find that after installing this DDR2 laptop memory upgrade into your Mac or PC notebook that the laptop should run much faster and depending on the processor speed of your processor and other speed issues it&#8217;s not unthinkable to double your computer&#8217;s processing speed by adding a 4GB memory upgrade kit.

**RAM upgrades Are Cheap  
**

RAM Upgrades in 2011 are so cheap right now, I can&#8217;t stress enough if you have been on the fence about a ram upgrade, now is the time to buy. 4GB RAM upgrades kits, regardless of what notebook computer you want to install this memory upgrade into have never been cheaper. This memory module kit currently retails for under $50 and that&#8217;s half the price you would have paid for a ram upgrade just a few short months ago.

I don&#8217;t track ram prices for DDR2 memory any more as I tend to concentrate on the newer and more popular memory, but an example of RAM prices dropping would be that in April an 8GB DDR3 memory upgrade kit would have cost $93.00, and today the cheapest 8GB DDR3 RAM Price can be had for under $40, which should be affordable by anybody looking to upgrade their notebook RAM cheaply in 2011.
