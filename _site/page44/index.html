<br>

		<div class="post-content">Most, when looking for memory upgrades for their computers tend to associate the best computer ram with the cheapest computer RAM and the two don&#8217;t mean the same thing in most cases. You can buy cheap RAM from a long list of [memory sellers][1]. Heck, in an afternoon I could set up a ram memory store and sell you memory, but retail is not one of my strong points so I&#8217;ll stick to helping you get the best deal on RAM and let the others specialize in selling RAM.

**[Best Selling Apple Computer RAM][2] **The [best place to buy RAM, or computer][3] [memory][4], or random access memory, as it is known to be called or RAM for short is from an honest [computer memory store][5] that offers you a good fair price on memory upgrades and offers you the option to return or exchange your memory upgrad in the slight chance that you might have a problem with your laptop upgrade.

So, where to Buy RAM? I compare and monitor memory prices from a select few memory stores who meet my qualification as to what a good memory store should be, and that&#8217;s they should offer a fair price on RAM upgrades for either your Mac or PC computer. I tend to lean towards the Apple computer and am more familiar with Apple Memory such as iMac Memory or MacBook memory, but this is the year I change this and my goal is to help you get the best deal possible on RAM regardless of whether you are a Mac OS or Windows user.

Another resource for buying RAM and where to buy Memory is the [list of memory stores][6] I have created to help you determine where you want to buy RAM from. RAM prices change, (lately, they&#8217;ve been dropping) so you should take some time to get the best deal on ram upgrades because I have found in the years I have been tracking memory that different memory shops have different ideas on the what the definition of lowest price ram means.

If you&#8217;ve been a visitor to ramseeker in the past, it should come as no surprise that I [specialize in Apple memory][1] moreso than the PC brands, in part due to the fact that a: I&#8217;m drinking the Apple Koolaid and am a true blue Apple fan but also the model numbers and names for most PC desktops and notebooks are quite many, compared to the Apple computers which essentially come in both portable and desktop solutions for consumer and business totaling up the entire Apple computer lineup in just 4 models.

But in 2011, the goal is to change this and widen my scope to include not only [HP Memory Prices][2] but Dell, Sony an other computer manufacturers so today I thought it would be a good idea to familiarize myself with the current HP linuep and for today, we&#8217;ll start with notebooks, as they tend to be the more popular computer type over desktop models.

The HP notebook lineup in 2011 is currently broken down to 5 different notebook computer types:

[<img title="Best Priced HP Notebook" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-6.59.41-AM.png" alt="Best Deal on HP Notebooks" width="305" height="270" />][3]

**[Best Priced HP Notebook][3]**

**HP Mini Netbooks  
HP Everyday Notebooks  
HP Ultra Portable Notebooks  
HP High Performance Notebooks  
HP Envy Notebooks  
**

Each and every one of these notebooks can benefit from a computer memory upgrade, and in later articles I want to explore each notebook model from HP seperately and help you find the best deal on a memory upgrade for your HP notebook, but for today what I can do is suggest a few ways to upgrade HP memory and where to get the best price on memory for HP too.

You have three options when it comes to memory upgrades for HP notebooks and desktops. You can buy ram from HP (and boy, will you pay) or you can buy ram from a name brand manufacturer such as [Crucial][4]. You&#8217;ll still pay more than the cheapest option when it comes to HP RAM upgrades, which is to buy generic RAM, but with the name brand ram you will get the perceived value of buying ram from a reputable name brand memory manufacturer.

My favorite way to save money on HP memory upgrades is to buy generic ram from a trusted third party you can trust. I&#8217;ve got a quick list of memory stores in the sidebar that will be happy to not only sell you ram for HP for up to half price, but also offer top notch support if the rare chance you have a problem with your HP RAM.

Generic Memory Upgrades for HP or any other PC manufacturer are my favorite way to save money due to the fact that this ram type is not only half the price you&#8217;d pay for name brand memory but the memory is still manufactured to the same exact standards required by HP but without the cost associated with the more expensive and popular name brand memory.

Lastly, if the list of memory stores I list on this page is not enough, you can always [buy HP RAM][5] from a much bigger list of only memory stores that will gladly help get you the best price on your next [HP Memory Upgrade][4].

<br>

		<div class="post-content">Over the past dozen or so years I have been tracking [Apple memory prices][1], I have found I&#8217;m reluctant to recommend one specific memory store as I have no place to suggest the **best value when it comes to ram upgrades** as value is a subjective thing and for you, the [best place to buy Apple Memory][2] might be Best Buy or some other electronics retailer in the USA as it&#8217;s local and convenient.MacBook Pro RAM is one of the most popular Apple Memory you can buy today:

**[Best Selling Apple Memory][3]**

If you&#8217;re [buying a a new Apple computer][4], then the best bet might be just to order your Apple Mac full of ram direct from the factory. This is in most cases, the most expensive memory you can buy but you gain in convenience and can use Apple&#8217;s one click ordering system to buy the Mac and RAM at the same time. You don&#8217;t need to worry about memory installation instructions or anti-static wrist bands and and the trouble of buying a Mac and then having to worry about where you are going to buy RAM from.

But for most, &#8220;best place&#8221; translates to &#8220;cheapest place&#8221; when it comes to RAM as there&#8217;s a good chance you are looking for a deal on RAM as opposed to paying full price. But you still need to consider the chance of bad ram, as it is super-rare but does happen and if it happens to you you know you want to buy Apple Memory or memory for any PC from a memory store that offers support if you do run into a problem with your apple RAM upgrade.

So I&#8217;ll leave it to you to decide where or whom exactly to buy ram from, but I can make a few suggestions:

  1. Compare Apple RAM prices. If price is the dominant factor when it comes to memory upgrades, then I have done the legwork for you and list current apple memory prices for all Apple computers where you can easily find the price you want for RAM.</p> 
  2. If you&#8217;re just looking for ram stores to buy from, check out my list of **best memory stores** in the sidebar of this article. Every one of these memory sellers have been in business for over ten plus years and have helped thousands get the right ram for your Mac every time.

  3. If number 2 isn&#8217;t enough choice I offer a much **[bigger list of memory stores to buy Apple RAM][5]**

**Apple Memory is cheap**, and you really can&#8217;t go wrong with any of the memory stores I have recommended above. If you need further help with your memory upgrades for Apple or any computer, feel free to contact me. I&#8217;m happy to help.

Today, I want to do a bit of research in helping you find the best deal when it comes to [Lenovo Notebooks][1] and memory upgrades. I can rhyme of technical specs of Apple Memory without the blink of an eye but when it comes to windows PCs, I find the selection and configurations that the PC manufacturers offer to be almost overwhelming. Besides, I&#8217;m an Apple Fan from way back. But RAM is RAM and the same benefit you get from **upgrading your Apple computer **to the most memory possible also applies to PC notebooks too: If you [add more memory to your laptop ][2]it will run smoother and faster and with more applications avialable than before.

**Lenovo Professional Grade Laptops**

[<img title="Best Selling Lenovo Notebook" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-7.17.30-AM.png" alt="Best Selling Lenovo Notebook" width="311" height="281" />][3]

**[Best Lenovo NoteBook Prices][3]**  
This is the higher end Lenovo laptops that are geared to professionals who make a living with their computers and need the strength and reliability that a higher end notebook from Lenovo offers.

The [Lenovo T-series][1] comes in three models: T410, T410s, and T510  
The [Lenovo ThinkPad Edge][1] comes in different screen sizes with 14 inch and 15 inch options and processor choices of Intel or AMD processors  
The [Lenovo Thinkpad L][1] serices is one of the more affordable notebook solutionn  
The [Lenovo Thinkpad W][1] series offers a portable workstation solution for demanding professionals  
The [Lenovo Thinkpad X][1] Tablet offers a tablet option for portable computing needs.  
The [Lenovo Thinkpad X series][1] is the thinnest and lightest professional thinkpad with the longest battery life  
The [Lenovo Thinkpad SL series][1] is the perfect balance between features and price when notebook shopping

**Lenovo Lifestyle Notebooks  
**  
Lenovo calls their notebook lineup aimed at personal use the Lifestyle lineup and offers a few notebook choices to consider:

The [Lenovo S series][1] is built for web browsing and is a small and light netbook that&#8217;s big on value and low on price.  
The [Lenovo U series][1] is a stylish notebook that is the perfect choice for everyday use.

The [Lenovo Z series ][1]offers a balance of price and preformance with more multimedia options than other laptops  
The [Lenovo V series ][4]is for the home business user with extra security and notebook storage options

As you can see Lenovo notebooks come in a wide array of choices and things get more interesting when you combine the different screen options, windows operating systems and processor choices.

But one thing is certain, and that is that each and every Lenovo notebook will benefit from adding more memory and in the future I will research and share with you how to get the [best deal on Lenovo notebook RAM][5].

The **[best memory upgrades for 13 inch Apple MacBook Pro ][1]**is up to you. I can&#8217;t tell you what memory is the best macbook pro ram, but I can tell you the best prices on MacBook Pro memory upgrades which is probably what you mean when you asked me this question.

**Best Prices for 13 inch MacBook Pro RAM Upgrades **

[table id=1 /]

[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1136" title="Best Price MacBook Pro" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-24-at-7.39.14-AM.png" alt="See Best Price on MacBook Pro" width="283" height="223" />][2]

**[Best MacBook Pro Price][2]**

I can also [recommend just a few memory stores][3] where you can [buy ram][4] for MacBook Pro and get a great deal on MBP RAM.  You will get a much better deal buying ram from any one of the memory stores I list and track prices for  than if you were to upgrade the memory from [Apple][5]. Apple RAM is just fine, but you will pay for the pleasure  of buying ram for your MacBook Pro directly from Apple. It&#8217;s quite possible to pay close to twice as much than if you were to buy ram from a respectable and trusted third party memory store.

The [latest MacBook Pro 13 inch models][6] accept up to 8GB of RAM and I suggest  you complete this upgrade as the 8GB RAM for MacBook Pros have dropped in price considerably &#8211;  I see now for the first time you can buy MacBook Pro RAM  for under $100 from some memory upgrade stores. Not too long ago the same memory would cost you close to $1000 for 8GB of MacBook Pro RAM.

This advice applies to  all Apple MacBook Pro models currently shipping, not just the 13 inch model as though the case and screen size might be smaller on the 13inch MacBook Pro, the memory  requirements are exactly the same for the 15 inch and 17 inch MacBook Pro&#8217;s too.

What you want to consider when buying the [best MacBook Pro RAM][4] is price, sure   &#8211; but also warranty in the rare occassion you do get stuck with a bad ram chip you want the piece of mind that comes with a lifetime warranty when shopping for memory upgrades for any Mac, not just the laptop Mac computers.

<br>

		<div class="post-content">&nbsp;

If there&#8217;s a sweet spot when it comes to memory upgrades, it is upgrading your memory from 2GB to 4Gb when it comes to [Mac Memory Upgrades][1].MacBook Models from Apple are just one of many notebook computers to take advantage of a 4GB Memory Upgrade from 2GB.

**[Best 4GB RAM Memory][2]**

At 2gb of RAM, what once was considered a very capable amount of memory, in 2011 this amount of memory is at very least standard with your Mac or should  be. When running a current operating system such as I am here as I write this article in wordpress, and with just a few other applications open such as Mail, iTunes, Safari and iPhoto, I am currently using 3GB of the 4GB of RAM (and in my case, this is the maximum RAM for my MacBook Pro. Only 25% of the memory I have installed is free when running Mac OS X, version 10.6.6 and a few Apple Applications running and with open windows.

So, as you can see 2gB of RAM is nice, but 4GB of RAM is better. For some,8GB of memory and higher will be out of reach due to either limitations of the Mac&#8217;s maximum memory allowed or even just their pocketbook &#8211; 8GB of memory and higher could be too much ram.

But with 4GB of RAM installed you have at very minimum enough RAM to run a current Mac operating system and still have enough memory to have a few Apple applications running and a few windows open. If you don&#8217;t have enough RAM and the  2GB you have installed is not  enough ram to run the computing tasks you need, the OS uses the hard disk for temporary memory storage. This is becoming less of an issue thanks due to the popularity of SSD hard drives and as these newer flash based hard drives gain in popularity they will also drop in price too.

But there&#8217;s no such thing as having too much RAM and for most computing tasks that are common in everyday use, 4gb of RAM is a good balance of enough ram for those on a budget when considering RAM upgrades.

Below you will find the latest and current ram prices for 4gb RAM for all currently shipping Apple Computer models:

Four memory upgrade slots are available for uprading the 2010 iMacs in either 4GB, 8GB or 16GB memory configurations, depending on your computing budget, as the Apple iMac is a consumer desktop and we all have other costs besides memory upgrades to worry about.

But iMac RAM is cheap, compared to the benefits and length of time you will use and enjoy your Apple iMac you really should, if your budget allows upgrade your iMac with the most memory you can afford. When you do the math, your iMac RAM upgrade could be had for pennies a day.

**[Best MacBook Pro][2]**

But regardless of whether you currently own a MBP, or are in the market to buy your first MacBook Pro, you should considering adding or upgrading the RAM or Memory on your professional MacBook as adding memory is the best bang for your dollar when wanting to speed up your Mac for less.

The first step in adding RAM is to determine how much RAM you currently have installed in your Apple Computer and it&#8217;s pretty easy to determine this with just a few mouse clicks:

1. Go to the Apple Menu on the top left corner of your screen  
2. Choose About This Mac  
3. You will be presented with a window that looks something like this:  
[<img class="size-full wp-image-718 alignnone" title="MacBook Pro RAM installed" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Screen-shot-2011-01-11-at-2.48.17-PM.png" alt="How much RAM installed in MacBook Pro" width="303" height="376" />][3]

In the case of the image above this information pertains to my 2008 MacBook Pro, and displays the processor speed and also how much RAM is installed. For this particular model, I&#8217;m already maxed out with RAM at 4GB, but if you are wanting to upgrade a currently shipping MacBook Pro, you should add more RAM as these models can accept and run 8GB of RAM for MacBook Pros.

16GB is not yet available at time of this article but it&#8217;s my guess that the next refresh or even replacement of the MacBook Pro will lead to a maximum allowance of 16GB memory. There was a time not too long ago that my 4GB of RAM installed was a costly and capable amount of memory for Apple&#8217;s professional notebook computer.

Once you have determined how much RAM is already installed, all you need to do is [buy RAM][4] from an trusted memory store to upgrade your MacBook Pro to its maximum performance potential.

<br>

		<div class="post-content">When shopping for the [best Mac RAM upgrades][1], regardless of what specific Mac computer you have there&#8217;s a very good chance you will be shopping for DDR SDRAM, as this specific memory upgrade type has been in circulation for close to a decade, if not longer.

Today&#8217;s popular **DDR SDRAM Memory Upgrades** for Mac all tend to be  from the DDR3 family running at speeds of up to 1333Mhz and with capacities of 8GB in size for each DDR3 memory upgrade chip which for upgrading an Apple Mac computer in 2011 means you could, if you have very deep pockets &#8211; install up to 64GB of RAM in an Apple Mac Pro.

&nbsp;

Even though the DDR3 1333Mhz specification did not start to come onto the scene for Apple Memory Upgrades until the release of the 2010 iMac and Mac Pro models about halfway through the year, in the short time that they have been available, and especially when it comes to the larger Mac Pro Memory Upgrade Kits consisting of memory kits based on 8GB DDR3 1333Mhz memory modules, the prices have dropped at very least 30% in the past six months or so on DDR3 1333Mhz memory upgrades. Regardless of the DDR ram specification,  ram prices continue to drop over time. If you wait, you get a better deal on ram than if you are an early adopter and buy ram when the new DDR3 ram is used and recognized by Apple computers.

The other specification for Apple DDR3 SDRAM is the 1066Mhz speed, which obviously does not run as fast as the 1333Mhz RAM. With other speeds of DDR RAM, you might be able to get away with buying the faster of the two memory upgrade speeds and the ram would gear down to the lower DDR MHz speed if need be. But this is not the case with the DDR3 1066 and DDR3 1333MHz. You cannot interchange the memory for your Mac. If your Apple requires the faster DDR3 RAM, you need to buy the right DDR SDRAM for your Apple Computer Model.

To make things a bit easier for you to determine what RAM you need, here are the current ram prices for currently shipping Apple computer models:

I recently switched from over a decade of using a Mac every day to using a PC notebook. Why? I find that most of my use for my notebook is email and writing and all of this can be done in any browser window. I prefer Chrome from Google as when I compare my open windows from Mac to PC there&#8217;s not much difference between a[ $2000 MacBook  Pro][1] and a[ $500 PC notebook. ][2]

**Security Programs for PC NoteBooks vs Mac Laptops **

One area where I really was unprepared was when it comes to security software. This is one area where the Mac just shines and that&#8217;s with viruses &#8211;  or the  lack thereof I have experienced on an Apple notebook in all the years I have been using Apple computers.  Compare to a PC, where you need to buy an antivirus program from the moment you turn on your PC and this left me asking what is the best Antivirus software in 2012?

**Free Antivirus Software from Microsoft. **

One solution for Windows 7 Antivirus software is to download the free **[Microsoft Security Essentials][3]. **I know there are other antivirus and security options out there. Some free, like [AVG][4] and some that will cost you a few dollars from [McAfee][5], [Kaperksy ][6]and [Norton ][5]to name a few, but I figure who would know more about protecting their products more? The folks that made the software you want to protect or  some third party antivirus software company?

In my books it makes perfect sense to trust Microsoft for my Antivirus needs.  I guess it all depends on what you need form  an Antivirus program and from my research that some software excels where others fail, but Microsoft Security essentials meets my needs for one reason: It&#8217;s free antivirus software.  I swear, the the older I get  &#8211; the cheaper  I get and the thought of  having to pay over $100 for some software to protect my PC that&#8217;s not worth much more than that in total hardware costs just does not make sense to me.

**Free Antivirus Software That Works**

But just because this free software to protect your PC does not  mean it&#8217;s no good. Take a look at the feature set for the 2012 version of Microsoft Security Essentials:

Real Time Protection of your PC from spyware, viruses and other malware (malicious software &#8211; that&#8217;s a fancy term for software that  is up to no good)

System Cleaning automatically quarantines any questionable files on your PC it finds and notifies you of the potential threat.

System Scanning does just what it says it does and scans your system for any viruses you may already have on your Windows PC but not know  it.

Automatic Firewall Protection. The firewall settings can be tricky  to navigate for  the average PC user like me  and  the MSE takes care of all that  technical stuff for me.

Rootkit protection sounds complicated, and this is just one more thing that  the free antivirus software from Microsoft takes care of for me and it&#8217;s sophisticated enough  to recognize the good software from the bad that could  harm your PC.

And this is the part that I was really impressed with &#8211; Microsoft Essentials takes care of the network protection as  I am totally lost when it comes to protecting other computers on my home network. I am  happy to hand this task off to Microsoft.

**Why is  this antivirus software for Windows 7 Free? **

Microsoft could have charged for this &#8211; and charged  a pretty competitive price too. Others that offer free antivirus usually are really fremium where the whole point is to nag you to death until you cave and buy their full featured software and thus, the income stream.  I think Microsoft offers this antivirus software for free is for goodwill.

Think about it : If this free software keeps your Windows 7 PC running smoothly and trouble free you are more likely to think that Windows is overall is a better value, and  over time you will continue to buy more Windows PCs allowing  Microsoft to sell more software. You may win short term,  but in  the end Microsoft gets to keep you as a loyal customer which is something they value more than any $20 profit on anivirus software.

Have a look at **[Microsoft Security Essentials][3]**. MSE download is free,  so this all costs you nothing but the time to install Microsoft Essentials download. This is one of the best software available today for keeping your PC virus free for free.  It&#8217;s working fine for me.
