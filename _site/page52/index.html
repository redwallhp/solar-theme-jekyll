<p><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_Pro_KITS_(1066_DDR3)-8gb/" title="macbook pro 8gB">8GB Memory MacBook Pro</a> prices are much more reasonable in price currently than they have been in the past.  In the past to upgrade your Apple MacBook Pro with 8gb of ram would have cost the same as a new macbook with memory prices for macbook pro being almost 1000 dollars you have to have deep, deep pockets to upgrade your macbook pro to 8GB total and unless you we doing high intensity work that required the most ram for whatever the cost such as photoshop or image editing or working with movies whether it be final cut or iMovie you might be inclined to stick with the stock ram in your mbp as upgrading  to 8GB MacBook Pro Memory sure was pricey.</p>

<p>That was then and this is now and for a few reasons, it makes a lot more sense to buy ram for your macbook pro. Especially now, with the back to school season and soon after the holiday shopping for 2010 season upon us sooner than we’d like it might make sense to upgrade with 8GB ram now.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MX5YWI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001MX5YWI">Cheap 8GB MacBook Pro RAM</a></strong></p>

<p>It’s always been my thought – and this applies to all memory upgrades whether it’s for apple notebooks or desktops is to max out the ram.  Adding the maximum ram  to your MacBook Pro means you only pay once for memory upgrades and then you’re done. My current computer is a macbook pro personally and I coughed up $100 (yes, I buy ram just like you) and maxed out my macbook pro and it just works. It will be close to two years with the same computer so my memory upgrade cost me about  $4 a month over the two years. That’s the same price as a fancy cup of coffee.  I have forgotten about my memory upgrade since as I bought my ram from a reputable memory vendor that sells quality ram built to apple specifications but without the extra price you can  sometimes pay when shopping for ram from Apple directly.</p>

<p>8GB of RAM is the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="most ram installed">most ram you can currently install</a> into a MacBook Pro and I suggest you do just that. As I write this 8GB will set you back about  $250 or so from many vendors for the 8GB MacBook Pro memory kits. Not the cheapest ram you can buy, no. $250 would buy a lot of cool apple toys like an ipod, or iphone or some other apple software or accessor but it won’t let you get your work done faster. We’re going to assume you’re a pro as you bought  the pro macbook for the extra features so you could benefit from bigger display, more speed , etc and you paid a pretty penny to do so. It only makes sense to squeeze the most you can out of your MacBook Pro and  install the maximum ram you can too. I bet if you’re making a living or even freelancing part time you’ll make the money back that you spent to buy 8GB Memory MacBook Pro in no time.</p>

<p>When you consider adding ram to a computer there’s a lot more to ask yourself  rather than just what’s the best memory deal I can get?  In fact, I have found that the best ram prices have very little to do with what you need when you consider<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="buy memory"> buying more memory</a> for your Apple or PC computer.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-4.28.41-PM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1360" title="Best Toshiba Laptop" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-4.28.41-PM.png" alt="Cheap Toshiba Notebook" width="643" height="429" /></a></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004G8QQ2I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004G8QQ2I">Cheap Toshiba Notebook Computers</a></strong></p>

<p>It doesn’t matter whether you have the latest computer or even a brand new computer you should  always  buy new ram not used memory. Yes, you can save money when you buy ram but you have absoltutely no gaurantee on the memory preformance. It’s quite possible you could damage your computer with used ram and that’s why I always recommend you start your search for memory here. I have been listing and tracking the best prices on ram from the best memory stores for longer than I care to share. Ok , since you asked I  have thirteen years experience with ram and memory upgrades and I have saved thousands of people just like you money on new computer ram upgrades from manufacturers like Apple, Dell, HP and Compaq. I guess I should also list<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/pc/" title="sony ram"> Sony RAM</a> and Toshiba memory too. You can get a great deal on ram when you shop for ram online.</p>

<p>I mean really, if the memory is designed to work and and is compatible with  both Macintosh and  Windows OS (or operating systems as they are sometimes called) does it matter where you bought the memory.</p>

<p>I can understand why you would  want to buy an apple computer as they offer good design and relatively and arguable affordability. The new Macs – and I mean all of them from <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/iMac_(DDR3_1333)/" title="imac ram memory">iMac</a> to <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_Pro_KITS_(1066_DDR3)/" title="macbook pro memory">MacBook Pros </a>to<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/Mac_Pro_(DDR3_1066)/" title="mac pro memory"> Mac Pros</a> they all offer value and that’s why they are the best selling computers today when you factor in ease of use and lack of viruses when all you want to do is surf the web and get some work done.</p>

<p>Maybe your’e here because you heard or read somewhere that the easiest computer upgrade you can do is to add ram or memory and  it’s true. RAM is so cheap these days.</p>

<p>I remember when I started to look  for the best deals on RAM and this is a time when even 1GB of RAM for a computer was astounding and a store online started to carry and sell 1GB RAM and I had to check with the store to be sure they hadn’t made a price mistake as the 1 GB of ram at the time was priced  at $2500. Wow, those were the days.</p>

<p>Fast forward to today where you  would  have a hard time even spending $2500 on an entire computer, let alone an upgrade for the computer. We’ve come a long way, baby – like the old cigarette ads used to say (I’m dating myself here)</p>

<p>But now it’s 2010 and all you wan to know is how much is memory? What does RAM cost ? Is there a gaurantee?  Does the RAM come with free shipping? How long has the memory store been in business. Is my credit card data with the memory store secure?</p>

<p>If you don’t ask all these questions when you are looking for the best price on ram and memory upgrades you should be. It’s your hard earned money you’re spending and lots of memory companies want to sell you ram so they can stay in business and profit.</p>

<p>You wan to save money on RAM which is why you searched for “what is the price to add ram to a computer” in  the first place. If you didn’t care you would just call dell or apple or  toshiba or wherever and pay full price or even more than full price for ram.</p>

<p>But if you do your homework you can not only save money on memory upgrades you can sleep better at night knowing you did the work and didn’t spend all your money on RAM when you have other expenses.</p>

<p>The good news is you are here and you want to know the price for computer upgrades and let me tell you, you’ve come to the right place. Where else can you buy ram from a selection of memory store that all offer the  best ram prices in some way. You’ll notice I didn’t say the lowest ram prices because you must consider other factors when buying ram such as frees shipping and customer service and all those other factors to consider when buying memory upgrades that I listed further up this article.</p>

<p>But if price is your main concern for modern computers in 2010 regardless of make or model they all pretty much can benefit for a DDR3 1066 or sometimes DDR3 1333 ram upgrade. Yes, there’s still a bit of demand for older memory chips as some schools and  cheap business (cheap people too) used older computers and are looking to squeeze every last drop of performance out of their computing dollar and a memory upgrade does just that. Dollar for dollar a ram upgrade is the best upgrade you can do for your desktop or notebook computer today.</p>

<p>Right, price.  ram prices change so much over time by the time I hit publish the ram prices will be old news and new ram modules will have become available. What usually happens is this: new ram is made. it’s pricey as it’s expensive. An example would be the 1GB ram when it first came on the market. You had to have very deep pockets to afford  1GB of ram a decade or so ago. We are seeing the same with newer ram modules too. 8GB for your iMac or MacBook Pro  if you’re an Apple fan is not cheap. Yet.</p>

<p>Notice that I said: Yet. The ram prices for expensive ram will drop and drop and drop until the demand  lowers and then the prices for ram for your older computer by this time will actually increase a bit as the demand has dropped so the prices have to rise.</p>

<p>But as I write this, I find that spending $100 or even less on memory upgrades will allow you get the maximum performance out of your computer and the price to add ram to you computer rarely exceeds the $100 price for most modern computers today.  There are a few exceptions to this rule as some of the professional computers need  more expensive memory. This makes sense in my thinking – if you are making a living with your computer you should expect to pay more for a memory upgrade than grandma who is just emailing the grand children on her netbook.</p>

<p>Regardless, RAM prices are cheap and I fully endorse that you should upgrade ram to the fullest and maximum you can afford for memory upgrades</p>

<p>I wish <a href="http://www.apple.com" title="apple">Apple</a> would release their models yearly instead of the way they do because after a while when you go to look up your iMac model you almost need a PHD to figure out what model of iMac you have and if you’re upgrading what iMac RAM or Memory you need to buy.  They do much better with  their releases of their phones which seem  to come out yearly now and the naming is a little easier to understand the iPhone 3 was in ’08 and then came the iPhone 3GS and lastly even with all it’s antenna problems has been named the iPhone 4.  Somewhere it makes sense to just upgrade the innards and keep it all the same as far as computer names but it sure was a lot easier when there was only one iMac, not many many different Apple iMac Models from which to choose.</p>

<p>Rant over,  Apple released new Apple iMac models earlier this week and I have already found some stores that carry <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/iMac_(DDR3_1333)/" title="Imac RAM">iMac RAM</a>. Its’ still early days but the stores that are the price leaders usually don’t cater to Apple Memory per se,  but carry computer memory for all types of RAM and not just Apple.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>[table id=2 /]</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8IO6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8IO6"><img title="IMac Deals" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-4.34.06-PM.png" alt="Best iMac Price" width="544" height="412" /></a></p>

<p>But those that are more in tune with the Apple market and Apple community tend  to get their Apple RAM listed first as they can do it  themselves and updated their pages to add apple iMac memory. Heck, one store even sent  me a press release saying  that they now carried the Apple iMac Memory for the new Apple iMac  2010. I’m going to call it that I think because this really is new and  released just in time for those wanting to buy a new Apple Computer for back to school or the Christmas holiday shopping season. Apple even has a deal now where if you buy a mac you get a free iPod too.</p>

<p>But, we’re here today to talk about RAM for the new iMacs.  As always I am  relectunt to tell you to buy from one specific memory store because it’s your money not  mine. But I can tell you that Crucial Technology, Other World Computing, Data Memory Systems and RAMJET all offer ram for the new iMacs in stock and ready to ship.</p>

<p>This ram is new to the Apple lineup and the first to include the DDR3 1333MHZ specification, so all or any memory you have from older Apple iMacs won’t work in the new Apple iMac models. You’ll have to buy new ram upgrades to upgrade the new Apple iMacs.</p>

<p>The other good news with  the release of  the summer 2010 iMacs  is they can accept more ram  – up to 16gb if your budget allows for it as there’s four memory slots on each of the new Apple iMacs and each slot can take 4GB of RAM.  So you could have 4GB, 8GB or 16GB memory upgrade configurations on the new iMacs.</p>

<p>Where do you buy the best 4GB RAM for MacBook?</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000K1KTNW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000K1KTNW">Cheap MacBook RAM</a></strong></p>

<p>That’s a very good question but it comes down to what you think best means. You might be looking for the lowest price on 4GB for MacBook or you might want to buy ram for macbook that can get to you the fastest as possible with overnight delivery and free shipping too if you can swing it. I have found to get free shipping on ram you have to spend $100 as a minimum  and unless you buy two 4GB ram for macbook or more you may not qualify for frees shipping when buying ram.</p>

<p>But then there’s another question:  what macbook? And you  can’t specify just ‘white macbook’ or even ‘black macbook’ as even with those two choices, it does specify things a bit and your macbook ram choices are narrowed down but that’s still not enough really. One way to figure out what type of ram you need is to go to the top left corner of your macbook pro and select ‘about this mac’ where you’ll see that the info provided will provide you with the speed of your computer  memory which might be helpful.</p>

<p>For a long time the macbooks  couldn’t take  or accept 4GB  RAM as they maxed out at 2gb of RAM with 2x1GB PC5300 DDR so-dimms for macbook being the only and biggest ram memory upgrades you could get. Then over the years memory for MacBooks got cheaper and it was found that some of the macbooks would acceptt 3GB of Macbook RAM with  a 1GB ram chip in one slot  and  a 2GB memory chip in the other.</p>

<p>And for a while that was the biggest macbook memory you could get.  But time marches on and  Apple released newer macbooks that shipped standard from the factory with <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_(1066_DDR3)-2gb/" title="2gb macbook ram">2GB of MacBook </a>RAM but you could pull the 2x1gB macbook memory and make keychains out of it or sell the ram on craigslist to offset the costs you could then take your  new found wealth and buy 2x2GB of RAM which  made your macbook run faster and would help you get to the the best <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_KITS_(1066_DDR3)/" title="best 4gb ram macbook">4GB of RAM for MacBook. </a></p>

<p>Fast forward to today, and there’s been a few speed bumps and some cosmetic changes to the Apple MacBook but for the most part it still looks and feels the same as the older macbook computers but these new macbooks  due to the faster processors  all used DDR3 1066 memory and the latest and greatest macbooks  still only accept 4GB of ram at most  and like all the others will require you to remove or replace the 2x1GB RAM chips and replace them with 2x 2GB Macbook RAM which will give you 4GB of RAM.</p>

<p>So now you know the history of the MacBook and how over time you could double the macbook ram from 2gb to 4gb you still cannot put 8GB  of RAM  into a MacBook and for that you’ll need to buy a MacBook  Pro which is much more expensive than a MacBook but offers a few advantages too  – one being the 8GB memory maximum for MacBook Pro .</p>

<p>The<strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="best 4gb ram for macbook"> best 4GB RAM for MacBook</a></strong> is when you buy ram from reputable memory stores that offer great prices and also a great prices on ram for MacBooks too.  Just remember to shop for RAM for MacBooks from a store that you can trust.</p>

<p>Ram Prices for 8GB RAM for MacBook Pro will, and do change over time. When you look or serarch  for 8 gigabytes of computer memory to to go inside or to be installed into a MacBook Pro you’r  really looking for 2x4GB memory modules because at the time of writing 8GB can only be installed in the newer MacBook Pro models from Apple and not all.</p>

<p>You can take the easy way out and<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="buy 8GB RAM"> buy 8GB of RAM</a> directly from Apple, but usually – and they’ve come a long way in the past few years  – yo will usually end up paying more for the MacBook RAM when you pick it up  from Apple. I’m not you so I don’t know and for you you might be worthwhile when you wan to Buy a MacBook Pro you don’t want to jerk around with having to buy your Mac from Apple and then your apple ram from another memory supplier or store. I get that. I’m a big fan of easy.</p>

<p>But how hard can it be? Order the MacBook  from whomever,  but buy your memory from a memory store you can trust. It just so happens that I  know a few stores that are reputable where you can get a pretty good deal on MacBook Pro memory.  Over the years I have personally used every vendors ram that I list without problem. In fact back in about 98 ( I know, you were 8) there was some sort of kerfuffle about some macs not recognizing the RAM and the Mac Web was all uptight – what if their memory didn’t work?  Nobody knew and nobody  bothered to pick up the phone  and ask: If I have ram trouble with your memory, then what happens? Such a simple question so I picked up the phone ( land line back in the day)  and called every memory store. Every store but one said without a doubt they fully guarantee the ram they sell and would replace it. Every single store. Not suprisingly, the memory store that didn’t gaurantee their stuff is long long out of business and  in fact, they let their domain name expire and a very nice gentleman in Montreal now runs  a memory store  and yes, he will guarantee the memory he sells.</p>

<p>So if you do need 8G RAM – buy ram from a store you can trust and be happy knowing that your MacBook Pro will run just fine and if in the small chance there is a problem that the memory is guaranteed.</p>

<p>Good question and first we need to understand one thing about memory and MacBook Pro Memory before we go there research the best price you can get on ram for MacBook Pros. The fact is, that if you chart it over time MacBook Pro RAM gets cheaper and cheaper. It wasn’t too long ago that the only MacBook Pro was the new unibody 17 inch MacBook Pro and yes you could finally install  8GB of memory into a MacBook Pro but you would need a lot of money to do so, to the  tune of over a thousand dollars.</p>

<p>Now, unless you’re NASA or some goverment  agency  or some business that rakes in hundreds of thousands of dollars each day,  you do not need a whole lot of RAM. And one thousand dollars for RAM upgrades is just well, silly. But that’s just one guys opinion, it’s bad enough I spent over $2000 on a MacBook Pro – the last thing my budget needs is another thousand dollars to spend on RAM.</p>

<p><strong>Cheaper MacBook Pro Memory</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I"><img title="Cheapest MacBook Pro" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-4.36.30-PM.png" alt="Cheap 2011 MacBook Pro" width="508" height="353" /></a></p>

<p>Thankfully, like a lot of things in life – the longer you wait the cheaper it gets. Especially with technology. Just like there’s now $100 iPhones, and $300 netbook computers you will soon be able to buy cheaper RAM for MacBooks too. Look at the Apple iPod. It had a crappy black and white screen, was as big as a house and only held 1000 songs. There was no way to upgrade the memory on the Apple iPods so you had to wait. Wait until Apple released cheaper iPods that would offer more storage and brighters screens, and now you can find cheap MP3 players for about the same amount of change you’d find in your seat cushions.</p>

<p>All this to say:<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="apple ram"> Apple RAM</a> or any memory upgrade gets cheaper over time. The big question becomes:  can you wait that long? Can you wait until the ram prices drop so you can get the best deal possible on MacBook Pro RAM? That’s really the biggest question. What’s your time worth? If you spend more and more time waiting than you do working then a ram upgrade is worth the price whatever it costs. But if all you are using your  Apple MacBook Pro for is for surfing the internet and email your MacBook Pro probably came with enough RAM right out of  the box.</p>

<p>But you want to upgrade your memory on your Mac, and you just want to know what the price range of MacBook RAM is, for crying  out loud. OK, OK I have rambled on long enough. As I write this the best price you get on  <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_Pro_(1066_DDR3)-2gb/" title="2gb macbook pro ram">MacBook Pro 2GB RAM memory modules are about $50 each</a> and to upgrade to the larger <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_Pro_(1066_DDR3)-4gb/" title="macbook pro 4gb ram">4GB RAM for MacBooks</a>, you will have to shell out about &amp;$150 each.  Prices on RAM change so if you’re reading this in the future these ram prices might not be applicable.</p>

<p>RAM Prices for MacBook Pros sure have dropped. You can max out the RAM on your MacBook Pro for about $300 now.  A year ago it would have cost you double that for the very same ram.  In another post I’ll show you how to get the cheapest RAM prices for MacBook Pros and  it’s pretty easy to do if you’ve done some frugal ram shopping.</p>

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>[table id=15 /]</p>

<p><strong>The best Apple  MacBook Pro 2011 RAM</strong>, or memory as it’s also know is the RAM that meets your specific MacBook Pro’s requirements. Frankly, if you buy pretty much any  ram that’s specified for your MacBook Pro and the thing boots up  – you’re good.<strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I">Best MacBook Pro Price</a></strong></p>

<p>There was one time many many years ago when all memory wasn’t the same and a lot of stores will try to get you to believe their ram is the best ram in the entire world but when it comes down to buttons and  brass tacks, all ram is pretty much the same as long as it’s tested and built to you specific Apple MacBook Pro memory requirements.</p>

<p>**But what’s the difference in MacBook Pro RAM? **</p>

<p>Customer service in my opinion. Is it easy to order online? Is your credit card secure when you place your order for MacBook Pro memory?</p>

<p>How about knowledge of the products they sell? Some memory stores are more interested in the lowest memory prices, and make up for any losses in sheer volume. Other memory sellers would much prefer a higher end customer that places an order for hundreds of quality ram parts all at once and so they market to those customers and go after the big corporate and school memory sales. Schools, especially can’t afford to upgrade their Macs every year- especially in this sour economy and budget cuts so what they do is upgrade the ram for every computer in the school. That’s a pretty big memory order and can make or break a memory store’s bottom line.</p>

<p>But all you came here for was the best deal on the best RAM for your MacBook Pro. You love how the keyboard feels on your MacBook Pro, and how that 13 inch or 15 inch MacBook Screen is bright and all the free iApps that Apple included pretty much get every user  up and running with word processing, web browsing and email right out of the box. But now you just want to increase the MacBook Pro’s performance and get the best deal on  RAM as money is money, and the economy sucks and heck,  you might not even know if you’ll have a job next week so saving money on anything you buy, MacBook Cases, RAM or hard drive. All you know is you need RAM. Maybe you read a Mac Blog or the guy at the Apple Store told you you should upgrade your ram to get the most out of your MacBook Pro it doesn’t matter how you ended up sitting in front of your computer and  searching for the best value MacBook RAM,  you’re here and you want to know one thing and one thing only :</p>

<p>**What’s the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_Pro_KITS_(1066_DDR3)/" title="best ram for macbook pro">Best RAM for MacBook Pro</a>? **</p>

<p>I think you’ll find the best RAM for MacBook Pro  from a number of memory stores, and yes even Apple Store is you’re so inlined.. You’ll pay a bit more for it, and it’s a big pain booking an appointment at the Genius bar but at least you’ll be feeling the Apple vibe while you wait in line to get your MacBook fixed because the RAM doesn’t work.  Or, you could buy RAM form a list of Apple Memory stores that have been in business for over a decade and specialize  in nothing but RAM for your new or old MacBook Pro, and other macs too – iMacs, Mac Minis, Mac Pros, even those PC’s  you mac fans love to hate: Dell Memory, Toshiba RAM, Sony Memory – it doesn’t matter  as they are all very very reputable online memory stores that do nothing  but specialize in <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="apple memory upgrades">Memory Upgrades for Apple</a>.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2010/07/8gb-macbook-pro-ram-prices/">8GB MacBook Pro RAM Prices</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I">Cheapest MacBook Pro Deal</a></strong></p>

<p>Where to Buy 8GB of RAM? Well, that depends. If you want the lowest price you can find for Apple MacBook Memory you should scoot over  the the front page of ramseeker  and use my handy-dandy memory configurator  I’ve whipped up for you to useThe latest MacBook Models from Apple can now accept up to 8GB of ram which is quite a significant jump from the 4gb maximum of even a year or so ago. Why the increase of MacBook Pro memory 8GB. One factor that shouldn’t be overlooked is price. <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="ram prices drop">ram prices drop</a> over time and  at one point not too long ago you would have to pay a lot more money to get 8gb of RAM into any Apple Mac, not just the MacBooks and MacBook Pros. For a long time, the only Apple Computers that would accept more than 8GB of RAM were Mac Pro Models and even they maxed out at 32gb.</p>

<div>
</div>

<p>Let me explain a bit on how I categorize the Apple Memory into Groups. Long, long ago when I started I only had to worry about listing a few ram prices for popular Macs. This was back in the day of the PowerMac G3’s and  even 32mb would set you back a pretty penny. 1GB of ram would cost over $1000 and so it was pretty simple as I only had a few pages to keep track of all the memory  that I do here on ramseeker.</p>

<p>But then, Apple couldn’t leave well enough alone. Nope,  they had to come out with  new models all the time. First, the iBooks came out and then a bit later the MacBooks and MacBook Pros (an aside:  I never cared for my black macbook I used to have – it showed the fingerprints too easy). So I added more pages to <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="ramseeker">ramseeker</a>, and more and more memory stores and started a discontinued section for all the Apple Models that were, well – discontinued.</p>

<p>That’s all fine and dandy but then about  2003 or so, Apple changed the specifications on some of their Macs where you had to buy the memory in matched pairs –  0r memory upgrade kits – as I call them. And it seems as some memory stores started to list their memory upgrades for the Mac as memory upgrade kits and some other  – nope, they stuck to their guns and still listed all their memory upgrades as individual modules.</p>

<p>That’s fine, but how can I differentiate? I can’t list both memory kits for the MacBook Pro  and Memory Modules for the MacBook Pros on the same page as that wouldn’t be fair. When you go to sort by price when comparing ram prices the module prices would always show first, and then the memory upgrade KITs would come next, and that’s no good. So what I did was make two pages. One for MacBook Pro – single  module and another page for MacBook Pro KIT, including the 8GB Memory Kits that are such a good deal these days.</p>

<p>But it’s still a bit confusing when shopping for 8GB MacBook Kits as the older MacBook Pros accepted PC5300 DR2 SO -DIMMS but the newer MacBook Pro Models took the DDR3 1066 MHZ so there’s that to differntiate from too when MacBook Pro Memory Shopping.</p>

<p>But  here’ what you need. You need MacBook Pro DDR3 1066 ram prices, and check both the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_Pro_KITS_(1066_DDR3)/" title="Apple MacBook Pro Memory Kits">MacBook Pro Memory upgrade kits </a>and the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_Pro_(1066_DDR3)/" title="macbook pro memory modules">MacBook Pro memory modules</a> to0,as you never know who has the best deal on ram, and you shouldn’t discount the guys who choose to sell their ram individually instead of a package deal</p>

<p>Do your homework and  you’ll get the best deal you can on 8GB MacBook Pro RAM Prices.</p>

<p>When you are in need of memory for computer – and this applies to all types of computers regardess of  computer maker or model – there are a few things to consider before you call your local computer shop, buy memory online or start to search eBay for your computer memory needs.</p>

<p><a href="&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1375" title="Best Apple Computer Memory" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-8.22.30-PM.png" alt="Cheap Computer RAM" width="542" height="285" /></a></p>

<p><strong><a href="&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW">Cheap Computer Memory</a></strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Price</strong>. Is the computer memory you are interested in for you particular computer priced competitively? You’re going to get a much better deal on your computer memory if you buy it from a third party memory store that specializes in memory for Apple for an example than if you buy the memory from Apple directly (although in recent times Apple memory from the Apple Store is getting more competitive)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Compatibility</strong>. Will the memory you want work in your computer without issue? Have all the manufacturer’s memory specifications been met so that when you go to install the memory you will be sure that the computer memory you bought works with your computer. Memory is fragile and susceptible to  damage from static electricity.  Installing bad ram could mean your computer does not run smoothly or even not at all after you installed bad ram.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Customer service</strong>. If your main objective is number 1 above, price, you may have to be wiling to be sacrifice customer service for price. Are you willing to make that sacrifice. Personally  I am not and  would much rather buy my ram from a memory store I know and trust. Better yet if the store specializes in nothing but memory.  If you make your living with your computer, ask yourself how much your time is worth. Do you have th time and patience  and are willing to sacrifice the potential of lost income, just because your memory failed due to the fact that you bought cheap ram from a questionable price.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The good news is you can buy ram with confidence and get numbers 1,2 and 3 when you buy the memory from one of the vendors I recommend. all and any of the memory stores you see on ramseeker have been in the comptuter memory business for over a decade and do nothing all day but to sell you the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="best memory best prices">best memory upgrades at the best price</a>.</p>

<p>Whatever your memory ugpgrade needs might be, you owe it to yourself to get the best deal on the beset ram at the best price with the least amount of time and aggravation.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that notebook computers seem to be outpacing the sales of desktop computers, there’s lots of times when buying a cheap desktop computer is a better deal than buying a cheap netbook, or laptop computer.</p>

<p>A desktop computer does indeed usually lack a handle to make it truly portable, but for the most part the desktop rises head and shoulders above the desktop computer for one reason that stands out in my mind and that’s expadability. The desktop computer usually has lots of room for <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="memory for desktops">memory upgrades</a>.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013FK9U2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0013FK9U2"><img title="Best Selling Apple Desktop" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-8.18.44-PM.png" alt="Cheap Desktop Computers" width="475" height="228" /></a></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013FK9U2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0013FK9U2">Apple Mac Mini. Best Selling Desktop Computer</a></strong></p>

<p>Desktop RAM is priced usually pretty much the same as notebook memory but the benefit of buying ram for your desktop is you can buy more ram  which in turn means more performance out of your desktop computer. Now if  all you use is a word processing document you don’t need to worry about speed as much as the computer is going to  be waiting on you to type. There’s a good chance that if all you use to compute is to do light email and web surfing and some data entry you don’t have to worry too much about computer speed. The computer, either desktop  or notebook will be waiting for you to finish typing. In the meantime, it just waits.</p>

<p>But, if you are a graphic designer, or  use  photo imaging tools such as photoshop or lightroom you’re going to need all the ram you can get your hands on, or at very least – all the memory you can afford to buy. Hard drives too but that’s another post all in itself.</p>

<p>You have your desktop computer and it’s too slow. You need to buy more ram. How much RAM you can add to your desktop will depend usually on the motherboard and how many memory upgrade slots are available. Can you install the memory in pairs?  Can you keep the the memory you have in the computer already, or will you need  to upgrade all your memory and replace the RAM you have? All these are good questions to ask and consider before you go looking to buy cheap ram for your desktop.</p>

<p>The good news is every memory store offers what is called as a memory configurator. It’s a pretty fancy term but all it does is help you find the the best ram you need at the best price. You usually enter  your computer brand,  or sometimes your motherboard type if the PC you want to upgrade is hand built by you or a custom PC store. The next thing the configurator does is ask you about the model of your computer</p>

<p>To find the model of your computer can sometimes be a bit tricky but it’s usually written on the back of your desktop computer or sometimes on the bottom if you have a notebook or  laptop. Once you have brand and model name of your computer a customized page on the memory store’s website is returned to you exlaining all you need to know about memory upgrade choices for your computer. Size of ram you need to get to the ram upgrade you want and whether you need to upgrade the memory in pairs, or if you can get away with just buying one memory module at a time.</p>

<p>Somes stores even offer different choices in quality: You can chose to buy more expensive but with higher quality parts – name brand memory. Or if your budget is tight and you just want to buy the cheapest ram you can find then they offer that too.</p>

<p>Buying cheap ram whether in desktop form or a notebook is not hard and you’ll get the best price on ram if you compare prices on ram  from a selection of stores as all memory stores offer different prices for their desktop memory. Take your time, find your desktop computer brand and model name and find a memory store you can trust and use their memory configurator to get the beat deal on desktop ram..</p>
