That&#8217;s great that you need the best ram upgrade for iMac but the very first thing we need to do is figure out which apple iMac you use. Maybe you already know this as some apple  fans and websites have a lot of knowledge about all the different types of iMacs and not just ram so if you&#8217;ve come with the knowledge of what ram you need for your particular iMac feel free to skip ahead and start to [shop for iMac Memory now][1].  
I track and monitor memory prices on a whole bunch of different iMacs over the years and Apple has this annoying  habit of just calling the iMac &#8216;iMac&#8217; regardless of year or design. They&#8217;re all just iMacs according to Apple and the latest is the &#8216;iMac&#8217; model that was just released. This has been called different names to differentiate between the older models. I have seen the new iMac as iMac Summer 2010 or iMac mid July or if you&#8217;re me I classify the Apple iMacs by ram types they use.If you&#8217;re looking for the **[best ram upgrade for iMac ][2]**you&#8217;ve definitely come to the right place.

**[Best Apple iMac Prices][3]**

But for the rest of us: a little lesson on how to find out what  iMac you have, or at very least I want to help you figure out what RAM you need for iMacs. Here&#8217;s how and this technique will work not only with iMacs but with  MacBooks or any other apple computer too.

Go to your apple menu in the left hand corner.

Select: About this Mac

Up comes a window that tells you how much RAM you have and how to see what RAM  you need.

Here&#8217;s mine: It&#8217;s a MacBook. I know this because apple has screen printed it right on the screen for me to see &#8211; nice and handy.

&nbsp;

It will show the processor speed. This is good and in my case I have a MacBook Pro 2.4Ghz. I&#8217;ll write this down.

Then I see I have 4GB of RAM installed already (which is the maximum already). And this ram runs at 1067mhz., which is real close to the 1066Mhz RAM I need to buy ( apple rounds up the speed of the memory. My macbook pro ram runs at 1066.6 Mhz , so apple calls it close enough to 1067MHz)

In my case I know know I have a MacBook Pro 2.4GHz and it runs at 1066Mhz, so if I were to shop for ram for my macbook  I would want to buy MacBook Pro 1066Mhz RAM

And that&#8217;s all there is to it to find out how much ram  you have. If you need help figuring any of this out be sure to contact me and I&#8217;ll be happy to help you get the best RAM upgrade for your iMac or any computer.

		<div class="post-content">**[Cheap MacBook Memory][1]**

It depends on which particular black macbook you have but you may be able to install up  to 6gb of RAM inside a black macbook. You would do this by installing one 4GB memory chip into one memory slot while with the other memory upgrade slot you install a 2 gb memory module.

The black MacBooks either max out at 2 GB of RAM or 4GB of Memory depending on what model you have. The later Apple MacBooks will run up to 6GB of memory unofficially, meaning that it&#8217;s not supported or documented by apple and some of the earlier models will recognize 3GB of RAM.

Personally, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s worth the bother to upgrade your Black MacBooks past what is recommended by Apple as I think you&#8217;re just asking for trouble. Just because you can, doesn&#8217;t mean you should.

The intel core duo black macbooks released in 2006 will max out at 2GB of  PC5300 DDR2 RAM.  You will need to buy [2x1GB PC5300 DDR sodimms ][2]to get the maximum RAM  for this black macbook model

The intel core 2 duo [black macbook models also max out with 2GB of RAM ][3]and the same  memory configuration is required: 2x1GB PC5300 DDR sodimms are needed to get the maximum ram

The intel core 2 duo black macbooks with the &#8216;santa rosa&#8217; processor will take more ram than the 2GB of predecessors and will recognize [4GB of ram by installing  2x2GB PC53000 DDR so-dimms. ][4]

the 2008 intel core 2 duo black macbook will also take 4GB by replacing the standard memory that came from the factory with[ 2x2GB 4GB memory upgrades for black macbook ][5]

So yes, you could squeeze either 3GB or 6GB into your black macbook depending on what particular black macbook model you have but it&#8217;s not something I can recommend. Some trusted memory vendors (OWC comes to mind) say that the larger memory will work just fine with the dark colored apple notebooks but I can&#8217;t recommend it and sleep at night.

But for the later black macbooks there&#8217;s no reason why you can&#8217;t[ install 4GB RAM for Black MacBook][6] and rest assured your black macbooks will run just fine with the ram maxed out at 4GB.

RAM prices drop over time. They just do. Especially for the latest and greatest memory for your apple, dell, sony or toshiba as these days all computer brands use the same memory types and sizes but over time ram prices drop:

Here&#8217;s an example for iMac Memory:

[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-212" title="ram prices drop over time" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2010-08-09-at-4.33.42-PM.png" alt="imac ram prices get cheaper" width="523" height="319" />][1]

Wild eh? (there&#8217;s my canadian showing). The iMac RAM (this particular graph is from 2008 data) dropped from $90 to $40 over the period of the year. That&#8217;s a resonable savings over the price of the year.

Can you afford to wait for ram prices to drop? Let&#8217;s pretend you make your living with your iMac, or any computer it doesn&#8217;t matter but you make money online with your computer. Maybe you&#8217;re a photographer who uses photoshop or a writer or maybe you just blog and hope to make a few bucks here and there.. it doesn&#8217;t really matter what computer you use or what you do to make money with your computer: my question to you is : what&#8217;s it worth to you to wait until ram prices drop?

About a year ago you would have to pay about 1000 dollars to upgrade your iMac to the maximum at the time. The Mac web went crazy! &#8216;what &#8211; they cried &#8211; that&#8217;s almost the sam price as the iMac!&#8217; What they didn&#8217;t realize that for some, even at $1000 for memory upgrades was still the bargain of the year.  If you&#8217;re making money with your computer either offline or  online it doesn&#8217;t matter the $1000 is the biggest bargain for memory if it means more work getting done easier and smoother.

A lot of people think that the lowest price on ram is so important, but if you make more than that with your skills, your computer and your maxed out memory  the price of the upgrade is really not an issue, especially when you amortize the ram costs over the time you own your computer. I&#8217;ve worked it out in other posts, but the ram for my MacBook Pro works out to about $4 a month. Pretty cheap ram if you ask me.

Granted, you could wait for ram prices to drop and as you see in the image above they do &#8211; and usually the ram prices drop pretty fast for newer models as more and more memory gets manufactured and  there&#8217;s more places to [buy ram and memory][2] for your new computer it only makes sense that demand will grow and prices will drop.

The question really is: Can you afford to wait for ram prices to drop, and not [when will ram prices come down][3]?

Wow. [8GB RAM for Apple MacBook Pros][1] sure have dropped over the past year or so. I think it was the fall of 2008 when the Unibody 17 inch MacBook Pro was released from Apple as it was the very first Apple MacBook Pro to accept and acknowledge 8GB of RAM Memory Upgrades.

[table id=1 /]

[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1336" title="Cheap MacBook Pro RAM" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-3.48.40-PM.png" alt="Best MacBook Pro Memory" width="313" height="293" />][2]

**[Cheap 8GB MacBook Pro RAM][2]**

With 8GB of RAM installed inside a MacBook Pro you could essentially use the MacBook Pro as a desktop replacement &#8211; especially the 17 inch version of the Apple MacBook Pros with it&#8217;s super big and bright LCD display you really didn&#8217;t need an external monitor or any other third party display (of course you could hook up the Apple MacBook Pros to an Apple Cinema Display and really benefit from the maxed out ram and you would have two displays to see all your work at a glance.)

But the downside of buying 8GB of RAM for MacBook Pros back then was the price. To buy 8GB of RAM for the Apple MacBook&#8217;s you&#8217;d have to fork over almost one thousand of your hard earned dollars to upgrade the ram in your macbook pro to the maximum ram avialable. Heck you could pretty much buy a macbook for the same price as some memory stores were charging for MacBook Pro RAM at the time.

But good things come to those who wait &#8211; especially in  the  technical or computer  industry where the rule is that the stuff gets faster and bigger while the price usually gets cheaper.  And for those looking to buy RAM or Memory that&#8217;s a good thing because now your MacBook Pro 8GB RAM Memory upgrade isn&#8217;t all that pricey &#8211; especially when you compare it to years past where you would have to pay a pretty hefty premium to be able to use and afford 8GB of Memory in a MacBook Pro.

As I check the latest [ram prices ][3]on ramseeker I find that at the time of writing,  I can grab 8GB of RAM from many memory stores that are trusted and recommended, such as other world computing, Memory X, 18004Memory, Data Memory Systems and Crucial Technology  &#8211; they all offer 8GB of RAM KITs for a pretty good deal &#8211; especially when you combine the 8GB RAM and install it in a new MacBook Pro (Spring 2010).  As I write this, the best price for 8GB of RAM for MacBook Pros go for about $250.00 which is a far cry from the $1000 or so you would pay just a year or so ago.

[MacBook Pro 8GB RAM][4] Prices sure have dropped over time.

Want to know a little secret? RAM for all current Apple Computers are all pretty much the same. So when you ask me: Hey, Jim &#8211; what&#8217;s the cheapest mac mini ram? you could also be asking about the cheapest macbook ram and macbook pro ram too.

&nbsp;

**[Cheapest Apple Mac Mini][1]**

Assuming of course, that your memory requirements are the same speed. ie: 1066MHz macbooks and macbook pro&#8217;s and  the newer mac mini&#8217;s all use the same ram. iMac too, until about a week or so ago when Apple released the new Apple iMacs &#8211; they use DDR3 1333 RAM Memory so you can&#8217;t swap it out with the other Mac models. Yet, anyway.  If Apple has released the new iMacs you can guess that the notebook computers will soon be using the 1333 MHz  speed too over time.

Anyway, you&#8217;re here because you want to know the cheapest Mac Mini RAM, and I&#8217;m happy to help but we need to know a few things first. Most important is what Mac Mini?  Some of earlier Mac Minis used DDR PC2700 SDRAM and then when the intel based Mac Minis came out for years they required the use of DDR2 PC5300 so-dimms and thing s pretty stayed the same for a year if not more and then finally apple released the Mac Mini&#8217;s that required the DDR3 1066MHz so-dimms and currently are the faster and most popular ram for Mac Mini computers.

How to find out how what ram you need for your specific Mac Mini is pretty easy:

Go to your Apple Menu in the top left corner of the screen and select &#8216;about this mac&#8217;. What comes up is a screen that shows you how much ram you have installed, and most importantly &#8211; what speed of RAM for your Apple Mac Mini you need to buy. Once you&#8217;ve got all this info you&#8217;re off to the races and you can see the [cheapest mac mini ram ][2]at a glance here on ramseeker:

Mac Mini Memory (PC2700DDR)

[Mac Mini Memory (PC5300 DDR) ][3]

[Mac Mini Memory KITS (PC5300 DDR) ][4]

[Mac Mini Memory (DDR3 1066) ][5]

[Mac Mini Memory (DDR3 1066 Memory Upgrade KITS)][6]

Use the links above and you will find the the cheapest mac mini ram from the 3rd party memory stores I list, (and have been listing for 13+ years now).

One last word of caution: I don&#8217;t think the Mac Mini RAM is supposed to be installed by a  &#8220;Apple Authorized Service Provider&#8221; At least the [older Mac Minis had this requirement][7] and I can&#8217;t see any reason why this would have changed.

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><div style="float: right; margin-right: 5px;">
</div>

**June 2012** &#8211; You can now, at long last install 16GB of RAM into a MacBook Pro into the Newest 2012 13 inch and 15 inch Apple MacBook Pro models, but if you want to buy the MacBook Pro with Retina Display you&#8217;re hosed when it comes to installing ram after purchase. Like the MacBook Air the ram on the soon to be best selling MacBook Pro is soldered to the motherboard and thus, unremovable and not able to accept an upgrade.

**September 2011.** [Crucial Technology][1] now carries [8GB DDR3 SODIMMS][2] at reasonable prices making the 16GB MacBook Pro RAM Upgrades affordable for professionals needing the most RAM possible for the Apple MacBook  Pro.

[table id=15 /]

**Update**:16GB RAM for MacBook Pro is now available from [OWC][3] and more memory vendors as time goes by. At the time I write this, 16GB MacBook Pro RAM is far from cheap and might cost more than the MacBook Pro you intend to install it in. Check here For [current MacBook Pro RAM 16GB prices][4]

**[8GB DDR3 for Apple MacBook Pro ][5]**

Two words: not yet.

For 16GB MacBook Pro RAM at the time being anyway. 8GB is the most memory you can  install in the MacBook Pros currently.  This will change I guarantee it. The question is: when? When will I be able to install and use MacBook Pro RAM that&#8217;s 16GB?

When did Apple release the last batch of MacBook Pros? Spring 2010, right? And just a week or so ago, Apple announced the new iMacs and they can easily use 16GB of RAM and are the first to do so ( Well,&#8230;OK, the Mac Pro&#8217;s too, soon enough).

But when will the MacBook Pros be able to use 16GB of Memory  (wow, I remember when 16MB was a lot of ram for an apple computer). I would guess we will see new MacBook Pros in late fall or MacWorld 2011 might be a good time to announce the new MacBook Pros too. (this assumes Apple releases computers only arranged around the Macworld shows which doesn&#8217;t seem to be the case lately. This used to be a big deal &#8211; the macworld trade shows, but with the internet growing and growing you don&#8217;t have to have a trade show much any more really. If Apple sneezes it&#8217;s online or tweeted or live blogged  in milliseconds anyway)

Back to my crystal ball gazing about when we&#8217;ll see new MacBook Pros that could take 16GB of memory and as I said earlier: late 2010 or early 2011. I have NO inside info, but this is just an educated guess.  It might be later if apple just does a simple speed bump to the MacBook Pros and uses the same 1066MHz memory.

The biggest problem with squeezing 16GB into a MBP is just that: room. Pretty much every Mac portable has offered 1 and lately two memory upgrade slots, for the simple reason that as small as they are: so-dimms are still pretty big and there&#8217;s also lots of other things in your apple notebook that needed to be squeezed into tight spaces too.

So that means that we could be waiting for a bit. Assuming only 2 memory upgrade slots, there would have to be not only the technology to recognize and accept 16GB on any new future MacBook Pros there would also need to be 8GB macbook memory modules which I have yet to come across.

If you&#8217;re looking for 16GB MacBook Pro RAM you might be waiting for a while until the technology catches up. It will, it&#8217;s just a matter of when you can [buy 16GB MacBook Pro RAM][6]

[8GB Memory MacBook Pro][1] prices are much more reasonable in price currently than they have been in the past.  In the past to upgrade your Apple MacBook Pro with 8gb of ram would have cost the same as a new macbook with memory prices for macbook pro being almost 1000 dollars you have to have deep, deep pockets to upgrade your macbook pro to 8GB total and unless you we doing high intensity work that required the most ram for whatever the cost such as photoshop or image editing or working with movies whether it be final cut or iMovie you might be inclined to stick with the stock ram in your mbp as upgrading  to 8GB MacBook Pro Memory sure was pricey.

That was then and this is now and for a few reasons, it makes a lot more sense to buy ram for your macbook pro. Especially now, with the back to school season and soon after the holiday shopping for 2010 season upon us sooner than we&#8217;d like it might make sense to upgrade with 8GB ram now.

[<img title="Cheap MacBook Pro RAM" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-3.48.40-PM.png" alt="Best MacBook Pro Memory" width="313" height="293" />][2]

**[Cheap 8GB MacBook Pro RAM][2]**

It&#8217;s always been my thought &#8211; and this applies to all memory upgrades whether it&#8217;s for apple notebooks or desktops is to max out the ram.  Adding the maximum ram  to your MacBook Pro means you only pay once for memory upgrades and then you&#8217;re done. My current computer is a macbook pro personally and I coughed up $100 (yes, I buy ram just like you) and maxed out my macbook pro and it just works. It will be close to two years with the same computer so my memory upgrade cost me about  $4 a month over the two years. That&#8217;s the same price as a fancy cup of coffee.  I have forgotten about my memory upgrade since as I bought my ram from a reputable memory vendor that sells quality ram built to apple specifications but without the extra price you can  sometimes pay when shopping for ram from Apple directly.

8GB of RAM is the [most ram you can currently install][3] into a MacBook Pro and I suggest you do just that. As I write this 8GB will set you back about  $250 or so from many vendors for the 8GB MacBook Pro memory kits. Not the cheapest ram you can buy, no. $250 would buy a lot of cool apple toys like an ipod, or iphone or some other apple software or accessor but it won&#8217;t let you get your work done faster. We&#8217;re going to assume you&#8217;re a pro as you bought  the pro macbook for the extra features so you could benefit from bigger display, more speed , etc and you paid a pretty penny to do so. It only makes sense to squeeze the most you can out of your MacBook Pro and  install the maximum ram you can too. I bet if you&#8217;re making a living or even freelancing part time you&#8217;ll make the money back that you spent to buy 8GB Memory MacBook Pro in no time.

When you consider adding ram to a computer there&#8217;s a lot more to ask yourself  rather than just what&#8217;s the best memory deal I can get?  In fact, I have found that the best ram prices have very little to do with what you need when you consider[ buying more memory][1] for your Apple or PC computer.

[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1360" title="Best Toshiba Laptop" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-4.28.41-PM.png" alt="Cheap Toshiba Notebook" width="643" height="429" />][2]

**[Cheap Toshiba Notebook Computers][3]**

It doesn&#8217;t matter whether you have the latest computer or even a brand new computer you should  always  buy new ram not used memory. Yes, you can save money when you buy ram but you have absoltutely no gaurantee on the memory preformance. It&#8217;s quite possible you could damage your computer with used ram and that&#8217;s why I always recommend you start your search for memory here. I have been listing and tracking the best prices on ram from the best memory stores for longer than I care to share. Ok , since you asked I  have thirteen years experience with ram and memory upgrades and I have saved thousands of people just like you money on new computer ram upgrades from manufacturers like Apple, Dell, HP and Compaq. I guess I should also list[ Sony RAM][4] and Toshiba memory too. You can get a great deal on ram when you shop for ram online.

I mean really, if the memory is designed to work and and is compatible with  both Macintosh and  Windows OS (or operating systems as they are sometimes called) does it matter where you bought the memory.

I can understand why you would  want to buy an apple computer as they offer good design and relatively and arguable affordability. The new Macs &#8211; and I mean all of them from [iMac][5] to [MacBook Pros ][6]to[ Mac Pros][7] they all offer value and that&#8217;s why they are the best selling computers today when you factor in ease of use and lack of viruses when all you want to do is surf the web and get some work done.

Maybe your&#8217;e here because you heard or read somewhere that the easiest computer upgrade you can do is to add ram or memory and  it&#8217;s true. RAM is so cheap these days.

I remember when I started to look  for the best deals on RAM and this is a time when even 1GB of RAM for a computer was astounding and a store online started to carry and sell 1GB RAM and I had to check with the store to be sure they hadn&#8217;t made a price mistake as the 1 GB of ram at the time was priced  at $2500. Wow, those were the days.

Fast forward to today where you  would  have a hard time even spending $2500 on an entire computer, let alone an upgrade for the computer. We&#8217;ve come a long way, baby &#8211; like the old cigarette ads used to say (I&#8217;m dating myself here)

But now it&#8217;s 2010 and all you wan to know is how much is memory? What does RAM cost ? Is there a gaurantee?  Does the RAM come with free shipping? How long has the memory store been in business. Is my credit card data with the memory store secure?

If you don&#8217;t ask all these questions when you are looking for the best price on ram and memory upgrades you should be. It&#8217;s your hard earned money you&#8217;re spending and lots of memory companies want to sell you ram so they can stay in business and profit.

You wan to save money on RAM which is why you searched for &#8220;what is the price to add ram to a computer&#8221; in  the first place. If you didn&#8217;t care you would just call dell or apple or  toshiba or wherever and pay full price or even more than full price for ram.

But if you do your homework you can not only save money on memory upgrades you can sleep better at night knowing you did the work and didn&#8217;t spend all your money on RAM when you have other expenses.

The good news is you are here and you want to know the price for computer upgrades and let me tell you, you&#8217;ve come to the right place. Where else can you buy ram from a selection of memory store that all offer the  best ram prices in some way. You&#8217;ll notice I didn&#8217;t say the lowest ram prices because you must consider other factors when buying ram such as frees shipping and customer service and all those other factors to consider when buying memory upgrades that I listed further up this article.

But if price is your main concern for modern computers in 2010 regardless of make or model they all pretty much can benefit for a DDR3 1066 or sometimes DDR3 1333 ram upgrade. Yes, there&#8217;s still a bit of demand for older memory chips as some schools and  cheap business (cheap people too) used older computers and are looking to squeeze every last drop of performance out of their computing dollar and a memory upgrade does just that. Dollar for dollar a ram upgrade is the best upgrade you can do for your desktop or notebook computer today.

Right, price.  ram prices change so much over time by the time I hit publish the ram prices will be old news and new ram modules will have become available. What usually happens is this: new ram is made. it&#8217;s pricey as it&#8217;s expensive. An example would be the 1GB ram when it first came on the market. You had to have very deep pockets to afford  1GB of ram a decade or so ago. We are seeing the same with newer ram modules too. 8GB for your iMac or MacBook Pro  if you&#8217;re an Apple fan is not cheap. Yet.

Notice that I said: Yet. The ram prices for expensive ram will drop and drop and drop until the demand  lowers and then the prices for ram for your older computer by this time will actually increase a bit as the demand has dropped so the prices have to rise.

But as I write this, I find that spending $100 or even less on memory upgrades will allow you get the maximum performance out of your computer and the price to add ram to you computer rarely exceeds the $100 price for most modern computers today.  There are a few exceptions to this rule as some of the professional computers need  more expensive memory. This makes sense in my thinking &#8211; if you are making a living with your computer you should expect to pay more for a memory upgrade than grandma who is just emailing the grand children on her netbook.

Regardless, RAM prices are cheap and I fully endorse that you should upgrade ram to the fullest and maximum you can afford for memory upgrades

I wish [Apple][1] would release their models yearly instead of the way they do because after a while when you go to look up your iMac model you almost need a PHD to figure out what model of iMac you have and if you&#8217;re upgrading what iMac RAM or Memory you need to buy.  They do much better with  their releases of their phones which seem  to come out yearly now and the naming is a little easier to understand the iPhone 3 was in &#8217;08 and then came the iPhone 3GS and lastly even with all it&#8217;s antenna problems has been named the iPhone 4.  Somewhere it makes sense to just upgrade the innards and keep it all the same as far as computer names but it sure was a lot easier when there was only one iMac, not many many different Apple iMac Models from which to choose.

Rant over,  Apple released new Apple iMac models earlier this week and I have already found some stores that carry [iMac RAM][2]. Its&#8217; still early days but the stores that are the price leaders usually don&#8217;t cater to Apple Memory per se,  but carry computer memory for all types of RAM and not just Apple.

[<img title="IMac Deals" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-4.34.06-PM.png" alt="Best iMac Price" width="544" height="412" />][3]

**[Cheapest Apple iMac][3]**

But those that are more in tune with the Apple market and Apple community tend  to get their Apple RAM listed first as they can do it  themselves and updated their pages to add apple iMac memory. Heck, one store even sent  me a press release saying  that they now carried the Apple iMac Memory for the new Apple iMac  2010. I&#8217;m going to call it that I think because this really is new and  released just in time for those wanting to buy a new Apple Computer for back to school or the Christmas holiday shopping season. Apple even has a deal now where if you buy a mac you get a free iPod too.

But, we&#8217;re here today to talk about RAM for the new iMacs.  As always I am  relectunt to tell you to buy from one specific memory store because it&#8217;s your money not  mine. But I can tell you that Crucial Technology, Other World Computing, Data Memory Systems and RAMJET all offer ram for the new iMacs in stock and ready to ship.

This ram is new to the Apple lineup and the first to include the DDR3 1333MHZ specification, so all or any memory you have from older Apple iMacs won&#8217;t work in the new Apple iMac models. You&#8217;ll have to buy new ram upgrades to upgrade the new Apple iMacs.

The other good news with  the release of  the summer 2010 iMacs  is they can accept more ram  &#8211; up to 16gb if your budget allows for it as there&#8217;s four memory slots on each of the new Apple iMacs and each slot can take 4GB of RAM.  So you could have 4GB, 8GB or 16GB memory upgrade configurations on the new iMacs.

Where do you buy the best 4GB RAM for MacBook?

**[Cheap MacBook RAM][1]**

That&#8217;s a very good question but it comes down to what you think best means. You might be looking for the lowest price on 4GB for MacBook or you might want to buy ram for macbook that can get to you the fastest as possible with overnight delivery and free shipping too if you can swing it. I have found to get free shipping on ram you have to spend $100 as a minimum  and unless you buy two 4GB ram for macbook or more you may not qualify for frees shipping when buying ram.

But then there&#8217;s another question:  what macbook? And you  can&#8217;t specify just &#8216;white macbook&#8217; or even &#8216;black macbook&#8217; as even with those two choices, it does specify things a bit and your macbook ram choices are narrowed down but that&#8217;s still not enough really. One way to figure out what type of ram you need is to go to the top left corner of your macbook pro and select &#8216;about this mac&#8217; where you&#8217;ll see that the info provided will provide you with the speed of your computer  memory which might be helpful.

For a long time the macbooks  couldn&#8217;t take  or accept 4GB  RAM as they maxed out at 2gb of RAM with 2x1GB PC5300 DDR so-dimms for macbook being the only and biggest ram memory upgrades you could get. Then over the years memory for MacBooks got cheaper and it was found that some of the macbooks would acceptt 3GB of Macbook RAM with  a 1GB ram chip in one slot  and  a 2GB memory chip in the other.

And for a while that was the biggest macbook memory you could get.  But time marches on and  Apple released newer macbooks that shipped standard from the factory with [2GB of MacBook ][2]RAM but you could pull the 2x1gB macbook memory and make keychains out of it or sell the ram on craigslist to offset the costs you could then take your  new found wealth and buy 2x2GB of RAM which  made your macbook run faster and would help you get to the the best [4GB of RAM for MacBook. ][3]

Fast forward to today, and there&#8217;s been a few speed bumps and some cosmetic changes to the Apple MacBook but for the most part it still looks and feels the same as the older macbook computers but these new macbooks  due to the faster processors  all used DDR3 1066 memory and the latest and greatest macbooks  still only accept 4GB of ram at most  and like all the others will require you to remove or replace the 2x1GB RAM chips and replace them with 2x 2GB Macbook RAM which will give you 4GB of RAM.

So now you know the history of the MacBook and how over time you could double the macbook ram from 2gb to 4gb you still cannot put 8GB  of RAM  into a MacBook and for that you&#8217;ll need to buy a MacBook  Pro which is much more expensive than a MacBook but offers a few advantages too  &#8211; one being the 8GB memory maximum for MacBook Pro .

The**[ best 4GB RAM for MacBook][4]** is when you buy ram from reputable memory stores that offer great prices and also a great prices on ram for MacBooks too.  Just remember to shop for RAM for MacBooks from a store that you can trust.
