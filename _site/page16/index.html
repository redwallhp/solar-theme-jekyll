    <h1><a href="/2015/10/will-apples-control-freakery-turn-personal-computers-into-big-iphones/">Will Apple’s Control-Freakery Turn Personal Computers Into Big iPhones?</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>Dan Gillmor, <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2015/09/23/will_apple_s_control_freakery_turn_personal_computers_into_big_iphones.html">writing for Slate</a> asks this question as he ponders the future of Apple’s Devices:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’d just purchased was probably my last Mac. Apple, I said, was becoming more and more control-freakish in how it allowed customers to use the hardware they’d purchased. It seemed clear that the company intended to move its personal computers “into a more iPad/iPhone-like ecosystem, where Apple gives you permission to use the computers you buy in only the ways Apple considers appropriate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With the release of Apple’s new iPad Pro he might be on to something. I know the Mac isn’t going anywhere tomorrow, but some have already switched to <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-8-changed-how-i-work-on-my-iphone-and-ipad/">using their iPads as their primary devices</a> so Dan might be on to something.</p>

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>This is <a href="http://austinmann.com/trek/iphone-6s-camera-review-switzerland">worth a look</a> if you’re at all interested in how the iPhone 6s cameras compare vs the iPhone 6 cameras. Are their really improvements?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We’ve shot a lot on the 6s. In fact, we’ve already shot 2121 photos + 55 panoramas + 237 time-lapses + 1310 videos (including Live Photos)!</p>

  <p>All along the way we’ve been carefully comparing the results to the iPhone 6.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2015/10/ars-technica-reviews-android-marshmallow-6-0/">Ars Technica Reviews Android Marshmallow 6.0</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>Ars Technica has <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/10/android-6-0-marshmallow-thoroughly-reviewed/">one of the most thorough reviews</a> on Android’s operating system spanning over 12 pages:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Marshmallow makes many long-requested features a reality with selectable app permissions, a data backup system that actually works, and the ability to format SD cards as Ext4, allowing the system to treat cards just like internal storage. Marshmallow is also prepared for the future with support for USB Type-C’s power delivery spec, a Fingerprint authentication API, and 4K display support. And, as with any Android release, there’s also lots of new Googley stuff—a slick new search interface and a contextual search mode called “Google Now on Tap,” for example.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As a current Android user I’m interested to see what Marshmallow looks like in real life, but in the meantime this article is a great way to explore Google’s new software</p>

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>Ben Brooks at <a href="http://www.brooksreview.net">Brooks Review</a> has researched most, if not all of the content blockers available for iOS and has come up with a <a href="https://brooksreview.net/2015/09/content-blocker-test/">four part review of all the most popular content blockers</a> available and what are the fastest:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Which content blocker for iOS 9 is the best? I have no clue, but I did test a bunch to find out which one is the fastest.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you want to speed up your browsing experience and stop getting tracked by websites then you need a good content blocker and Ben’s results can help you find the right one.</p>

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>The Sweet Setup reviews the<a href="http://thesweetsetup.com/apps/the-best-wikipedia-app-for-iphone/"> best wikipedia app for the iPhone</a> from a list of  4 other contenders:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Wikipedia is thoroughly useable in a mobile browser. It’s quite easy to search, browse, and read this massive repository of information with mobile Safari or what-have-you. The use case for a dedicated app is in the fact that Wikipedia isn’t meant for casual reading. It’s a reference tool. To get the most out of it, you must look beyond a web browser.</p>

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>Everymac.com has compiled a great article on the <a href="http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/iphone/iphone-faq/differences-between-iphone-6s-iphone-6s-plus-models.html">differences between the two latest Apple iPhones for 2015:</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It would be easy to take a look at the larger iPhone 6s Plus and smaller iPhone 6s side-by-side and conclude that size is the differentiating factor. Although there is some truth to this general observation, there are other important differences that are not so obvious.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you’re looking to compare the two models this site looks at the differences between camera, battery life, screens and even identification differences so you can tell the 2 apart this is the resource you need.</p>

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>Dan Moren at Six Colors <a href="http://sixcolors.com/post/2015/10/the-chromecast-audio-compact-but-not-compelling/">reviews the new Google Chromecast Audio</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Chromecast Audio is an interesting product, but after I spent about an hour or so playing around with it, I realized that I don’t really have much of a need for it. But that doesn’t mean it’s a bad product, necessarily, just that my setup doesn’t really lend itself to this device.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have been interested in this device to replace my bluetooth wireles transmitter device and this is one of the first reviews I have seen.</p>

		<div class="post-content"><p>Dan Knight at Low End Mac has <a href="http://lowendmac.com/2015/the-rise-and-fall-of-mac-os-x-versions-2009-to-2015/">quite the interesting chart</a> with six years of data of the Mac OS versions that are used when visiting his site from 2009 to 2015:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Over time, the distribution of Mac OS versions among Mac users changes as new versions of the OS are released, old Macs are retired, and new models arrive that only support the most recent version. Today we’re looking at six years worth of data.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I bet this took a fair bit of time to gather all the data and chart it all out.</p>
