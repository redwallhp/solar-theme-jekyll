<br>

		<div class="post-content">I had a hunch I was right yesterday when I researched the new iMacs from Apple for late 2015 &#8211; and I wanted to be sure before I posted otherwise, but the way I read the specs on Apple&#8217;s [technical specs page for the iMacs][1] was that **only the 27 inch iMac** was upgradable and site sponsor OWC confirms this with a [teardown of the Apple&#8217;s 21 inch model][2].

> Memory is soldered in. OWC recommends buying as much memory as you can at the time of purchase to increase the longevity and usefulness of your iMac. 

This means that like OWC suggests that if you&#8217;re going to want to max out the ram on the 21.5 inch iMacs to full capacity you have to do so at time of purchase.

Also, check out the gallery at the link above as they have some **great tear down and unboxing photos** of the 21.5 inch retina iMac (Late 2015)

<br>

		<div class="post-content">Data Memory Systems also now carries ram for Apple&#8217;s new iMacs. The selection isn&#8217;t as big as some other vendors but with the [8GB RAM Upgrade from DMS][1] for the Apple 27 inch Late 2015 models you will be able to max out the iMac to 32GB for under $200.00, which is about half the price if you bought the ram from Apple directly.

<br>

		<div class="post-content">Now that the ram prices are starting to come online for the new 27 inch Apple iMacs (Late 2015), [I&#8217;ve started to track the prices,][1] and unless you&#8217;re willing to cough up over $1000 for the 64GB upgrade option (double the recommended by Apple) most other sizes are perfectly affordable.

Perhaps not as cheap as the DDR3 1600MHz ram prices you see above but considering this is newer and faster ram for the faster iMacs with retina displays you can still max out these iMac models with 32GB of RAM for under $300.00

So far, I&#8217;ve found some pricing from [Data Memory Systems][2] and [OWC][3] and Amazon but more vendors will show up next week or so and I will continue to built out the price list as the ram upgrades become available.

Also, remember you can only upgrade the ram on the Late 2015 27 inch iMacs . If you&#8217;re looking for ram upgrades for the 21.5 inch retina display iMac, [you&#8217;re out of luck][4].

<br>

		<div class="post-content">Apple&#8217;s released new iMac Models today in both 21.5 inch and 27 inch displays. Their tech specs state that these new iMacs take faster 1867MHz ram vs the slower 1600MHz ram that&#8217;s been in close to every mac for the past few years.

I have yet to find a memory vendor that **actually sells** 1867MHz ram for the new iMacs (except for [Amazon][1]) but as in the past when the new Apple computers ship the memory vendors eventually carry the new ram upgrades for the new models and I will update ramseeker when the time comes.

Of course, if you really need a Maxed out late 2015 iMac today then the only other option will be to buy it direct from Apple, but the memory direct from Apple isn&#8217;t all that cheap:

The cost to upgrade from the stock 8GB to 16GB is a $200 price bump, and if you want to max out your brand new iMac it will cost you $400 for 32GB of RAM from Apple compared to what looks to be about $100/16GB if the pricing I found at Amazon are any indication.

For more info on the new Apple iMacs:

[Apple][2], of course but also [Jason Snell has a review][3] of the new iMacs over at Macworld.

I will keep you updated when the other vendors come on board with more ram upgrade options for the new late 2015 iMac models with retina displays.

update: a few vendors have memory upgrades now in stock and I have started to track pricing [here][4]

<br>

		<div class="post-content">Dan Gillmor, [writing for Slate][1] asks this question as he ponders the future of Apple&#8217;s Devices:

> I&#8217;d just purchased was probably my last Mac. Apple, I said, was becoming more and more control-freakish in how it allowed customers to use the hardware they&#8217;d purchased. It seemed clear that the company intended to move its personal computers “into a more iPad/iPhone-like ecosystem, where Apple gives you permission to use the computers you buy in only the ways Apple considers appropriate. 

With the release of Apple&#8217;s new iPad Pro he might be on to something. I know the Mac isn&#8217;t going anywhere tomorrow, but some have already switched to [using their iPads as their primary devices][2] so Dan might be on to something.

<br>

		<div class="post-content">Ars Technica has [one of the most thorough reviews][1] on Android&#8217;s operating system spanning over 12 pages:

> Marshmallow makes many long-requested features a reality with selectable app permissions, a data backup system that actually works, and the ability to format SD cards as Ext4, allowing the system to treat cards just like internal storage. Marshmallow is also prepared for the future with support for USB Type-C&#8217;s power delivery spec, a Fingerprint authentication API, and 4K display support. And, as with any Android release, there&#8217;s also lots of new Googley stuff—a slick new search interface and a contextual search mode called &#8220;Google Now on Tap,&#8221; for example. 

As a current Android user I&#8217;m interested to see what Marshmallow looks like in real life, but in the meantime this article is a great way to explore Google&#8217;s new software

> Wikipedia is thoroughly useable in a mobile browser. It’s quite easy to search, browse, and read this massive repository of information with mobile Safari or what-have-you. The use case for a dedicated app is in the fact that Wikipedia isn’t meant for casual reading. It’s a reference tool. To get the most out of it, you must look beyond a web browser.
