<blockquote>
  <p>DMS has been supplying the electronics industry with high quality components since 1963 and memory modules since 1987. We are one of the first original Memory Companies to support Apple Computer and have been doing so for over 20 years. We also support a vast array of Computer Memory for PC’s and Servers. Data Memory Systems is a New Hampshire based Corporation located in Tax Free Salem NH. Our philosophy is to supply the customer with the best quality memory at the best possible price. We pride ourselves on exceptional service with the most knowledgeable and courteous sales staff in the business, with many years of experience. At DMS there is no voice message prompts, WE ANSWER THE PHONES! We welcome call-in orders or questions or you can just order on-line (SAME LOW PRICE!). Here at DMS we run our own in-house test lab. We can assure you that your memory will be DMS Certified tested Memory. All our Memory is tested in the most current state-of-the-art systems. This is done to put your mind at ease for years of trouble-free operation. In the unlikely event you do receive a defective Memory module, DMS will replace it free of charge, before we even receive the defective memory back. DMS covers the cost of shipping to you as well as the return freight charges. DMS is the first Company to offer this service, with great customer satisfaction for over 20 years. Not all memory is the same. The lowest price is not always the best option. Once you’ve purchased DMS Certified Memory you will insist on it again for all your computer needs. We back that up with our LIFETIME GUARANTEE.</p>
