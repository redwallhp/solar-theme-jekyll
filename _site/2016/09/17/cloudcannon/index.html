<p>this looks <strong>really</strong> neat: a <a href="http://cloudcannon.com">CMS for Jekyll.</a> If you want a free site to host your pages, create one on <a href="pages.githbub.com">github pages</a> and then when you hit published the content gets build and pushed to your github pages site easily</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The best of both worlds
<br />Developers and non-developers easily collaborate on sites without stepping on each other’s toes.</p>

  <p>Developers have complete control over the source code and simply build static or Jekyll websites.</p>

  <p>Non-developers update content visually using the CloudCannon inline editor.</p>
