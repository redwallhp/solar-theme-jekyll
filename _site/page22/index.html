   <B> <h1><a href="/2012/11/when-will-the-2013-macbook-air-release-date-be/">When Will The 2013 MacBook Air Release Date Be?</a></h1></B>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content">## When will the new 2013 MacBook Air Be Released?

It&#8217;s now pushing December 2012 as I write this and the MacBook Air line from Apple is [**now the oldest Mac you can buy today**][1]. iMacs, Mac Mini&#8217;s and MacBook Pros have all seen refreshes and are new. In fact, the <del><strong>2012 iMacs aren&#8217;t even shipping yet</strong></del> (update, they are here) and the 2013 MacBook Air should be the next Apple computer to be released. I hope.

Ultrabooks are here to stay, make no mistake and now that [**PC notebooks are under $400**][2] and[** ultrabooks under $500**][3] one has to ask themselves if it&#8217;s even worth it to buy a MacBook Air in 2013. IF you want to buy the cheapest ultrabook you can you can now **pick up a chromebook for under $250**. Granted there&#8217;s lots you can&#8217;t do with a chromebook thanks to it&#8217;s OS that&#8217;s really not much more than a chrome web browser. If you need to do some serious video editing or photo editing a chromebook isn&#8217;t for you, but you must admit it&#8217;s an attractive alternativ to a MacBook Air. You could buy five chromebooks for the same price as one MacBook Air. I know that with my work it&#8217;s all web based for the most part and I think I could  make do with one. (I should buy a chromebook and test it and report back).

## Is There a New MacBook Air Soon?

I have no inside information on the workings of Apple and their future products but I see a release date of early 2013  &#8211; maybe as early as mid January. This may be a little early as the lastest MacBook Air models were released in June 2012 so that&#8217;s just seven months from the last release if I&#8217;m right. Apple may take a bit longer to finally release a new MacBook Air but early winter to early spring is a good guess, and that&#8217;s all it is: a guess.

## Will There Be a $500 MacBook Air?

I don&#8217;t  think so. Apple has priced their products as high end consumer electronics rather than selling commodities like PC&#8217;s that are just the sum of their parts with Windows OS tacked on.  These windows ultrabooks  are priced at $500.00 now. Apple products have always been extraordinarily higher. Take tablets as an example: An iPad Mini  costs over $300 while android based tablets like the Nexus 7 from google or the Kindle from Amazon are priced under $200.00. I think if there&#8217;s any discount on future MacBook Air&#8217;s it will be small. There could be a small price decrease &#8211; maybe a bump both MacBook Airs down in price by $200, but again &#8211; why would Apple do this? These small and light Apple notebooks are selling in the thousand dollar price range quite nicely and have for some time. I doubt Apple would do this.

## **What New Features Will the New MacBook Air Have?**

A faster processor is a given. If nothing else, you&#8217;ll get a speed bump. I also wonder if Apple will include a lightning connector on future Apple product? I have no idea how this would be used but it&#8217;s a thought. A retinal display is probably a given, but one argument against this would be that the MacBook Air would cannibalize sales of MacBook Pros that already have retina displays.  I don&#8217;t think that Apple will really change the MacBook Air that much. There&#8217;s only so small they can make the thing and I think they are real close to being there. More RAM and bigger SSD drives are another really good possibility as both ram and SSD prices continue to drop. This might be a good way for Apple to justify the higher pricing. More RAM and more storage is always welcome

## Would I Buy a MacBook Air in 2013?

I&#8217;ve lived without a MacBook Air for over five years now, and I&#8217;ll probably continue along this path. I have a relatively fast windows notebook  with Windows 8 with a lot more weight than the MacBook Air, but a much bigger screen and much cheaper. I could buy three of these notebooks for the price of one 13 inch MacBook Air. If I need to buy any notebook, I think a Google Chromebook is probably on my shopping list for any new ultrabook computer. I live in chrome and a text editor and as I type this I am listening to Pandora so I don&#8217;t even need  to store any music. I think that in 2007 a MacBook Air was a much more attractive choice for a small and light notebook, but now with release of netbooks and chromebooks and ultrabooks with Windows 8 there are much cheaper  choices for small and light computers in 2013.

   <B> <h1><a href="/2012/11/who-has-the-best-memory-scanner/">Who Has the Best Memory Scanner?</a></h1></B>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content">There&#8217;s lots of ways to find out what memory you need to buy but the best way to get the right ram for your Mac or PC (or even unix box) is to **use a memory scanner. **Depending on what store you buy memory from, you could be using a memory tool,memory finder, or memory software or memory configurator.

Some memory stores list a million products on their front page with best selling memory lists, best memory upgrade brands, and so on but almost every store offers a memory scanner to help you buy the correct memory. Most memory scanners work the same: You pick the brand, computer type and model and a program spits back of compatible memory upgrades. The scanner also offers a buch of other useful information too like the maximum memory allowed, memory banks available, memory type required and more. But, like all things in life some memory scanners are better than others  so let&#8217;s  have a look:

[**Amazon**][1]. Amazon may have the cheapest prices on RAM but you need to know what memory type you need. Sometimes for the Mac Memory you can search for MacBook Pro memory for an example  and you will get some results returned, but to view the entire selection you really should know what ram you need to buy before you visit Amazon. One way to find out the right ram is to read reviews on memory upgrades and check the best selling memory upgrade lists too. If everybody else is buying a particular type of RAM, you can probably do some research and see if the ram that&#8217;s selling will work in your Mac or PC.

**[RAMJET][2] **Ramjet has had the exact same website since the mid-nineties and at one time did not have any memory selector tool at all &#8211; just links to pages but in recent years they do offer a pull down menu like the others that allow you to choose ram for popular  Macintosh computers. RAMJET does sell PC memory too but their primary focus and sales are for Macintosh memory upgrades. One area for improvement might be in the sorting &#8211; they list ram for the oldest models on the top of the page and you have to scroll for newer modeles. I would reverse this.

[**Crucial Technology**][3]

Crucial has in some ways almost too much choice when scanning for the right RAM. You can start with their memory configurator, use the memory scanner that scans your PC and reports on ram compatibility. Lastly, you can search for model names and I have goodl luck with that as the search engine usually offers the information I need. When Crucial finds the right ram for your PC you get info on maximum memory, memory type and memory slots available

[**Data Memory Systems **][4]DMS just updated their website and now offers many more memory upgrades than before but you have to work a bit hardter to find them as you have to select type of memory (desktop, notebook etc), memory brand, memory line and  memory model. That&#8217;s a lot. But, the good news is once you find the page with your memory upgrade on it , there&#8217;s a lot of information including what the original memory is/was  in your specific computer model in addition to the maximum memory, number of memory slots available and memory type.

**[OEMPCWORLD][5] **is the only other computer memory store besides Crucial Technology that offers both a memory scanner and memory configurator. The configurator works just like all the others and matches your  PC to the memory type but the scanner actually scans your PC for the memory you need. It&#8217;s noted that this is a one-time scan that happens and the software doesn&#8217;t scan the contents of your hard drive &#8211; it&#8217;s more interested in your hardware than software. If you prefer to not use this for security or paranoia or both, then you can still use the memory configurator that this store offers.

**Who has the best memory scanner?** If you want to have software actually scan your computer you have to choose between Crucial and OEMPCWORLD and I give the nod to Crucial due to the brand name. If you don&#8217;t want to use a system scanner to find the right memory upgrade than you&#8217;re using a memory configurator and most offer the basics such as maximum memory, memory type and  number of memory upgrade slots. A few will just match you  up with memory type and leave you on your  own to figure out the maximum ram your PC would run. I would avoid these and the memory stores I list above do a much better job of helping you buy memory for your notebook or desktop PC.

   <B> <h1><a href="/2012/11/who-are-the-best-memory-suppliers/">Who Are The Best Memory Suppliers?</a></h1></B>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content">When buying memory online there&#8217;s a few things to consider before you place your online memory order and they are:

  * **RAM Type **Laptop or Desktop memory?
  * **Budget **How much can you afford?
  * **Brand Name or Generic **Do you need affordable memory or can you pay a little more for brand name?
  * **Store Reputation **There&#8217;s more than one memory store I would not recommend at all.
  * **Shipping Cost **Some offer free shipping and others don&#8217;t.
  * **Shipping Speed **How fast do you need your memory
  * **Stock.** Does the memory store stock the ram you need
  * **Easy to Find.** Some online memory stores make it impossible to find anything
  * **Reviews **What do others think about the store ([reseller ratings is a great resource][1])
  * **Warranty** What if something goes wrong with your memory

   <B> <h1><a href="/2012/11/first-look-crucial-upgrade-advisor/">First Look: Crucial Upgrade Advisor</a></h1></B>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content">Most other memory store where you can buy online call the tools they offer to help you configure your PC with more memory memory finders, memory tools or even memory configurators, but only [**Crucial calls theirs an &#8216;upgrade advisor&#8217;.**][1] I guess it is but you&#8217;re not asking the website what ram you use and it spits back an answer. Nope, you have to tell it all the specifics of your PC and then wait for it to match the specs with the RAM.

Also, if you forgo the memory advisor from Crucial you can find your ram numerous ways and one way is to visit Crucial and then select memory>shop by manufacturer and select your manufacturer you will see that the best upgrades for Apple are for much older computers. I mean really? when was the last time you thought about upgrading your PowerBook G4? The ram would cost as much as you can buy the notebook on eBay. This is a missed opportunity if you ask me. I think it would do Crucial much better to promote more modern Apple memory like the new 2012 MacBook Pro&#8217;s or iMacs &#8211; memory that people are wanting to buy.

Quibbles aside: If you use the Crucial Upgrade Advisor you get one thing that might just trump all &#8211; and that&#8217;s a guarantee that the RAM you will buy will work &#8211; or you get to send it back for a refund (or an exchange). This is actually a great marketing scheme if you think about it: You do all the work by entering all your data (which you have to do anyway to figure out your memory) and then Crucial&#8217;s advisor spits out the RAM (and BTW tends to list the largest ram first &#8211; at least they got that right) and guarantees it will work.

Other stores guarantee their RAM but save for a badge or something on the bottom of their sites&#8217; homepage their warranty isn&#8217;t something that&#8217;s promoted much, and in this area alone Crucial&#8217;s got them beat. They promote the warranty that comes with the advisor which I am sure sells more memory and yet lowers support costs. First, you enter the data so as long as you enter the right info there&#8217;s no way the advisor can mess up. A lot of computers use the exact same part so they&#8217;re just selling you the same ram regardless of PC model. And because you used the advisor from Crucial instead of just guessing there&#8217;s less chance of returns. In effect their guarantee costs very little to offer because they know the ram will work and it&#8217;s tested name brand memory. There will be very few problems when handled correctly and Crucial knows this.

The Crucial Upgrade Advisor is a good deal for both customers and Crucial alike. It keeps support costs low and the you know you will get the right ram for your Mac or PC, [**guaranteed**][1].

    Corsair RAM is a really good value
  </p>
</div>

&nbsp;

Corsair RAM has been around for at least as long as I have been tracking memory prices, if not longer and you can buy Corsair RAM directly at [Corsair.com ][1] or from third party websites and memory resllers such as Amazon and others.

## Corsair Memory Products

Corsair ram comes in a variety of different memory types, sizes and speeds as well as selling hard drives and other PC related products such as PC cases, cooling supplies and USB flash drives, but I want to first look at the different Corsair Memory Types. Corsair memory is offered in five main computer memory types:

  1. Intel Memory Upgrades
  2. AMD Memory Upgrades
  3. Mac Memory Upgrades
  4. Notebook Memory Upgrades

These main memory types from Corsair  are also available for sale for any budget from budget memory upgrades to the most advanced memory technology available today. The Corsair memory upgrade categories are:

  1. Dominator Platinum
  2. Dominator
  3. Vengeance
  4. XMS
  5. Value Select

## Where to Buy Corsair Memory Upgrades

Corsair memory is offered directly from the company (a bit pricey, if you ask me) and like pretty much all memory stores offers an easy to use shopping cart as well as a memory configurator to help you order the correct RAM for your notebook or PC. Corsair calls their configurator the Corsair Memory Finder. But if you want the best deal on Corsair memory I suggest you check Amazon for cheaper prices on Corsair ram than you could buy from the factory direct. There have even been times where there has been a rebate coupon for Corsair memory that increases the savings even more. Below are som of the best selling Corsair Memory Upgrades on sale today:

   <B> <h1><a href="/2012/11/what-is-triple-channel-memory/">What is Triple Channel Memory?</a></h1></B>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content">Triple Channel Memory is ram that offers (big surprise) more bandwidth than dual channel or even single channel memory. Single Channel memory runs at 64 bits, Dual Channel memory is 128 bits and lastly triple channel memory runs at 192bits.

DDR3 memory is the common name for triple channel memory upgrades and can be in the form of both DDR SDRAM dimms for destkop computer use or in sodimm memory modules for use with notebook computers. Common speeds of triple channel memory can be DDR3 1600MHz or DDR3 1333Mhz with the prior being the most popular triple channel memory type for computers in 2012 and beyond.

## Triple Channel Memory Use

It&#8217;s recommended to install triple channel memory in matched pairs. Most computers offer either two, four or in some cases eight memory upgrade slots with various memory upgrade banks  and it&#8217;s best to fill each bank with the same memory type and speed. It&#8217;s not  suggested to mix triple memory speeds as this can hinder PC performance and in some cases damage the motherboard.

## How to Buy Triple Channel Memory

One way to get the correct ram for your desktop or PC is to use a memory upgrade configurator that will help you in getting the right RAM for your PC. All you do is enter your PC manufacturer, model name, and in some cases model Number. For example, manufacturer name would be Dell, model name would be Inspiron and model number would be N5010. When you have this information all you have to do is select the correct information and the memory upgrade store will help you get the right ram for your desktop or notebook PC.

Some computer  memory manufacturers also create a memory upgrade software that scans your  computer system to find the right memory type and then suggests compatible memory upgrades. [Crucial Technology][1] is one memory manufacturer that offers this.

If  you&#8217;re a more experienced computer user who is comfortable building your own PC you can forgo the memory configurator and software altogether and buy triple channel memory from a selection of memory stores, or  if you prefer you can order triple channel memory from Amazon. I find that in most cases Amazon has the cheapest memory upgrades. Below are some of the best selling triple channel memory upgrades on sale today:

   <B> <h1><a href="/2012/11/how-to-get-a-free-pc-memory-test/">How To Get a Free PC Memory Test</a></h1></B>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content">PC Memory, in rare instances can go bad. RAM Memory is a very sensitive computer component that is susceptible to static electicity that can fry your memory very quickly, so it&#8217;s always a good idea to use an anti-static wristband and install ram in a humid environment to reduce the chance of static electricity. But even if you install the memory correctly you can still have problems with your PC memory but thankfully there are many methods to test your PC memory for any errors.

## Remove the Memory

This seems kindof obvious I know, but one way to test ram to see if it&#8217;s bad is to remove and replace the memory upgrade with another memory chip. Usually, you have upgraded the ram in your PC with newer and larger memory upgrade modules, and if you still have the original factory installed memory upgrades all you have to do is replace the ram you suspect has gone bad with the older RAM. If your PC now runs without incident, then you know the RAM is bad and will have to be replaced. In the event of problems with your PC you should check your RAM for any problems

## Free PC Memory Testing Software

You don&#8217;t have to remove the ram you think has gone bad. There are many software programs that will allow you to test the memory in your PC without having to replace it to diagnose the memory problems:

[**Memtest86**][1]

This software is free software that allows you to test your PC ram for any errors. It&#8217;s easy to use and is a free download. This memory testing software does not require any software installed on the PC to run. Just download the ISO and using your  CD burning software. Easy to use, and diagnose any memory problems with this free memory testing software

[**Windows Memory Diagnostic**][2]

This memory testing software is like Memtest86 above, as it does not require an operating system to run and will run on any PC. Just download the ISO and follow the instructions to burn a bootable CD to test your PC memory with the Windows Memory Diagnostic Tool

[**MemTest86+**][3]

Note the plus sign at the end. This is newer memory testing software that tests for memory module failure. Download the ISO, burn to a CD and you can test the memory on your PC with ease with MemTest86+

These are just three of the memory testing software for your PC. One other way to be certain your PC memory is error free is to buy brand name memory or ram from a trusted memory manufacturer like Crucial, Corsair, or Kingston Memory. All these manufacturers offer a lifetime replacement guarantee in the event that your memory upgrade goes bad. Below are some of the more popular memory upgrades available on sale today:

<br>

		<div class="post-content">Micron Technology has been manufacturing ram and more recently flash memory products since the early 1980&#8217;s and at one point actually sold micron branded memory upgrades. But in 2012, Micron Technology sells most of the memory and flash memory they manufacture under two brand names:

## **[Crucial Technology][1]**

****  
Crucial Technology is one of the best memory upgrade brands you can buy and have been selling memory upgrades online for over 15 years now (at least as long as I have been tracking and monitoring ram prices.

One of the main features of Crucial Technology is the number of tools they offer to help you get the right memory upgrade for your computer regardless of make or computer brand.

   <B> <h1><a href="/2012/11/what-is-dual-channel-memory/">What is Dual Channel Memory?</a></h1></B>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content">Dual Channel Memory is commonly known as DDR or DDR2 memory and usually ships in two distinct sizes: SDRAM DDR2 DIMMS for desktop computers and DDR2 SDRAM sodimms for notebook computers. Speeds for DDR2 memory range from PC-3200 to PC-6400. In 2012, DDR2 dual channel memory is not the fastest DDR memory you can buy with DDR3 technology up tp 1600Mhz and beyond being the most popular DDR memory upgrades today. DDR2 memory upgrades were more popular from the period of about 2005 to 2008 when they were replaced with the much faster DDR3 memory standard.

## **How Dual Channel Memory Works**

Dual Channel Memory is usually installed in pairs, and refers to the fact that the DDR or DDR2 memory is used on the moterboard. With two memory slots on a DDR2 motherboard available for memory upgrades, when DDR2 or even DDR memory is installed the computer can process memory data twice as fast as the DDR standard. The dual channel allow for one memory bank to read and write data while the next memory bank is getting ready for the next stream of data. This eliminates wait time as one memory bank is always ready for the next stream of data, effectively doubling the read and write timings. To gain the advantage that DDR2 memory upgrades offer, it is recommended that you install DDR2 memory upgrades in matched pairs for the most reliable computing experience.

## Most Popular DDR2 Memory Brands

DDR2 dual channel memory is available in both generic memory where the memory vendor manufactures or resells the memory and the warranty for DDR2 generic memory depends on the vendor or  you can buy name brand DDR2 memory upgrades from a wide array of computer memory manufacturers: Crucial Technology, Kingston Technology and Corsair Memory are just a few DDR2 memory upgrade manufacturers that offer brand name memory and warranty support for dual channel memory upgrades.

## Where To  Buy Dual Channel Memory

You can buy dual channel memory from a wide array of memory vendors (see my list of memory stores bel0w) but some of the best prices and  cheapest dual channel memory upgrades tend to be found online at Amazon. Below are a few examples:

   <B> <h1><a href="/2012/11/how-to-upgrade-flash-memory/">How To Upgrade Flash Memory</a></h1></B>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content">Flash Memory is becoming the defacto memory standard of 2012 and int0 2013 with products from digital cameras to notebook computers and even smartphones using flash memory upgrades for more storage for your data. Flash memory comes in many different form factors depending on the device you want to use flash memory for but  below are some of the more common flash memory upgrades on sale today:

## Solid State Drives

Solid state hard drives have become the standard hard drive installed in many new notebook  computers (and to a lesser extent, desktop computers too) thanks to advancements in manufacturing and more demand for the much faster flash storage that SSD drives offer. At time of writing, one can buy a 128GB SSD drive for less than $100 and 256GB SSD drives  can be had for under $200.00. What was once a luxury on the leading edge is becoming more mainstream each and every day. SSD drives offer no moving parts, much faster read and write times and startup times than even the fastest standard drive. The disadvantage to the SSD drive is that larger capacity SSD&#8217;s at 512GB and up are still much more expensive than traditional hard drives in the same capacity

## Compact Flash Memory

Compact Flash Memory is usually used in more advanced digital cameras such as pro-sumer or  professional DSLR&#8217;s and offer faster read and write times than SDHC memory cards can offer that are smaller in size and more popular in compact digital cameras and other devices. Compact Flash memory upgrades are available in a wide array of sizes in speeds but common and best selling compact flash memory upgrades are 32GB  and up to 400x in speed.

## SDHC Memory

SDHC memory is available in many sizes. The standard micro SDHC memory cards are a favorite for digital camera and computer users thanks to their smaller size when compared to compact flash memory upgrades.  Micro SD memory cards are also a very popular choice for cellular and smartphones and it&#8217;s hard to imagine that storage space of up to 64GB can fit on a memory card smaller than your fingernail.

## USB Flash Memory

These might be the most popular types of flash memory and grace many a keychain or computer users desktop. With many shapes and sizes these USB drives or thumb drives come in a variety of  shapes and sizes from standard design to novelty designs shaped like teddy bears. USB flash memory is a popular marketing tool thanks to the fact that you can buy USB flash drives with your  company message screen printed on the flash drive itself. With a cost of under $1.00 each in  some cases, customized usb flash memory drives are a great way to promote your  company and your message or logo.

## Where To Buy Flash Memory Upgrades

All of these types of flash memory upgrades are available at numerous stores online but I find one of the best places to buy flash memory of any kind is at Amazon. They constantly have the [**lowest prices on flash memory**][1] regardless of type or size.
