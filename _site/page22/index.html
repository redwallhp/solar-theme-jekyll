    <h1><a href="/2012/11/what-ram-do-i-need-for-apple-imac/">What RAM Do I Need for Apple iMac?</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>One of the best ways to find out exactly what ram you need for your iMac is to use a memory configurator to get the best ram prices for iMac that you know will work. You also don’t have to guess with charts and tables either. All you have to do is choose your brand (Apple, obviously) what Apple iMac you have (2010, 2012, processor speed, screen size ) and the memory configurator will then tell you exactly what RAM you need to buy for your Apple iMac.</p>

<p><strong>2012 Apple iMac RAM Types </strong></p>

<p>The 2012 iMacs were just released in late October 2012 and now join the MacBook Pro models and the Mac Mini as using the much faster DDR3 1600Mhz sodimms. This is the fastest iMac RAM you can buy today.</p>

<p><strong>Where to Buy RAM for 2012 Apple iMac </strong></p>

<p>You can buy ram for iMac from pretty much any store that will sell and stock ddr3 1600mhz sodimms, but I suggest you buy RAM from the following memory stores for memory for the new Apple iMacs. One thing to note is that the 27 inch Apple iMacs can now accept 32GB of ram so you will need to buy 8GB memory modules x4. For the smaller screen iMacs, you are limited to a maximum of  16Gb and you can buy a 16GB memory upgrade kit or two 8GB iMac RAM kits or 4x4GB ddr3 1600 Mhz sodimms to get you to the maximum of 16GB allowed.</p>

<p>[table id=15 /]</p>

<p><strong>2011 Apple IMac RAM Types </strong></p>

<p>The now discontinued Apple iMacs (<a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-1548159-10847025"><strong><em>check here for some great deals</em></strong></a>) take the slower 1333mhz spec’d ddr3 sodimms so be sure to buy the right memory for the 2011 iMacs vs the 2012 iMacs that use faster memory. Like the smaller 2012 iMac models, all 2011 Apple iMacs can only accept up  to 16GB of RAM maximum. If  you want to install more than 16GB of RAM in a 2011 or older iMac – you can’t and will need to buy a 27 inch Apple iMac.</p>

<p>[table id=7 /]</p>

<p>For older iMac models,I recommend you check either <a href="http://www.lowendmac.com">lowendmac</a> or <a href="http://www.everymac.com">everymac</a> for ram specifications for the older Mac models as I tend to concentrating on getting you the best deals on iMac memory for new iMacs vs older iMacs.</p>

<p>Buy a Brand New 2012 iMac.</p>

<p>If you’re ready to buy a 2012 iMac I suggest you check <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;field-keywords=iMac&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;url=search-alias%3Daps"><strong>Amazon</strong></a> or <a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-1548159-10847025"><strong>MacMall</strong></a> for the best deals on a 2012 Apple iMac.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2012/11/what-is-the-best-value-usb-dac-for-2012/">What is the Best Value USB DAC for 2012?</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p><img class="alignnone" title="best usb dac for 2012" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/JIM_5414.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" /></p>

<p>One way to get better sound out of your computer or iPod  is to use an external DAC. A DAC, (digital audio converter) does what the description says it does: It translates digital audio to analog sound that is then amplified to your headphones (or loudspeakers) . In all but a few cases, the DAC inside your computer is not the best way to convert the digital signal from your audio files, regardless of whether they are in FLAC format, MP3 or Apple Lossless format the DAC inside your notebook or desktop computer is not going to be the best quality.</p>

<p>If you can now easily buy a brand new laptop for under $400, it only makes sense that the DAC isn’t going to be the best of quality. Then you also have to consider the noise inside the notebook computer from spinning hard drives (this is not really an issue with solid state drives thanks to the lack of moving parts on solid state drives), and all these factors add up to the fact that you’re not going get the best sound out of the headphone jack on your iPOd or notebook computer.</p>

<p>The solution to this is buy an external DAC for your notebook. You can spend silly money on a DAC  if you want, but one of the best DACs I have found (and am listening to right now as I write this) is the Fiio E7 portable headphone DAC. (<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/fiio-e7-portable-dac-and-headphone-amplifier-review/" title="Fiio E7 Portable DAC and Headphone Amplifier Review">see my review here</a>). This small DAC is about the size of a small deck of cards and yet features a much better quality chip inside of the small and battery powered DAC.</p>

<p>Using the Fiio E7 with an iPod is easy (buy the iPod adapter cable) and then connect the Fiio E7 to the connector on the bottom of your iPod and then plug your headphones into the DAC</p>

<p>If you want to connect the DAC to your computer, all you need is a USB cable that comes with the Fiio E7 and connect the DAC to the USB output (you’re going to have to configure your computer to output through the USB port) and then connect your headphones.</p>

<p>For the money,  (well under $100) this has to be one of the  best values in a small and portable DAC that is very flexible and can be used as a portable self powered DAC for your iPod,  a notebook computer DAC or if you buy an external amplifier, can also be used as a DAC for your desktop computer to. You really can’t find a more versatile DAC for listening to your digital files and getting much better sound quality in 2012.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2012/08/imac-shopping-i5-vs-i7-models/">iMac Shopping: i5 vs i7 models</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>While we hang around and wait for the 2012 Apple iMacs to show up, I thought I’d take a look at the current offerrings from Apple in the iMac department. I mean, afterall – I do track iMac memory prices – it only makes sense to learn all I can about the 2012 iMac.</p>

<h2 id="the-2012-imac-lineup">The 2012 iMac Lineup</h2>

<p> </p>

<p>Is really, the summer 2011 Apple iMacs as that’s the latest Apple iMac to come out of Apple. Except for MacBook Pro’s we haven’t seen one new computer from Apple this year. But seeing as how these are the best iMacs we’re going to see for a while it looks like, we may as well get to know <a href="http://www.apple.com/imac/">Apple’s best selling Apple Desktop computer. </a></p>

<h2 id="i5-apple-imacs">i5 Apple iMacs</h2>

<p><strong>Apple iMac 21.5 inch 2.5Gz</strong></p>

<p>This iMac is the cheapest Apple iMac you can buy today. Starting at just $1199.00, you get a 2.5Ghz Intel i5 processor, a 500gb hard drive and 4GB of RAM. (add more ram – see the prices to your right)</p>

<p><strong>Apple iMac 21.5 inch 2.7Ghz</strong></p>

<p>If you’ve got a bit more money to spend, it might be worth it to check out the 2.7Ghz i5 iMac. You get more speed, and a bigger 1TB hard drive for $300 more. (I still think the cheaper iMac is the better deal)</p>

<p><strong>Apple iMac 27 inch 2.7Ghz</strong></p>

<p>If I were going to spend any money on an iMac, this is where I would start. The bigger real estate is a welcome addition to my workflow, and the price difference isn’t that bad-you have to find another $500 from the starter iMac but you get a faster processor and 1TB hard drive. You’re paying t a premium for the iMac screen but I think it’s worth the cost</p>

<p><strong>Apple iMac 27 inch 3.1Ghz </strong></p>

<p>Unless you have money  to burn  I would stay away from this model. To me, the biggest iMac isn’t the best deal on an iMac when you compare the 3.1Ghz model to other iMac models in 2012.</p>

<h2 id="i7-apple-imacs">i7 Apple iMacs</h2>

<p>I wish. It turns out, there are no Apple iMacs available yet with faster i7 processors. There’s a complete selection of Apple i5 iMacs from which to choose but nope, no i7 Apple iMacs yet. Again, something to look forward to when Apple finally releases the 2012 Apple iMacs.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2012/08/do-i-need-to-buy-the-macbook-air-with-8gb-of-ram/">Do I Need To Buy The MacBook Air With 8GB of RAM?</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><div style="float: right; margin-right: 5px;">
  <p>
    &nbsp;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    &nbsp;
  </p>

  </p>
</div>

<p>I would buy the 8GB MacBook Air vs the 4GB MacBook Air – finances allowing, of course.</p>

<p>And here’s why: Initially, the 8GB MacBook Air will cost you more money, but over time if you keep your MacBook Air or even sell it down the road you get more value out of a MacBook Air with more ram than you would by buying a MacBook Air with less memory, even though short-term you can save money with a cheaper MacBook Air.</p>

<h2 id="a-8gb-macbook-air-is-a-better-deal">A 8GB Macbook Air is a Better Deal</h2>

<p>Let’s assume you only keep your MacBook Air for two years.</p>

<p>A 4GB MacBook Air costs $1199 for the 13inch MBA, yet the 8GB MacBook Air costs only $100 more bringing the total to $1299.00. That $100 difference is a small price to pay, especially when amortized over 2 years.</p>

<p>4GB MacBook Air – 1200/24 = 50.00 a month</p>

<p>8GB MacBook Air – 1300/24 = $54.17 a month.</p>

<p>For the price of one starbucks latte a month you can get into a MacBook Air with more RAM. Applications are only going to require more ram as browsers get more complicated, facebook starts to display larger photos, or if you’re into photo editing with Apple Aperture like I am you’ll definitely wish you bought the 8GB of RAM.</p>

<p>I would even skimp on hard drive space if I had a choice between buying more ram for my MacBook Air vs adding a bigger SSD storage. You can always add storage later externally. I find I need very little storage when it comes to using my portable computers as all my files are on external drives tethered to my Mac Mini.</p>

<h2 id="sell-the-8gb-macbook-air-for-more-money">Sell The 8GB MacBook Air for More Money</h2>

<p>Resale value is another thing to consider when thinking about buying a brand new MacBook Air. Using my 2 year estimate (at least that’s the amount my wife lets me upgrade – you may be single, or have a larger budget for Apple computers than I do) you’re looking at getting more value from your MacBook Air with more ram than you would with a MacBook Air with just 4GB.</p>

<p>Unlike the Apple MacBook Pro models, where you can add ram later on, the MacBook Air models do not offer a chance to later upgrade the memory so you’d better get your MacBook Air purchase right the first time and buy the MacBook Air with more ram. 8GB of ram in 2012 for the MacBook Air is not a lot of RAM with 16GB starting to be the standard for MacBook notebooks as we enter into 2013.</p>

<p>For the cost of a cup of coffee, I would buy the 8GB MacBook Air over the 4GB MacBook Air as I would find the extra four dollars a month it would cost me to buy the MacBook Air with more RAM.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2012/08/who-has-the-best-pc-memory-finder/">Who Has The Best PC Memory Finder?</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>If you’re looking to buy RAM for any of the best selling computer brands, one of the easiest ways to get the right ram for your PC is to use what is called a PC Memory Finder. This could also be known as a PC memory configurator, or PC memory helper, or PC Memory Menu even, but essentially a tool to help you decipher memory upgrades, because for folks like you and me, getting the right ram for your Mac or PC can be sometimes tricky.</p>

<h2 id="how-a-pc-memory-finder-works">How a PC Memory Finder Works</h2>

<p>You need to know just three things in order to use a PC Memory Finder and they are:</p>

<p>You computer brand. What brand of computer do you have? Dell? Apple? HP? Sony? Usually you select your computer brand and then continue to the next step.</p>

<p>Your Computer Model or Group. If you have an Apple MacBook Pro you would select MacBook Pro, for instance.</p>

<p>Your Computer Model Number or Name. Because computers come in sooo many sizes and shapes you need to know your computers model number. For Apple, that may be Apple MacBook Pro Retina Display Spring 2012, or a Dell Inspiron N5040, whatever you need to specify exactly what computer you need.</p>

<p>That’s it. Once you have these 3 pieces of information, you’re presented with a list of compatible memory upgrades and usually the vendor’s web page will supply other pertinent information in regards to your specific computer model – like how many memory slots your computer has, or how much the maximum ram your PC can use and recognize.</p>

<p>You then pick the right ram for your PC. I suggest buying the maximum memory for your PC to enhance performance to the maximum.</p>

<h2 id="the-best-pc-memory-finder"><strong>The Best PC Memory Finder</strong></h2>

<p>I like the <a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-1548159-10273954"><strong>PC Memory Finder at Crucial</strong></a> the best out off all the computer memory finders available online – not only do you get name brand memory upgrades with a gaurantee that the ram is the right ram for you computer, you also get recommendations for hard drives compatible with your computer too allowing you to upgrade the hard drive for your PC at the same time. A hard drive and ram upgrade is one way to extend the life of your current computer without having to buy a brand new computer which can be more expensive than upgrading the computer you already have.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2012/08/where-to-buy-memory-cards-for-digital-cameras/">Where To Buy Memory Cards for Digital Cameras</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p><strong>Memory cards for digital cameras</strong>. If you don’t have one(or more) you are dead in the water and your <a href="http://www.camerahelpers.com" title="best digital camera">fancy digital camera might</a> as well be a door stop, or conversation piece for your coffee table. A digital camera memory card is to a digital camera or DSLR, what a roll of film or kodachrome (RIP) was to film cameras back in the day.</p>

<h2 id="what-kind-of-memory-cards-for-digital-cameras-do-i-need"><strong>What Kind of Memory Cards for Digital Cameras Do I Need? </strong></h2>

<p>For most of us memory cards for cameras in 2012 come in two different forms: compact flash and SDHC memory cards. The former tend to be used with higher end DSLR’s (My Nikon D300 takes compact flash) while the latter is mostly used in compact or more consumer based DSLR’s. One of the benefits of the SDHC cards over the compact flash is that they tend to be more compatible with other devices too and there’s a good chance your notebook Mac or PC will include a SDHC memory card reader built into the notebook, avoiding the need to use or carry an external memory card reader.</p>

<p>There are a few memory card types from Sony that tend to be less mainstream – their memorystick technology never really took the world by storm and it’s too soon to see if the Sony XQD technology will become mainstream. Right now, this is a very expensive memory card.</p>

<h2 id="what-about-memory-card-speed">What About Memory Card Speed?</h2>

<p>Like a lot of things in the technology world – the faster the better, and this applies to memory cards too as the faster the card the faster your camera can write the file to the card and is ready to take the next shot. The last thing you want to do is be left waiting while your memory card writes your file(s) to your memory card. Common speeds are 45Mb/s for SDHC memory cards and 30 to 90 MB/s for compact flash memory cards.</p>

<h2 id="what-size-of-memory-card-should-i-buy-for-my-digital-camera">What Size of Memory Card Should I Buy For My Digital Camera?</h2>

<p>I like to buy the biggest memory card I can buy for the best price I can find online. This may require some time and patience but you can get some really good deals on camera memory if you shop around. I tend to shoot JPEG vs RAW so my space requirements are much less than a RAW shooter with a high megapixel digital camera. I have an 8GB card in my Nikon D300 that’s been just fine for years, and I have never run out of room.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2012/08/when-will-the-2012-mac-mini-release-date-be/">When Will The 2012 Mac Mini Release Date Be?</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>I am writing this on a** 2011 Apple Mac Mini<strong>. It’s the higher end model, and my wife works with the l</strong>ower end model too<strong>. We’re a Mac Mini family. But both of these apple Mac Minis were released in 2011, not this year – and that means they are a year old now, <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/is-applecare-for-a-2011-macbook-pro-worth-it/" title="Is AppleCare Worth It for A MacBook Pro?">out of warranty</a> and slowly becoming obsolete. We would love to buy new Apple Mac Mini’s but there’s one problem. Apple has not released them yet. The only brand new Apple computer we have seen is the **MacBook Pro Retina</strong> display, and even that model is a few months old now</p>

<h2 id="when-i-think-the-mac-mini-release-date-will-be"><strong>When I think the Mac Mini Release Date Will Be</strong></h2>

<p>The Apple Mac Mini is one of the more popular computers due to the fact that they are the cheapest Apple Mac you can buy. They are not the Apple computer under $500, but they are close. If you shop around you can buy a Mac Mini for a small discount  – about $35.00 on <strong>Amazon</strong>, <strong>MacMall</strong> or** Best Buy** for even less than the Apple Store charges. And speaking of the Apple Store, one way to get a cheap Mac Mini is to check the <a href="http://store.apple.com/us/browse/home/specialdeals/mac/mac_mini"><strong>refurbished Apple Mac Mini section</strong></a> on the Apple Store online. It’s hit and miss with stock, but if you’re willing to wait this is the only way to buy a Mac under $500.00.</p>

<p>Another reason for the popularity of the Mac MIni is the fact that these make excellent home theater or audio servers. You don’t need fancy software of any kind. All you need is the free iTunes and some sort of wireless connector for your TV or stereo – usually in the form of an <strong>airport express</strong> or <strong>Apple TV</strong>. You don’t need a monitor once you’ve got the Mac Mini set up for serving your movie and music files and you can control the Mac Mini via your Apple iPhone thanks to the free Apple remote software.</p>

<p>All this said, there’s more than one computer from Apple we’re waiting for we haven’t seen a release date for the iMac either yet, or the Mac Pro yet too. All the rumors for the Mac Pro seem to state 2013 for it, but we could see a brand new <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/when-will-the-imac-2012-release-date-be/" title="When Will The iMac 2012 Release Date Be?">Apple iMac release as early as September 2012.</a> We’re already into the end of August, so that doesn ‘t leave much time and Apple usually refreshes the iPod line in the fall too to grab a good share of the holiday shopping season. We might even see an iPad 4 by the end of the year too.</p>

<p>So when to squeeze a Mac Mini release into all that? The Mac Mini would be a better choice than a new iMac release due to the cost and use as a media servier so I think that this will come first. When, I have no idea but my guess would be either late fall or early in January 2013 we should see a faster processor (probably the same as the MacBook Pro’s) and probably a ram increase too to <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/mac-mini-ddr3-memory-upgrade-prices/">8GB of RAM</a> with a maximum of 16GB for the Mac Mini instead of the current 8GB maximum Apple recommends.</p>

<p>Of course, I could be wrong with all of this and Apple could wait until later in 2013 and continue to sell the best selling computer in their lineup, the MacBook Pro and MacBook Air, as these are 2012 Apple computers already. Like a lot of things in life, only time will tell <strong>when the final release date for the Apple Mac Mini</strong> will be.</p>
