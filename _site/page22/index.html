    <h1><a href="/2012/11/how-to-upgrade-flash-memory/">How To Upgrade Flash Memory</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>Flash Memory is becoming the defacto memory standard of 2012 and int0 2013 with products from digital cameras to notebook computers and even smartphones using flash memory upgrades for more storage for your data. Flash memory comes in many different form factors depending on the device you want to use flash memory for but  below are some of the more common flash memory upgrades on sale today:</p>

<h2 id="solid-state-drives">Solid State Drives</h2>

<p>Solid state hard drives have become the standard hard drive installed in many new notebook  computers (and to a lesser extent, desktop computers too) thanks to advancements in manufacturing and more demand for the much faster flash storage that SSD drives offer. At time of writing, one can buy a 128GB SSD drive for less than $100 and 256GB SSD drives  can be had for under $200.00. What was once a luxury on the leading edge is becoming more mainstream each and every day. SSD drives offer no moving parts, much faster read and write times and startup times than even the fastest standard drive. The disadvantage to the SSD drive is that larger capacity SSD’s at 512GB and up are still much more expensive than traditional hard drives in the same capacity</p>

<h2 id="compact-flash-memory">Compact Flash Memory</h2>

<p>Compact Flash Memory is usually used in more advanced digital cameras such as pro-sumer or  professional DSLR’s and offer faster read and write times than SDHC memory cards can offer that are smaller in size and more popular in compact digital cameras and other devices. Compact Flash memory upgrades are available in a wide array of sizes in speeds but common and best selling compact flash memory upgrades are 32GB  and up to 400x in speed.</p>

<h2 id="sdhc-memory">SDHC Memory</h2>

<p>SDHC memory is available in many sizes. The standard micro SDHC memory cards are a favorite for digital camera and computer users thanks to their smaller size when compared to compact flash memory upgrades.  Micro SD memory cards are also a very popular choice for cellular and smartphones and it’s hard to imagine that storage space of up to 64GB can fit on a memory card smaller than your fingernail.</p>

<h2 id="usb-flash-memory">USB Flash Memory</h2>

<p>These might be the most popular types of flash memory and grace many a keychain or computer users desktop. With many shapes and sizes these USB drives or thumb drives come in a variety of  shapes and sizes from standard design to novelty designs shaped like teddy bears. USB flash memory is a popular marketing tool thanks to the fact that you can buy USB flash drives with your  company message screen printed on the flash drive itself. With a cost of under $1.00 each in  some cases, customized usb flash memory drives are a great way to promote your  company and your message or logo.</p>

<h2 id="where-to-buy-flash-memory-upgrades">Where To Buy Flash Memory Upgrades</h2>

<p>All of these types of flash memory upgrades are available at numerous stores online but I find one of the best places to buy flash memory of any kind is at Amazon. They constantly have the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957"><strong>lowest prices on flash memory</strong></a> regardless of type or size.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2012/11/cheap-computer-memory-upgrades-where-to-buy/">Cheap Computer Memory Upgrades: Where To Buy</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>If you’re looking to buy cheap computer memory, you’ve come to the right place because all I do every day is help you get the cheapest computer memory prices possible and I have been monitoring and tracking cheap computer memory prices for over 15 year now. If you’re in the market for cheap memory I list prices that are the lowest I could find.</p>

<h2 id="cheap-apple-computer-memory"><strong>Cheap Apple Computer Memory</strong></h2>

<p>I started ramseeker tracking ram prices for just Apple computers so if there’s one thing I know, it’s where to get computer memory for Apple computers cheaply. In 2012, almost all current Apple computers take the same amount of RAM. Mac Mini, MacBook Pro and Apple iMac all use  DDR3 1600Mhz  SDRAM sodimms. Here are the lowest prices on Apple Memory I could find:</p>

<p>[table id=15 /]</p>

<h2 id="cheap-hp-computer-memory"><strong>Cheap HP Computer Memory</strong></h2>

<p>Memory for HP notebooks are another type of memory you can get cheaply now and like the Apple products, most HP notebooks like the HP Envy will allow up to 16GB of RAM installed and not only is HP memory cheap, but  it will allow you to work much faster regardless of whether you use your HP notebook for fun or business.</p>

<p>[table id=15 /]</p>

<h2 id="cheap-dell-computer-memory">Cheap Dell Computer Memory</h2>

<p>Dell Inspirons, XPS or Latitude models all take more ram and like the HP and Apple’s above you can get ram much much cheaper when you buy the memory anywhere but from Dell which tends to overcharge for their memory upgrades. You’re much better off buying ram from one of the memory stores below. When you do, not only will you save money on RAM, your dell will run faster and allow you to open more applications at the same time. Most Dell notebooks this year can accept up to 16GB of RAM. Check your manual .</p>

<p>[table id=15 /]</p>

<p> </p>

<h2 id="cheap-sony-computer-memory">Cheap Sony Computer Memory</h2>

<p>Sony computers are usually not known for being the cheapest computer you can buy, unless you get a deal on a Sony notebook  most  Sony VAIO models tend to be expensive than their DEll or HP counterparts.  But just because the Sony notebook is pricey doesn’t mean you can’t  get ram for Sony notebook computers cheaply. Most Sony’s can accept  up  to 16GB of RAM and installing ram in a Sony notebook is easy and cheap when you buy ram for Sony Notebooks from these stores:</p>

<p>[table id=15 /]</p>

<h2 id="where-to-buy-cheap-computer-memory-upgrades">Where To Buy Cheap Computer Memory Upgrades</h2>

<p>In addition to the memory stores in the pricing tables above,  I like buying cheap memory from Amazon as a lot of times they tend to have better prices on RAM than any other memory store and offer not only the cheapest computer memory prices but outstanding return policies too. Here are some suggestions for cheap computer memory:</p>

    <h1><a href="/2012/11/where-to-buy-imac-ram/">Where To Buy iMac RAM</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>The iMacs in 2012 are becoming one of the most popular Apple desktops to be released this year for a few reasons: First, the design is even slimmer for the new Apple iMacs vs the 2011 Apple iMacs, and secondly you can upgrade some of the higher end iMac models all the way to 32GB, which is double the ram capacity for older iMacs from laster year. The ram upgrade chart for the current iMacs look like this:<img class="size-full wp-image-6672 alignnone" title="where to buy iMac RAM" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Screen-Shot-2012-11-05-at-3.10.27-PM.png" alt="" width="837" height="744" /></p>

<h3 id="ghz-apple-imac-215-inch-screen">2.7GHz Apple iMac 21.5 inch Screen</h3>

<p>This iMac ships from the factory with just 8GB of ram installed (4GBX2), but you can max out the ram on this iMac model and I suggest you do because iMac ram is so cheap this year.</p>

<h3 id="ghz-apple-imac-215-inch-screen-1">2.9GHz Apple iMac 21.5 inch Screen</h3>

<p>This iMac is the same specifications when it comes to memory – you still start with 8GB of iMac ram from Apple, but you can max out the ram on this iMac to 16GB</p>

<h3 id="ghz-apple-imac-27-inch-screen">2.9GHz Apple iMac 27 inch Screen</h3>

<p>If you cough up big money for the 27 inches of screen real estate, you not only get a bigger display, you also get more memory capacity – but if you add 8GB of ram x 4 you can max out the memory on the new Apple iMacs all the way to 32GB of RAM – one of the first Apple iMacs able to accept 32GB of RAM</p>

<h3 id="ghz-apple-imac-27-inch-screen-1">3.2GHz Apple iMac 27 inch Screen</h3>

<p>The fastest Apple iMac also requires the same ram as the other 27 inch Apple computer and will also accept 32GB of ram in the four memory upgrade slots the Apple iMac has.</p>

<h2 id="where-to-buy-imac-ram">Where To Buy iMac RAM</h2>

<p>All of the Apple iMac models above require the newest in Apple memory technology  – and that’s DDR3 1600Mhz sodimms.  The sodimms are considered notebook ram but the iMac, despite the desktop form factor does require the smaller sodimm for notebook compters vs the SDRAM DIMM designed for desktops computers.</p>

<p>The prices for iMac RAM continue to drop over the years and in fact the memory for iMacs have been the best deal I have ever seen on Apple iMac memory. Below are the best prices on iMac RAM and the memory stores where you can buy iMac RAM.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2012/11/what-ram-do-i-need-for-apple-imac/">What RAM Do I Need for Apple iMac?</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>One of the best ways to find out exactly what ram you need for your iMac is to use a memory configurator to get the best ram prices for iMac that you know will work. You also don’t have to guess with charts and tables either. All you have to do is choose your brand (Apple, obviously) what Apple iMac you have (2010, 2012, processor speed, screen size ) and the memory configurator will then tell you exactly what RAM you need to buy for your Apple iMac.</p>

<p><strong>2012 Apple iMac RAM Types </strong></p>

<p>The 2012 iMacs were just released in late October 2012 and now join the MacBook Pro models and the Mac Mini as using the much faster DDR3 1600Mhz sodimms. This is the fastest iMac RAM you can buy today.</p>

<p><strong>Where to Buy RAM for 2012 Apple iMac </strong></p>

<p>You can buy ram for iMac from pretty much any store that will sell and stock ddr3 1600mhz sodimms, but I suggest you buy RAM from the following memory stores for memory for the new Apple iMacs. One thing to note is that the 27 inch Apple iMacs can now accept 32GB of ram so you will need to buy 8GB memory modules x4. For the smaller screen iMacs, you are limited to a maximum of  16Gb and you can buy a 16GB memory upgrade kit or two 8GB iMac RAM kits or 4x4GB ddr3 1600 Mhz sodimms to get you to the maximum of 16GB allowed.</p>

<p>[table id=15 /]</p>

<p><strong>2011 Apple IMac RAM Types </strong></p>

<p>The now discontinued Apple iMacs (<a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-1548159-10847025"><strong><em>check here for some great deals</em></strong></a>) take the slower 1333mhz spec’d ddr3 sodimms so be sure to buy the right memory for the 2011 iMacs vs the 2012 iMacs that use faster memory. Like the smaller 2012 iMac models, all 2011 Apple iMacs can only accept up  to 16GB of RAM maximum. If  you want to install more than 16GB of RAM in a 2011 or older iMac – you can’t and will need to buy a 27 inch Apple iMac.</p>

<p>[table id=7 /]</p>

<p>For older iMac models,I recommend you check either <a href="http://www.lowendmac.com">lowendmac</a> or <a href="http://www.everymac.com">everymac</a> for ram specifications for the older Mac models as I tend to concentrating on getting you the best deals on iMac memory for new iMacs vs older iMacs.</p>

<p>Buy a Brand New 2012 iMac.</p>

<p>If you’re ready to buy a 2012 iMac I suggest you check <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;field-keywords=iMac&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;url=search-alias%3Daps"><strong>Amazon</strong></a> or <a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-1548159-10847025"><strong>MacMall</strong></a> for the best deals on a 2012 Apple iMac.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2012/11/what-is-the-best-value-usb-dac-for-2012/">What is the Best Value USB DAC for 2012?</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p><img class="alignnone" title="best usb dac for 2012" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/JIM_5414.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" /></p>

<p>One way to get better sound out of your computer or iPod  is to use an external DAC. A DAC, (digital audio converter) does what the description says it does: It translates digital audio to analog sound that is then amplified to your headphones (or loudspeakers) . In all but a few cases, the DAC inside your computer is not the best way to convert the digital signal from your audio files, regardless of whether they are in FLAC format, MP3 or Apple Lossless format the DAC inside your notebook or desktop computer is not going to be the best quality.</p>

<p>If you can now easily buy a brand new laptop for under $400, it only makes sense that the DAC isn’t going to be the best of quality. Then you also have to consider the noise inside the notebook computer from spinning hard drives (this is not really an issue with solid state drives thanks to the lack of moving parts on solid state drives), and all these factors add up to the fact that you’re not going get the best sound out of the headphone jack on your iPOd or notebook computer.</p>

<p>The solution to this is buy an external DAC for your notebook. You can spend silly money on a DAC  if you want, but one of the best DACs I have found (and am listening to right now as I write this) is the Fiio E7 portable headphone DAC. (<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/fiio-e7-portable-dac-and-headphone-amplifier-review/" title="Fiio E7 Portable DAC and Headphone Amplifier Review">see my review here</a>). This small DAC is about the size of a small deck of cards and yet features a much better quality chip inside of the small and battery powered DAC.</p>

<p>Using the Fiio E7 with an iPod is easy (buy the iPod adapter cable) and then connect the Fiio E7 to the connector on the bottom of your iPod and then plug your headphones into the DAC</p>

<p>If you want to connect the DAC to your computer, all you need is a USB cable that comes with the Fiio E7 and connect the DAC to the USB output (you’re going to have to configure your computer to output through the USB port) and then connect your headphones.</p>

<p>For the money,  (well under $100) this has to be one of the  best values in a small and portable DAC that is very flexible and can be used as a portable self powered DAC for your iPod,  a notebook computer DAC or if you buy an external amplifier, can also be used as a DAC for your desktop computer to. You really can’t find a more versatile DAC for listening to your digital files and getting much better sound quality in 2012.</p>

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>While we hang around and wait for the 2012 Apple iMacs to show up, I thought I’d take a look at the current offerrings from Apple in the iMac department. I mean, afterall – I do track iMac memory prices – it only makes sense to learn all I can about the 2012 iMac.</p>

<h2 id="the-2012-imac-lineup">The 2012 iMac Lineup</h2>

<p> </p>

<p>Is really, the summer 2011 Apple iMacs as that’s the latest Apple iMac to come out of Apple. Except for MacBook Pro’s we haven’t seen one new computer from Apple this year. But seeing as how these are the best iMacs we’re going to see for a while it looks like, we may as well get to know <a href="http://www.apple.com/imac/">Apple’s best selling Apple Desktop computer. </a></p>

<h2 id="i5-apple-imacs">i5 Apple iMacs</h2>

<p><strong>Apple iMac 21.5 inch 2.5Gz</strong></p>

<p>This iMac is the cheapest Apple iMac you can buy today. Starting at just $1199.00, you get a 2.5Ghz Intel i5 processor, a 500gb hard drive and 4GB of RAM. (add more ram – see the prices to your right)</p>

<p><strong>Apple iMac 21.5 inch 2.7Ghz</strong></p>

<p>If you’ve got a bit more money to spend, it might be worth it to check out the 2.7Ghz i5 iMac. You get more speed, and a bigger 1TB hard drive for $300 more. (I still think the cheaper iMac is the better deal)</p>

<p><strong>Apple iMac 27 inch 2.7Ghz</strong></p>

<p>If I were going to spend any money on an iMac, this is where I would start. The bigger real estate is a welcome addition to my workflow, and the price difference isn’t that bad-you have to find another $500 from the starter iMac but you get a faster processor and 1TB hard drive. You’re paying t a premium for the iMac screen but I think it’s worth the cost</p>

<p><strong>Apple iMac 27 inch 3.1Ghz </strong></p>

<p>Unless you have money  to burn  I would stay away from this model. To me, the biggest iMac isn’t the best deal on an iMac when you compare the 3.1Ghz model to other iMac models in 2012.</p>

<h2 id="i7-apple-imacs">i7 Apple iMacs</h2>

<p>I wish. It turns out, there are no Apple iMacs available yet with faster i7 processors. There’s a complete selection of Apple i5 iMacs from which to choose but nope, no i7 Apple iMacs yet. Again, something to look forward to when Apple finally releases the 2012 Apple iMacs.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2012/08/do-i-need-to-buy-the-macbook-air-with-8gb-of-ram/">Do I Need To Buy The MacBook Air With 8GB of RAM?</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><div style="float: right; margin-right: 5px;">
  <p>
    &nbsp;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    &nbsp;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    &nbsp;
  </p>
</div>

<p>I would buy the 8GB MacBook Air vs the 4GB MacBook Air – finances allowing, of course.</p>

<p>And here’s why: Initially, the 8GB MacBook Air will cost you more money, but over time if you keep your MacBook Air or even sell it down the road you get more value out of a MacBook Air with more ram than you would by buying a MacBook Air with less memory, even though short-term you can save money with a cheaper MacBook Air.</p>

<h2 id="a-8gb-macbook-air-is-a-better-deal">A 8GB Macbook Air is a Better Deal</h2>

<p>Let’s assume you only keep your MacBook Air for two years.</p>

<p>A 4GB MacBook Air costs $1199 for the 13inch MBA, yet the 8GB MacBook Air costs only $100 more bringing the total to $1299.00. That $100 difference is a small price to pay, especially when amortized over 2 years.</p>

<p>4GB MacBook Air – 1200/24 = 50.00 a month</p>

<p>8GB MacBook Air – 1300/24 = $54.17 a month.</p>

<p>For the price of one starbucks latte a month you can get into a MacBook Air with more RAM. Applications are only going to require more ram as browsers get more complicated, facebook starts to display larger photos, or if you’re into photo editing with Apple Aperture like I am you’ll definitely wish you bought the 8GB of RAM.</p>

<p>I would even skimp on hard drive space if I had a choice between buying more ram for my MacBook Air vs adding a bigger SSD storage. You can always add storage later externally. I find I need very little storage when it comes to using my portable computers as all my files are on external drives tethered to my Mac Mini.</p>

<h2 id="sell-the-8gb-macbook-air-for-more-money">Sell The 8GB MacBook Air for More Money</h2>

<p>Resale value is another thing to consider when thinking about buying a brand new MacBook Air. Using my 2 year estimate (at least that’s the amount my wife lets me upgrade – you may be single, or have a larger budget for Apple computers than I do) you’re looking at getting more value from your MacBook Air with more ram than you would with a MacBook Air with just 4GB.</p>

<p>Unlike the Apple MacBook Pro models, where you can add ram later on, the MacBook Air models do not offer a chance to later upgrade the memory so you’d better get your MacBook Air purchase right the first time and buy the MacBook Air with more ram. 8GB of ram in 2012 for the MacBook Air is not a lot of RAM with 16GB starting to be the standard for MacBook notebooks as we enter into 2013.</p>

<p>For the cost of a cup of coffee, I would buy the 8GB MacBook Air over the 4GB MacBook Air as I would find the extra four dollars a month it would cost me to buy the MacBook Air with more RAM.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2012/08/who-has-the-best-pc-memory-finder/">Who Has The Best PC Memory Finder?</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>If you’re looking to buy RAM for any of the best selling computer brands, one of the easiest ways to get the right ram for your PC is to use what is called a PC Memory Finder. This could also be known as a PC memory configurator, or PC memory helper, or PC Memory Menu even, but essentially a tool to help you decipher memory upgrades, because for folks like you and me, getting the right ram for your Mac or PC can be sometimes tricky.</p>

<h2 id="how-a-pc-memory-finder-works">How a PC Memory Finder Works</h2>

<p>You need to know just three things in order to use a PC Memory Finder and they are:</p>

<p>You computer brand. What brand of computer do you have? Dell? Apple? HP? Sony? Usually you select your computer brand and then continue to the next step.</p>

<p>Your Computer Model or Group. If you have an Apple MacBook Pro you would select MacBook Pro, for instance.</p>

<p>Your Computer Model Number or Name. Because computers come in sooo many sizes and shapes you need to know your computers model number. For Apple, that may be Apple MacBook Pro Retina Display Spring 2012, or a Dell Inspiron N5040, whatever you need to specify exactly what computer you need.</p>

<p>That’s it. Once you have these 3 pieces of information, you’re presented with a list of compatible memory upgrades and usually the vendor’s web page will supply other pertinent information in regards to your specific computer model – like how many memory slots your computer has, or how much the maximum ram your PC can use and recognize.</p>

<p>You then pick the right ram for your PC. I suggest buying the maximum memory for your PC to enhance performance to the maximum.</p>

<h2 id="the-best-pc-memory-finder"><strong>The Best PC Memory Finder</strong></h2>

<p>I like the <a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-1548159-10273954"><strong>PC Memory Finder at Crucial</strong></a> the best out off all the computer memory finders available online – not only do you get name brand memory upgrades with a gaurantee that the ram is the right ram for you computer, you also get recommendations for hard drives compatible with your computer too allowing you to upgrade the hard drive for your PC at the same time. A hard drive and ram upgrade is one way to extend the life of your current computer without having to buy a brand new computer which can be more expensive than upgrading the computer you already have.</p>
