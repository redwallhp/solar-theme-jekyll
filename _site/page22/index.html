    <h1><a href="/2012/11/how-to-get-a-free-pc-memory-test/">How To Get a Free PC Memory Test</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>PC Memory, in rare instances can go bad. RAM Memory is a very sensitive computer component that is susceptible to static electicity that can fry your memory very quickly, so it’s always a good idea to use an anti-static wristband and install ram in a humid environment to reduce the chance of static electricity. But even if you install the memory correctly you can still have problems with your PC memory but thankfully there are many methods to test your PC memory for any errors.</p>

<h2 id="remove-the-memory">Remove the Memory</h2>

<p>This seems kindof obvious I know, but one way to test ram to see if it’s bad is to remove and replace the memory upgrade with another memory chip. Usually, you have upgraded the ram in your PC with newer and larger memory upgrade modules, and if you still have the original factory installed memory upgrades all you have to do is replace the ram you suspect has gone bad with the older RAM. If your PC now runs without incident, then you know the RAM is bad and will have to be replaced. In the event of problems with your PC you should check your RAM for any problems</p>

<h2 id="free-pc-memory-testing-software">Free PC Memory Testing Software</h2>

<p>You don’t have to remove the ram you think has gone bad. There are many software programs that will allow you to test the memory in your PC without having to replace it to diagnose the memory problems:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.memtest86.com/"><strong>Memtest86</strong></a></p>

<p>This software is free software that allows you to test your PC ram for any errors. It’s easy to use and is a free download. This memory testing software does not require any software installed on the PC to run. Just download the ISO and using your  CD burning software. Easy to use, and diagnose any memory problems with this free memory testing software</p>

<p><a href="http://www.softpedia.com/get/Tweak/Memory-Tweak/Microsoft-Windows-Memory-Diagnostic.shtml"><strong>Windows Memory Diagnostic</strong></a></p>

<p>This memory testing software is like Memtest86 above, as it does not require an operating system to run and will run on any PC. Just download the ISO and follow the instructions to burn a bootable CD to test your PC memory with the Windows Memory Diagnostic Tool</p>

<p><a href="http://www.memtest.org/"><strong>MemTest86+</strong></a></p>

<p>Note the plus sign at the end. This is newer memory testing software that tests for memory module failure. Download the ISO, burn to a CD and you can test the memory on your PC with ease with MemTest86+</p>

<p>These are just three of the memory testing software for your PC. One other way to be certain your PC memory is error free is to buy brand name memory or ram from a trusted memory manufacturer like Crucial, Corsair, or Kingston Memory. All these manufacturers offer a lifetime replacement guarantee in the event that your memory upgrade goes bad. Below are some of the more popular memory upgrades available on sale today:</p>

    <h1><a href="/2012/11/where-to-buy-micron-technology-ram-and-flash-memory-upgrades/">Where To Buy Micron Technology RAM and Flash Memory Upgrades</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>Micron Technology has been manufacturing ram and more recently flash memory products since the early 1980’s and at one point actually sold micron branded memory upgrades. But in 2012, Micron Technology sells most of the memory and flash memory they manufacture under two brand names:</p>

<h2 id="crucial-technology1"><strong><a href="http://www.crucial.com">Crucial Technology</a></strong></h2>

<hr />
<p>Crucial Technology is one of the best memory upgrade brands you can buy and have been selling memory upgrades online for over 15 years now (at least as long as I have been tracking and monitoring ram prices.</p>

<p>One of the main features of Crucial Technology is the number of tools they offer to help you get the right memory upgrade for your computer regardless of make or computer brand. Using either the memory configurator where you select the Make and Model of your computer, or the application you can download that scans your computer for the right memory upgrade for you Mac or PC.</p>

<p>Popular memory upgrades are just a mouse click away for Apple, Dell, HP and Sony computer memory upgrades</p>

<p>In recent times as demand for memory upgrades have declined, Crucial Technology have expanded their product line to include both traditional and solid state hard drives as the prices for solid state hard drives continue to drop it’s now possible and affordable to replace the standard hard drive in your notebook or desktop computer with a much faster solid state hard drive. In some cases, a SSD drive upgrade can cost less than $100.</p>

<h2 id="lexar2"><strong><a href="http://www.lexar.com">Lexar</a></strong></h2>

<p>Lexar is the flash technology site for Micron Technology. Where the Crucial Brand is all about desktop and notebook upgrades, Lexar offers flash memory common in digital camera memory and USB flash drives that have become a must have computer accessory for transferring data from one computer to another. Some of the more popular flash memory products from  Lexar include compact flash memory, micro SDHC memory, and USB flash drives with capacity up to 64GB available today.</p>

<h2 id="where-to-buy-micron-technology-memory-products"><strong>Where to Buy Micron Technology Memory Products</strong></h2>

    <h1><a href="/2012/11/what-is-dual-channel-memory/">What is Dual Channel Memory?</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>Dual Channel Memory is commonly known as DDR or DDR2 memory and usually ships in two distinct sizes: SDRAM DDR2 DIMMS for desktop computers and DDR2 SDRAM sodimms for notebook computers. Speeds for DDR2 memory range from PC-3200 to PC-6400. In 2012, DDR2 dual channel memory is not the fastest DDR memory you can buy with DDR3 technology up tp 1600Mhz and beyond being the most popular DDR memory upgrades today. DDR2 memory upgrades were more popular from the period of about 2005 to 2008 when they were replaced with the much faster DDR3 memory standard.</p>

<h2 id="how-dual-channel-memory-works"><strong>How Dual Channel Memory Works</strong></h2>

<p>Dual Channel Memory is usually installed in pairs, and refers to the fact that the DDR or DDR2 memory is used on the moterboard. With two memory slots on a DDR2 motherboard available for memory upgrades, when DDR2 or even DDR memory is installed the computer can process memory data twice as fast as the DDR standard. The dual channel allow for one memory bank to read and write data while the next memory bank is getting ready for the next stream of data. This eliminates wait time as one memory bank is always ready for the next stream of data, effectively doubling the read and write timings. To gain the advantage that DDR2 memory upgrades offer, it is recommended that you install DDR2 memory upgrades in matched pairs for the most reliable computing experience.</p>

<h2 id="most-popular-ddr2-memory-brands">Most Popular DDR2 Memory Brands</h2>

<p>DDR2 dual channel memory is available in both generic memory where the memory vendor manufactures or resells the memory and the warranty for DDR2 generic memory depends on the vendor or  you can buy name brand DDR2 memory upgrades from a wide array of computer memory manufacturers: Crucial Technology, Kingston Technology and Corsair Memory are just a few DDR2 memory upgrade manufacturers that offer brand name memory and warranty support for dual channel memory upgrades.</p>

<h2 id="where-to-buy-dual-channel-memory">Where To  Buy Dual Channel Memory</h2>

<p>You can buy dual channel memory from a wide array of memory vendors (see my list of memory stores bel0w) but some of the best prices and  cheapest dual channel memory upgrades tend to be found online at Amazon. Below are a few examples:</p>

    <h1><a href="/2012/11/how-to-upgrade-flash-memory/">How To Upgrade Flash Memory</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>Flash Memory is becoming the defacto memory standard of 2012 and int0 2013 with products from digital cameras to notebook computers and even smartphones using flash memory upgrades for more storage for your data. Flash memory comes in many different form factors depending on the device you want to use flash memory for but  below are some of the more common flash memory upgrades on sale today:</p>

<h2 id="solid-state-drives">Solid State Drives</h2>

<p>Solid state hard drives have become the standard hard drive installed in many new notebook  computers (and to a lesser extent, desktop computers too) thanks to advancements in manufacturing and more demand for the much faster flash storage that SSD drives offer. At time of writing, one can buy a 128GB SSD drive for less than $100 and 256GB SSD drives  can be had for under $200.00. What was once a luxury on the leading edge is becoming more mainstream each and every day. SSD drives offer no moving parts, much faster read and write times and startup times than even the fastest standard drive. The disadvantage to the SSD drive is that larger capacity SSD’s at 512GB and up are still much more expensive than traditional hard drives in the same capacity</p>

<h2 id="compact-flash-memory">Compact Flash Memory</h2>

<p>Compact Flash Memory is usually used in more advanced digital cameras such as pro-sumer or  professional DSLR’s and offer faster read and write times than SDHC memory cards can offer that are smaller in size and more popular in compact digital cameras and other devices. Compact Flash memory upgrades are available in a wide array of sizes in speeds but common and best selling compact flash memory upgrades are 32GB  and up to 400x in speed.</p>

<h2 id="sdhc-memory">SDHC Memory</h2>

<p>SDHC memory is available in many sizes. The standard micro SDHC memory cards are a favorite for digital camera and computer users thanks to their smaller size when compared to compact flash memory upgrades.  Micro SD memory cards are also a very popular choice for cellular and smartphones and it’s hard to imagine that storage space of up to 64GB can fit on a memory card smaller than your fingernail.</p>

<h2 id="usb-flash-memory">USB Flash Memory</h2>

<p>These might be the most popular types of flash memory and grace many a keychain or computer users desktop. With many shapes and sizes these USB drives or thumb drives come in a variety of  shapes and sizes from standard design to novelty designs shaped like teddy bears. USB flash memory is a popular marketing tool thanks to the fact that you can buy USB flash drives with your  company message screen printed on the flash drive itself. With a cost of under $1.00 each in  some cases, customized usb flash memory drives are a great way to promote your  company and your message or logo.</p>

<h2 id="where-to-buy-flash-memory-upgrades">Where To Buy Flash Memory Upgrades</h2>

<p>All of these types of flash memory upgrades are available at numerous stores online but I find one of the best places to buy flash memory of any kind is at Amazon. They constantly have the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957"><strong>lowest prices on flash memory</strong></a> regardless of type or size.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2012/11/cheap-computer-memory-upgrades-where-to-buy/">Cheap Computer Memory Upgrades: Where To Buy</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>If you’re looking to buy cheap computer memory, you’ve come to the right place because all I do every day is help you get the cheapest computer memory prices possible and I have been monitoring and tracking cheap computer memory prices for over 15 year now. If you’re in the market for cheap memory I list prices that are the lowest I could find.</p>

<h2 id="cheap-apple-computer-memory"><strong>Cheap Apple Computer Memory</strong></h2>

<p>I started ramseeker tracking ram prices for just Apple computers so if there’s one thing I know, it’s where to get computer memory for Apple computers cheaply. In 2012, almost all current Apple computers take the same amount of RAM. Mac Mini, MacBook Pro and Apple iMac all use  DDR3 1600Mhz  SDRAM sodimms. Here are the lowest prices on Apple Memory I could find:</p>

<p>[table id=15 /]</p>

<h2 id="cheap-hp-computer-memory"><strong>Cheap HP Computer Memory</strong></h2>

<p>Memory for HP notebooks are another type of memory you can get cheaply now and like the Apple products, most HP notebooks like the HP Envy will allow up to 16GB of RAM installed and not only is HP memory cheap, but  it will allow you to work much faster regardless of whether you use your HP notebook for fun or business.</p>

<p>[table id=15 /]</p>

<h2 id="cheap-dell-computer-memory">Cheap Dell Computer Memory</h2>

<p>Dell Inspirons, XPS or Latitude models all take more ram and like the HP and Apple’s above you can get ram much much cheaper when you buy the memory anywhere but from Dell which tends to overcharge for their memory upgrades. You’re much better off buying ram from one of the memory stores below. When you do, not only will you save money on RAM, your dell will run faster and allow you to open more applications at the same time. Most Dell notebooks this year can accept up to 16GB of RAM. Check your manual .</p>

<p>[table id=15 /]</p>

<p> </p>

<h2 id="cheap-sony-computer-memory">Cheap Sony Computer Memory</h2>

<p>Sony computers are usually not known for being the cheapest computer you can buy, unless you get a deal on a Sony notebook  most  Sony VAIO models tend to be expensive than their DEll or HP counterparts.  But just because the Sony notebook is pricey doesn’t mean you can’t  get ram for Sony notebook computers cheaply. Most Sony’s can accept  up  to 16GB of RAM and installing ram in a Sony notebook is easy and cheap when you buy ram for Sony Notebooks from these stores:</p>

<p>[table id=15 /]</p>

<h2 id="where-to-buy-cheap-computer-memory-upgrades">Where To Buy Cheap Computer Memory Upgrades</h2>

<p>In addition to the memory stores in the pricing tables above,  I like buying cheap memory from Amazon as a lot of times they tend to have better prices on RAM than any other memory store and offer not only the cheapest computer memory prices but outstanding return policies too. Here are some suggestions for cheap computer memory:</p>

    <h1><a href="/2012/11/where-to-buy-imac-ram/">Where To Buy iMac RAM</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>The iMacs in 2012 are becoming one of the most popular Apple desktops to be released this year for a few reasons: First, the design is even slimmer for the new Apple iMacs vs the 2011 Apple iMacs, and secondly you can upgrade some of the higher end iMac models all the way to 32GB, which is double the ram capacity for older iMacs from laster year. The ram upgrade chart for the current iMacs look like this:<img class="size-full wp-image-6672 alignnone" title="where to buy iMac RAM" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Screen-Shot-2012-11-05-at-3.10.27-PM.png" alt="" width="837" height="744" /></p>

<h3 id="ghz-apple-imac-215-inch-screen">2.7GHz Apple iMac 21.5 inch Screen</h3>

<p>This iMac ships from the factory with just 8GB of ram installed (4GBX2), but you can max out the ram on this iMac model and I suggest you do because iMac ram is so cheap this year.</p>

<h3 id="ghz-apple-imac-215-inch-screen-1">2.9GHz Apple iMac 21.5 inch Screen</h3>

<p>This iMac is the same specifications when it comes to memory – you still start with 8GB of iMac ram from Apple, but you can max out the ram on this iMac to 16GB</p>

<h3 id="ghz-apple-imac-27-inch-screen">2.9GHz Apple iMac 27 inch Screen</h3>

<p>If you cough up big money for the 27 inches of screen real estate, you not only get a bigger display, you also get more memory capacity – but if you add 8GB of ram x 4 you can max out the memory on the new Apple iMacs all the way to 32GB of RAM – one of the first Apple iMacs able to accept 32GB of RAM</p>

<h3 id="ghz-apple-imac-27-inch-screen-1">3.2GHz Apple iMac 27 inch Screen</h3>

<p>The fastest Apple iMac also requires the same ram as the other 27 inch Apple computer and will also accept 32GB of ram in the four memory upgrade slots the Apple iMac has.</p>

<h2 id="where-to-buy-imac-ram">Where To Buy iMac RAM</h2>

<p>All of the Apple iMac models above require the newest in Apple memory technology  – and that’s DDR3 1600Mhz sodimms.  The sodimms are considered notebook ram but the iMac, despite the desktop form factor does require the smaller sodimm for notebook compters vs the SDRAM DIMM designed for desktops computers.</p>

<p>The prices for iMac RAM continue to drop over the years and in fact the memory for iMacs have been the best deal I have ever seen on Apple iMac memory. Below are the best prices on iMac RAM and the memory stores where you can buy iMac RAM.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2012/11/what-ram-do-i-need-for-apple-imac/">What RAM Do I Need for Apple iMac?</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>One of the best ways to find out exactly what ram you need for your iMac is to use a memory configurator to get the best ram prices for iMac that you know will work. You also don’t have to guess with charts and tables either. All you have to do is choose your brand (Apple, obviously) what Apple iMac you have (2010, 2012, processor speed, screen size ) and the memory configurator will then tell you exactly what RAM you need to buy for your Apple iMac.</p>

<p><strong>2012 Apple iMac RAM Types </strong></p>

<p>The 2012 iMacs were just released in late October 2012 and now join the MacBook Pro models and the Mac Mini as using the much faster DDR3 1600Mhz sodimms. This is the fastest iMac RAM you can buy today.</p>

<p><strong>Where to Buy RAM for 2012 Apple iMac </strong></p>

<p>You can buy ram for iMac from pretty much any store that will sell and stock ddr3 1600mhz sodimms, but I suggest you buy RAM from the following memory stores for memory for the new Apple iMacs. One thing to note is that the 27 inch Apple iMacs can now accept 32GB of ram so you will need to buy 8GB memory modules x4. For the smaller screen iMacs, you are limited to a maximum of  16Gb and you can buy a 16GB memory upgrade kit or two 8GB iMac RAM kits or 4x4GB ddr3 1600 Mhz sodimms to get you to the maximum of 16GB allowed.</p>

<p>[table id=15 /]</p>

<p><strong>2011 Apple IMac RAM Types </strong></p>

<p>The now discontinued Apple iMacs (<a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-1548159-10847025"><strong><em>check here for some great deals</em></strong></a>) take the slower 1333mhz spec’d ddr3 sodimms so be sure to buy the right memory for the 2011 iMacs vs the 2012 iMacs that use faster memory. Like the smaller 2012 iMac models, all 2011 Apple iMacs can only accept up  to 16GB of RAM maximum. If  you want to install more than 16GB of RAM in a 2011 or older iMac – you can’t and will need to buy a 27 inch Apple iMac.</p>

<p>[table id=7 /]</p>

<p>For older iMac models,I recommend you check either <a href="http://www.lowendmac.com">lowendmac</a> or <a href="http://www.everymac.com">everymac</a> for ram specifications for the older Mac models as I tend to concentrating on getting you the best deals on iMac memory for new iMacs vs older iMacs.</p>

<p>Buy a Brand New 2012 iMac.</p>

<p>If you’re ready to buy a 2012 iMac I suggest you check <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;field-keywords=iMac&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;url=search-alias%3Daps"><strong>Amazon</strong></a> or <a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-1548159-10847025"><strong>MacMall</strong></a> for the best deals on a 2012 Apple iMac.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2012/11/what-is-the-best-value-usb-dac-for-2012/">What is the Best Value USB DAC for 2012?</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p><img class="alignnone" title="best usb dac for 2012" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/JIM_5414.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" /></p>

<p>One way to get better sound out of your computer or iPod  is to use an external DAC. A DAC, (digital audio converter) does what the description says it does: It translates digital audio to analog sound that is then amplified to your headphones (or loudspeakers) . In all but a few cases, the DAC inside your computer is not the best way to convert the digital signal from your audio files, regardless of whether they are in FLAC format, MP3 or Apple Lossless format the DAC inside your notebook or desktop computer is not going to be the best quality.</p>

<p>If you can now easily buy a brand new laptop for under $400, it only makes sense that the DAC isn’t going to be the best of quality. Then you also have to consider the noise inside the notebook computer from spinning hard drives (this is not really an issue with solid state drives thanks to the lack of moving parts on solid state drives), and all these factors add up to the fact that you’re not going get the best sound out of the headphone jack on your iPOd or notebook computer.</p>

<p>The solution to this is buy an external DAC for your notebook. You can spend silly money on a DAC  if you want, but one of the best DACs I have found (and am listening to right now as I write this) is the Fiio E7 portable headphone DAC. (<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/fiio-e7-portable-dac-and-headphone-amplifier-review/" title="Fiio E7 Portable DAC and Headphone Amplifier Review">see my review here</a>). This small DAC is about the size of a small deck of cards and yet features a much better quality chip inside of the small and battery powered DAC.</p>

<p>Using the Fiio E7 with an iPod is easy (buy the iPod adapter cable) and then connect the Fiio E7 to the connector on the bottom of your iPod and then plug your headphones into the DAC</p>

<p>If you want to connect the DAC to your computer, all you need is a USB cable that comes with the Fiio E7 and connect the DAC to the USB output (you’re going to have to configure your computer to output through the USB port) and then connect your headphones.</p>

<p>For the money,  (well under $100) this has to be one of the  best values in a small and portable DAC that is very flexible and can be used as a portable self powered DAC for your iPod,  a notebook computer DAC or if you buy an external amplifier, can also be used as a DAC for your desktop computer to. You really can’t find a more versatile DAC for listening to your digital files and getting much better sound quality in 2012.</p>
