<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004YLCLM6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B004YLCLM6">Best Price on Apple Mac Mini Intel Core i5 2.3Ghz (Mid 2011) </a></strong></p>

<p>The Apple Mac Mini with an Intel Core i5 2.3GHz processor is the <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;redirect=true&amp;ref_=sr_nr_n_0&amp;keywords=apple%20computer&amp;bbn=493964&amp;qid=1314967620&amp;rnid=493964&amp;rh=n%3A172282%2Ck%3Aapple%20computer%2Cn%3A%21493964%2Cn%3A541966#?_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">cheapest Apple computer you can buy</a></strong> and makes a great choice for a student computer or home theater or music server, just two applications the Apple Mac Mini could be used for.</p>

<p>One reason the <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004YLCLM6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B004YLCLM6">Mac Mini is so cheap</a></strong>, is that this is the only Apple computer that doesn’t come shipped with a keyboard, mouse or monitor. If you need these, you may be better off <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;x=0&amp;ref_=nb_sb_noss&amp;y=0&amp;field-keywords=imac&amp;url=search-alias%3Daps#?_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">buying an Apple iMac</a></strong> instead as the savings on this cheap desktop from Apple will be much less when you factor in the cost of Apple peripherals.</p>

<p>The Apple Mac Mini ships standard from Apple with just 2GB of memory installed in it from Apple (one reason the Mac Mini is so cheap) but using the two available memory slots in the Apple Mac Mini you can install up to 8GB of RAM by adding a <strong>8GB Mac Mini Memory Upgrade Kit</strong> that is priced currently at about $50* you could see an additional 50% or more of a performance upgrade by upgrading the 2011 Apple Mac Mini to the full 8GB of RAM it can recognize.</p>

<p><strong>Where To Buy Mac Mini 2.3 GHz RAM.<br />
**<br />
One store that sells name brand memory for Mac Mini as well as other computer brands is <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial" title="crucial mac mini memory">Crucial Technology</a>, but as I write this the cheapest Mac Mini RAM for the Intel Core i5 2011 version is Corsair memory available **<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002YUF8ZG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=B002YUF8ZG" title="Mac Mini RAM on Sale">on sale at Amazon</a></strong> and beats the Crucial memory price by a fair margin.</p>

<p>With ram prices so cheap for Apple Mac Mini Intel Core i5 2.3 GHz, I fully recommend you go straight to the 8GB maximum memory by filling the two available RAM slots the Mac Mini offers. If you’re really on a tight budget you could buy a 4GB Mac Mini RAM kit instead that still doubles your RAM, but with 8GB of RAM so cheap you’re best to go straight to 8GB of Mac Mini RAM.</p>

<p>**How To Install RAM in Apple Mac Mini Intel Core i5 2.3GHz<br />
**</p>

<p>Memory Installation on the Apple Mac Mini does not need to be done by a service professional (this wasn’t always the case) and if you follow the <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4432#1">Mac Mini RAM instructions</a> from Apple you will have no problems. The design on the new Mac Mini’s are brilliant as this is one of the only Apple computers you don’t need to use any tools with. The bottom cover on the underside of the Mac Mini twists off like you would a lid on a jar where the the entire RAM modules are easily accessible and with your fingers only you can remove and replace Apple Mac Mini Memory with ease.</p>

<p>*ram prices change for all computers and recently have been dropping.</p>

<p>The Acer Aspire 1825PT notebook is a 14 inch Acer notebook released in May 2010 and offers a P250 processor running at 2.3GHz with 3GB of RAM installed from the factory with a 320GB hard drive and runs windows 7 as the default operating system. With a sale price in the $500 area this notebook from Acer is a competitive notebook for the price and one of many notebooks available for sale if you’re in the market to buy a new Acer notebook.</p>

<p><strong>Acer Aspire 1825PT Memory Upgrades</strong></p>

<p>This is a relatively new Acer notebook that requires the use of DDR3 1066 SDRAM sodimms and this particular Acer notebook offers two memory upgrade slots and can be upgraded to 8GB by replacing the factory Acer RAM with two 4GB sdram sodimms. An <strong><a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT2KIT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1339">8GB Acer memory upgrade</a></strong> is the cheapest price I have seen in the fifteen years I have been monitoring ram prices and 8GB should cost you less than $50 for 8GB of Acer RAM. This is one of the better deals on RAM upgrades for Acer notebook computers today.</p>

<p>**How To Upgrade Acer Aspire 1825PT<br />
**</p>

<p>Like most Acer notebooks access to the ram upgrades are accessible via a small door or compartment on the bottom of the Acer Aspire 1825. Once you have the notebook batter removed, you can safely remove the door, revealing the ram upgrade slots on your Acer notebook.</p>

<p>Remove the Acer factory RAM upgrades by pulling back the two small tabs that hold the ram upgrades in place and gently pull on the memory module to remove the acer factory memory upgrade. Once both Acer Aspire 1825 memory upgrade slots are free, all you need to do is to reverse this process by adding 2x4GB DDR3 SDRAM sodimms to maximize both the Acer Aspire 1825 Memory and also Performance. You should find that after completing the ram upgrade your Acer notebook will run faster and smoother with the added 8GB of RAM.</p>

<p>The Apple iMac is Apple’s <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;x=0&amp;ref_=nb_sb_noss&amp;y=0&amp;field-keywords=apple%20imac&amp;url=search-alias%3Daps#?_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">Best Selling Apple Desktop</a></strong> and has been for years ever since introduced in the now very dated teal color scheme of the 1990’s with that little and revolutionary at the time, round Apple mouse with just the one button.</p>

<p>But in 2010, one of the best selling Apple iMac models had been the Apple iMac 3.06GHz model and with the fast dual core 3.06GHz Intel i3 processor that features a 256k level 2 cache, for each core and combines a 4GB system cache for both cores this is still a fast and entirely upgradeable Apple iMac despite the fact that it is now discontinued with faster iMacs released in 2011.</p>

<p>But just because you have an older 2010 Apple iMac means you need to upgrade the entire computer and you can increase the speed of your 21.5 inch iMac by <strong>buying and adding more memory</strong> instead.</p>

<p>This particular Apple iMac has a maximum memory allotment of 16GB of iMac Memory, even though Apple ships this iMac with just 4GB of RAM standard. You can quadruple the amount of RAM from 4GB to 16GB with this iMac by removing and replacing the factory installed 4GB configured as two two GB memory modules and replacing the Apple iMac RAM with much bigger 4GB memory modules x 4 to get the maximum benefit 16GB of RAM will provide in the 2010 Apple iMac 3.06GHz.</p>

<p><strong>What Memory Do I Buy for the Apple iMac 3.06GHz?</strong></p>

<p>This 2010 Apple iMac requires the <strong><a href="http://www.dpbolvw.net/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT51264BC1339">purchase of 4GB DDR3 SDRAM SODIMMs running at 1333Mhz</a></strong>. Unlike some iMacs in the past, this particular iMac part number requires that only DDR3 1333MHz RAM be installed and the chart below shows you the cheapest prices for iMac RAM for both the 2010 and 2011 Apple iMac Models:</p>

<p><strong>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000T8WN8U/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=B000T8WN8U">PNY OPTIMA 4GB (2x2GB) Dual Channel Kit DDR2 667 MHz PC2-5300 Notebook / Laptop SODIMM Memory Modules</a> are some of the cheapest ddr2 sodimms on sale today</strong></p>

<p>The <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">4GB DDR2 PC2-5300 memory upgrade kit</a></strong> is a little dated and pretty much any currently shipping and best selling notebook will only accept faster memory upgrades typically running at twice that speed or faster with speeds of 1066Mhz or even 1333Mhz, this is still a very popular memory upgrade to buy, especially if you have an older MacBook or MacBook Pro you need upgrading or want to squeeze a little life out of.</p>

<p>For under $50, this <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">cheap 4GB ddr2 pc5300 notebook memory upgrade</a></strong> is a bargain, especially when you compare what it may cost you to buy a new notebook. You should find that after installing this DDR2 laptop memory upgrade into your Mac or PC notebook that the laptop should run much faster and depending on the processor speed of your processor and other speed issues it’s not unthinkable to double your computer’s processing speed by adding a 4GB memory upgrade kit.</p>

<p>**RAM upgrades Are Cheap<br />
**</p>

<p>RAM Upgrades in 2011 are so cheap right now, I can’t stress enough if you have been on the fence about a ram upgrade, now is the time to buy. 4GB RAM upgrades kits, regardless of what notebook computer you want to install this memory upgrade into have never been cheaper. This memory module kit currently retails for under $50 and that’s half the price you would have paid for a ram upgrade just a few short months ago.</p>

<p>I don’t track ram prices for DDR2 memory any more as I tend to concentrate on the newer and more popular memory, but an example of RAM prices dropping would be that in April an 8GB DDR3 memory upgrade kit would have cost $93.00, and today the cheapest 8GB DDR3 RAM Price can be had for under $40, which should be affordable by anybody looking to upgrade their notebook RAM cheaply in 2011.</p>

<p>This is something I’ve been thinking about, as my current MacBook Pro is a 2.4GHz 2008 model, with a wonkey keyboard that needs to have the delete key fixed as it’s not dead yet but rather loose and to get it fixed looks like it may be more trouble than the MacBook is worth.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>I can still use the MacBook Pro for facebook and web surfing, but for getting some work done where my typing skills are probably the reason for the MacBook Pro’s early keyboard failure, there’s a <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/2011-apple-macbook-pros-announced/" title="2011 Apple MacBook Pros Announced">new MacBook Pro</a></strong> in my future as my current fix has been to just <strong>use the MacBook Pro as a desktop replacement</strong> and change my work habits some. This means I can’t compute from <a href="http://www.starbucks.com" title="best coffee ever">starbucks</a> but this also saves me from my coffee habit too so perhaps this is a good thing as having a broken keyboard on my MacBook Pro actually saves me money over time. Those $5 lattes add up.</p>

<p><strong>Buying a new MacBook Pro in August</strong></p>

<p>The argument for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8"><strong>buying a new MacBook Pro</strong> </a> now would be that I need to have a fast portable notebook from Apple that works and allows for all the portability features a fully functional MacBook Pro would  offer  – like a functional keyboard.  The fact that the new MacBook Pro would offer faster processors, more ram capacity and just overall a nicer computing experience than my current apple notebook should end the argument right then and there.</p>

<p>I can trade in my MacBook Pro or sell it on craiglist or eBay  to offset the cost of the new one.  Someone more patient or technically inclined may be able to fix my keyboard easily and I could use the money from my old MacBook Pro to help pay for the new 2011 MacBook Pro.</p>

<p>Assuming what I end up selling my old MacBook Pro for I may be able to realize a cheap MacBook Pro for about  half  price if I got lucky selling or trading my current notebook and using the funds realized from the sale towards the new Apple MacBook Pro with a fully functioning keyboard.</p>

<p><strong>Wait for the 2012 MacBook Pro</strong></p>

<p>If I can struggle along for a few more months, there’s a very good chance to see a new 2012 MacBook Pro in the new year and it’s my gues the 2012 MacBook Pro release date could be about the same time of the 2011 models were released, which is usually about January or February. These professional Mac notebooks usually see new releases happen in early winter. We only have about 4 months left once back to school starts and since  I’ve been OK with this notebook so far  I bet I can struggle along for the remainder of 2011 with this Mac notebook I already own.</p>

<p>It’s my guess the new 2012 MacBook Pros are going to see a redesign, and not just a speed bump or more RAM. I wouldn’t be surprised if at least one model(the 13 inch?)  is more like a <strong>MacBook Air Pro</strong> rather than just a MacBook Pro. The optical drive is pretty much dead to me now and  thanks to streaming  video and software downloads online I don’t really see much need for it any more.</p>

<p><strong>RAM and  solid state drive prices keep dropping</strong> so I bet by the new year we’ll see a MacBook Pro with a solid  state drive replacing the more traditional drives.  Like most things when <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/what-is-the-best-computer-brand-to-buy/" title="What is the Best Computer Brand to Buy?">buying a new computer</a>, the longer you wait when it comes to technology  the more you seem to get in features in speed for the same money.</p>

<p>Take the new MacBook Air models just released: They are the same cost as the 2010 models but now include much faster processors as well as backlit keyboards too. A nice feature I didn’t think I’d need until I stared to use it. It’s nice to see the keys on your keyboard (and have them work, too)</p>

<p><strong>Buy a 2011 MacBook Air instead</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005CWIN1E/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B005CWIN1E"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2617" title="Buying a MacBook Air " alt="is the macbook air the best deal on a mac notebook?" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screen-Shot-2011-07-28-at-1.30.36-PM.png" width="306" height="232" /></a></p>

<p>The argument  for buying a new MacBook Air instead is that I could <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref_%3Dsr_nr_p_4_0%26bbn%3D565108%26qid%3D1311873784%26rnid%3D15784691%26rh%3Dn%253A172282%252Cn%253A%2521493964%252Cn%253A541966%252Cn%253A565108%252Cp_4%253AApple%23&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957"><strong>buy a newly released Apple notebook now</strong>,</a> instead of waiting for  the 2012 MacBook Pros to be released. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005CWIN1E/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B005CWIN1E"><strong>MacBook Air</strong> </a> is a small, lightweight notebook from Apple with a much faster computer processor inside, a smoking fast solid state drive and the portability and weight I’ve never seen in an Apple notebook to date.</p>

<p>I might even be tempted to try the <strong>11 inch MacBook Air</strong> and then hook it up to an external display when I need more screen real estate than the small 11 incher offers. This may be the way I end up going because  as as much as my ego would like to think otherwise, I don’t need the ‘Pro’ in the MacBook Pro.  The MacBook Air’s battery life, light weight and faster solid state drive far outweighs slugging around a cd drive I don’t need or use rarely.</p>

<p>As cloud computing matures with the new <a href="http://icloud.com" title="apple icloud">iCloud</a> and other new similar services from Amazon and the like, I don’t think the need for big hard drives for my use  will be such a big deal and also: over time solid state drives will get bigger and cheaper, just like memory upgrades have. Who would have thought that when my current 2008 MacBook Pro was new that you would be able to buy <strong><a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT2KIT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1339">8GB of RAM for about $60</a></strong>? It was unthinkable at the time. ‘</p>

<p><strong>Buy a Mac Mini and  an iPad</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004YLCLM6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B004YLCLM6"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2618" title="How about  a Mac Mini?" alt="Mac Mini as my desktop computer" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screen-Shot-2011-07-28-at-1.32.41-PM.png" width="265" height="159" /></a>As tempting as the new <strong>MacBook Airs</strong> are, there’s still other options such as the <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0047DVWLW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B0047DVWLW">iPad</a></strong>  and the new <strong>2011 Mac Mini’s</strong> to consider too. This is another avenue I could go with as I already have all the <strong>Mac peripherals</strong> –  I could <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004YLCLM6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B004YLCLM6">buy the cheaper Mac Mini</a></strong> for desktop computing use  and <strong>buy the iPad 2</strong> for the portable stuff  like email, web browsing and all those funky apps for sale at the <a href="http://www.apple.com" title="apple app store">App store</a>. The cost for a new Mac Mini and iPad would be pretty close to the price of a new MacBook Air or 13 inch MacBook Pro. One reason I haven’t jumped on the iPad bandwagon as of yet is the fact that  I wonder if I would be able to live with the iPad as a notebook replacement?</p>

<p>I know I can buy iPad accessories and keyboards, but then you may as well buy a MacBook Air that offers a full sized keyboard. The iPad scares me as I need to touch type and the lack of a tactile feel of a real keyboard is an important thing to me. I’ve spent some time with the iPad and it’s fine for sending off 100 words or less in an email but I wonder if I could actually type with one as my one  and only portable computing device?</p>

<p><strong>Which Mac Do I Buy?</strong></p>

<p>Here’s the thing: I don’t need to buy a new Mac today, as much as I’d like to think I do.</p>

<p>I think the answer to this question is to ask yourself: Do you need a new computer today?  Not want – <strong>need</strong>. It’s easy to get sucked in to the Apple marketing machine and make no mistake I’m their biggest fan (or sucker) , but <strong>if you don’t need a new Mac  don’t buy one</strong>.</p>

<p>Use the Mac (or PC even) you already own and spend a fraction on <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="apple upgrades">new upgrades</a> for your <a href="http://www.lowendmac.com" title="lowendmac.com">old Mac</a>, as opposed to replacing it. I have lost thousands of dollars spending money on  Apple computers I didn’t really need. I wanted them, sure. But needed, no. If you can swing it the best thing to do is to upgrade the RAM to the maximum on your Apple computer.</p>

<p>You may find that with a RAM upgrade, you don’t even need to buy a new Apple computer and  I just saved you $1000 or more as  <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="best apple memory upgrades">a memory upgrade for the Mac you already own is the best Apple deal you can buy</a></strong>. And now with the fact that <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/best-ssd-hard-drives-for-2011/" title="Best SSD Hard Drives for 2011"><strong>solid state hard drives are getting cheaper and cheaper</strong> </a>with some starting at under $100 today, it’s quite possible for  under $200 to greatly improve the performance of the computer you already own and have paid for. This is the **best Apple deal you can find today **and is much cheaper than buying a new 2011 computer from Apple.</p>

<p><strong>An 8GB RAM Upgrade does not cost much at all. </strong></p>

<p><strong> </strong>In fact, RAM for the Apple MacBook Pros released in February 2011 has never been cheaper, and if you’re looking to upgrade an older MacBook Pro from 2009 or 2010 – even though the 2011 and 2010 MacBook Pros use different RAM (1333MHz sodimms vs 1066Mhz sodimms) the prices for an upgrade to the MacBook Pro’s maximum could cost you less than $50 if you trade in your old 4GB RAM.</p>

<p><strong>Let’s have a look, shall we?</strong></p>

<p>For a 2011 MacBook Pro, regardless of screen size or cost the ram required is a<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/8GB">n <strong>8GB DDR3 SDRAM sodimm memory upgrade kit</strong>,</a> where most memory stores will happily sell you, (see ram price chart for MacBook Pros below)  but the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/cheapest-ram-upgrades-for-apple-computers-july-25-2011/" title="Cheapest RAM Upgrades for Apple Computers. July 25, 2011">cheapest MacBook Pro RAM</a> currently sits at about $<strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002YUF8ZG/ref=as_li_ss_til?tag=ramseeker-20&amp;camp=213381&amp;creative=390973&amp;linkCode=as4&amp;creativeASIN=B002YUF8ZG&amp;adid=1M72YM31597Z6H77GVMK&amp;">55 for  an 8GB upgrade</a></strong>, quite the price drop from the $90 or so the market demanded for MacBook Pro RAM just a few  months prior to today.</p>

<p>But to max out the memory on your MacBook Pro, you’ll need to replace the 2x2GB memory upgrade modules that shipped standard with your Apple notebook and replace them with 2x4GB memory modules.</p>

<p>This leaves you with an extra 4GB of MacBook Pro RAM, you’re not really sure what to do with, but you have a few options to make the upgrade from 4GB to 8GB even cheaper:</p>

<p><strong>Sell your memory online</strong><br />
<a href="http://www.craigslist.org"> craigslist </a>and <a href="http://www.ebay.com">ebay </a>are great sites to make money from your old RAM, effectively reducing the total cost of your 8GB MacBook Pro RAM upgrade</p>

<p><strong>Trade in your memory </strong><br />
There’s more  than one memory store that will apply your old MacBook Pro RAM  to  the total cost of your 8GB upgrade</p>

<p><strong>Donate your memory</strong> there’s lots of  organizations that will take your memory  donation  where they can sell it and use the proceeds from your old memory to support their cause.  <a href="http://www.salvationarmyusa.org/usn/www_usn_2.nsf">Salvation Army</a> and <a href="http://www.salvationarmyusa.org/usn/www_usn_2.nsf">Goodwill </a>will take memory upgrade donations, or perhaps there’s a school or other way  to help others with your factory, but still perfectly usable 4GB memory upgrade.</p>

<p>To summarize, if you buy RAM for MacBook Pro that’s not only the cheapest it’s ever been (now is the best time to buy Apple Memory) but sell or donate the MacBook Pro’s factory installed memory you should be able to realize a total cost of under $50 for an 8GB MacBook Pro Memory Upgrade</p>

<p> </p>

<p>This 4GB RAM module is compatible with pretty much every Apple computer current in 2011:</p>

<p>MacBook Pro notebook computers requires the use of two of these memory upgrade modules to max out your memory in 2011, and with the iMac, and for all but the cheapest iMac – you’ll need to buy two of these memory modules to add another 8GB of iMac RAM, and with the release of the new Apple Mac Minis, this is another Apple computer that can  use the maximum of 8GB by <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002YU83YO/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=B002YU83YO">buying two of these corsair 4GB RAM modules</a></strong>.</p>

<p>Of course,  there’s numerous notebook manufacturers that recommend the use of ddr3 sodimms for ram upgrades and most notebooks can take 8GB easy so make your windows machine run faster with the maximum ram possible as it’s so so cheap now.</p>

<p>If either saving money on RAM or the corsair brand doesn’t work for you there’s other solutions when it comes to buying 4GB DDR3 notebook memory on sale.</p>

<p>Apple has had some pretty big news this week. New <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26x%3D0%26ref_%3Dnb_sb_noss%26y%3D0%26field-keywords%3Dmacbook%2520air%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps%23&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">MacBook Airs</a>, New Mac OS in the form of Mac OSX Lion, and finally the cheapest Mac you can buy today in the form of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26x%3D0%26ref_%3Dnb_sb_noss%26y%3D0%26field-keywords%3Dmac%2520mini%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps%23&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">Apple Mac Mini</a> computer:</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004YLCLM6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B004YLCLM6">The 2011 Apple Mac Mini is the Cheapest Apple Computer You Can Buy</a></strong></p>

<p>One of the first things I tend to ask when any new model of <a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple computer</a> is introduced is <strong>what kind of RAM does the Mac Mini require</strong>? And, as I had guessed with the speed bump in a processor to Intel Core i5 processors also comes a speed bump in ram speed as well and with the release of this small and cheap computer from Apple the ram speed required is increased from <strong>1066Mhz sodimms to 1333Mhz sodimms</strong>. The maximum RAM on the Mac Minis is 8GB by installing <strong><a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT2KIT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1339">two 4GB DDR3 1333MHz sodimms</a>,</strong> as per Apple although you can buy 16GB Mac Mini RAM it’s not something I suggest at this time mostly due to price: <strong>You could have an entire lineup of Mac Minis for what a 16GB Mac Mini memory upgrade kit will cost you today.</strong></p>

<p>[table id=13 /]</p>

<p>The only currently shipping Mac that requires different memory is the Apple Mac Pro as it uses DDR3 SDRAM DIMMS as opposed to DDR3 SDRAM sodimms usually designed for notebook compouters. If you have more than one current 2011 Apple computer at your home or place of work, it’s quite possible for you to swap out the RAM from both or either the Apple iMac or MacBook Pro because with the release of the Mac Mini, <strong>three out of four Macs all use the exact same memory</strong>.</p>

<p>When the Mac Minis were <a href="http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/mac_mini/index-macmini.html" title="first mac minis">first introduced</a> you really were not supposed to upgrade the RAM on this small desktop as the RAM was hard to get to and would or could void your warranty.</p>

<p>But with the release of the 2011 Apple Mac Mini, that’s all changed (the 2010 Apple Mac Minis were the same too) and ease of memory installation on these cheap desktops is now encouraged and even promoted as a selling feature on the <a href="http://www.apple.com/macmini/" title="apple mac mini">Mac Mini</a> page at Apple. How times have changed.</p>

<p>**A word about Mac Mini RAM Upgrades<br />
**</p>

<p>If you buy memory from Apple for your Apple Mac Mini, you will very likely have no problems with your Mac Mini RAM, not to mention the fact that this makes buying a Mac Mini even easier as you can buy both the memory and computer from the same online store. (not to mention the keyboard, mouse and display too).</p>

<p>What Apple doesn’t tell you is that compared to other name brand memory manufacturers the ram the sell for all Apple products is very expensive. You could argue that of course generic RAM for Mac Mini is going to be the cheaper RAM, but this applies to the brand name memory too. In fact, if you want the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com">cheapest RAM for Mac Mini</a>, regardless of brand I have found it to be from Corsair which is a reputable brand name for Mac Mini RAM. If you have another $300 to spend buy the Apple RAM but if you want to save money on RAM for the Mac Mini you have better choices that will cost you considerably less.</p>

<p>**2.3GHz Apple Mac Mini<br />
**</p>

<p>This is the Mac Mini I’m going to buy in the near future. If you’re like me you already have picked up an external monitor and have an extra keyboard or mouse kicking around so paying extra for all the, um, extras might not make a whole lot of sense and this Mac Mini will do just fine for a lot of us looking to use the Mac Mini as a file server, or even replacement for a new desktop computer.</p>

<p>**Newer Faster Processors<br />
** This is a long time coming this new Mac Mini refresh and even though the 2010 Mac Mini was fast, the second generation Intel i5 and i7 processors change the game and now these small desktops offer the same computing power as some other desktop computers costing more and not offering the advantages of the Apple operating system including the newly released OSX Lion – Apple’s latest and newest operating system that’s included free of charge when you buy the 2.3GHz Mac Mini.</p>

<p>**Connect with Thunderbolt Technology and more<br />
**</p>

<p>I saw this coming. First available with the Apple MacBook Pros it makes complete sense for Apple to include this new technology in the Mac Minis, but for some reason I can’t see or get excited about the thunderbolt port. But I’m not connecting a whole whack of peripherals at one time, and I think for most of us who want to just buy the cheapest Mac they can, this feature could be lost. What’s more important when it comes to ports on the back of the Mac Mini is the 4 USB ports and HDMI port that offers a one cable solution for connecting the Mac Mini to your HDTV. The option of being able to connect two displays to the Mac Mini at the same time makes for a nice touch though and the fact that you can use whatever peripheral you’ve got kicking around and use it with these new Macs offers more value than the thunderbolt stuff at this time.</p>

<p>**More, for less.<br />
**</p>

<p>I could be wrong, but if I recall the MSRP on the 2010 Mac Mini was higher at about $699 so the new Mac Mini’s don’t just offer more speed they also offer a cheaper overall price. The 2.3GHz Mac Mini is the best price you can get on a new Mac today and unless you need portability or need to buy all the apple peripherals, where the savings when you add the 2.3 GHz to the cost of the keyboard, display and mouse might mean a better deal would be to buy the cheap iMac instead as the iMac ships with all the peripherals included right out of the box.</p>

<p>**Faster Graphics.<br />
**<br />
This is important if you’re gaming, editing movies or simply for video playback at home you want to be sure that your graphics card is up to the task when called upon and the fastest computer won’t do you any good if there’s a bottleneck when it comes time to display. According to Apple this won’t be the case thanks to the much faster graphics card on the 2.3GHz Mac Mini as the AMD Radeon HD graphics processor with 256MB of GDDR5 memory packs more punch than ever before with some applications offering twice as fast graphics than the 2010 Mac Mini this computer replaces.</p>

<p>Bluetooth and Wifi are pretty standard fare in 2011 so I don’t think I need to spend too much time with these topics and suffice it to say that the 2011 Mac Mini offers both these technologies</p>

<p>**2.5 GHz Apple Mac Mini<br />
**</p>

<p>Apple offers an even faster Mac Mini for $799, and save for the extra $200 and faster processor: Intel Core i5 2.3GHz vs Intel Core i5 2.5Ghz, more memory (2GB vs 4GB) and a faster video card as the main differences between the two Mac Mini models, there’s not much else to write about the more expensive Mac Mini and if it were my money, I’d save it and buy more RAM and save the difference for your next Mac Mini or future Mac from Apple.</p>

<p><strong>Save Money on the 2011 Apple  Mac Mini</strong></p>

<p>It’s not much, but  if you <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26x%3D0%26ref_%3Dnb_sb_noss%26y%3D0%26field-keywords%3Dmac%2520mini%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps%23&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">buy a Mac Mini at Amazon</a></strong>  you can save over the full MSRP  of  what Apple charges with current savings on new Mac Minis only being $5 or so as these are new machines from Apple, it’s still a savings and worth a mention.</p>

<p>Also, check out MacMall for <strong><a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-1548159-10847025">Mac Mini Bargains</a></strong>, especially if you can live with a 2010 Mac Mini as now is the time to buy a discontinued Mac Mini for even more savings as the discontinued models get liquidated to make room for the faster 2011 Mac Mini models.</p>

<p>It will not cost much at all to <strong><a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT2KIT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1339">buy more ram for your HP notebook</a></strong> at the best price I could find.</p>

<p>In fact, if  you consider that your HP notebook already ships with some  memory that you can sell or  trade your HP notebook upgrade, regardless of model number will cost you less than you think.  Most HP notebook computers manufactured in 2011 are capable of accepting and recognizing 8GB of RAM so why not spend the $50 or so to max out your HP notebook to the maximum performance potential?</p>

<p>One of the <strong>best selling HP notebooks</strong> you can buy today is the HP ProBook 4525 (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0046UY3X0/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=B0046UY3X0">currently on sale at Amazon for under $500</a>) and this notebook allows up to 8GB of RAM, yet only comes shipped with 2GB. Yet, if you replace the stock HP memory for RAM that will allow this ProBook notebook to run faster and  allow you to be more efficient you can get more work done, and the HP ProBook RAM Upgrade is pretty cheap for this notebook too. You’ll need to buy <strong><a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-1548159-10273954?url=http://www.crucial.com/store/affiliateredirect.asp?imodule=CT2KIT51264BC1067&amp;aid=1027395&amp;cid=777292&amp;subid=89&amp;PRS&amp;uscj&amp;cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1067">2x4GB DDR3 1066Mhz sdram sodimms</a> </strong> for this HP notebook, and as there’s only two memory upgrade slots in this HP notebook you’ll need to remove the RAM  installed in the HP ProBook 4525 and replace it with the bigger memory upgrade modules for HP notebooks.</p>

<p>Another <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051OLPT0/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B0051OLPT0">great deal on a HP notebook</a></strong> right now, and  another example of how adding more RAM is the best HP notebook upgrade you can do is with the <strong>HP Pavilion DM4-2070 notebook</strong>. This a faster and more expensive notebook than the probook above (still a great deal on a HP computer though)  and offers <strong>faster 2nd generation processors</strong> than what’s in the HP ProBook. But the same applies to the HP DM4-2070 too, and even though its’ a faster HP computer to begin with, when you add more memory you get a faster computer. This HP notebook computer uses RAM that’s different than the memory above and this time you need to buy <strong><a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT2KIT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1339">8GB DDR3 SDRAM SODIMM</a></strong> notebook computer memory kits running at 1333Mhz. The maximum RAM  for the  DM4-2070 is still the maximum of 8GB (not too many notebooks offer 16GB of RAM, yet) and again you can replace the factory RAM from HP with cheaper and faster HP memory to take this HP notebook model all the way to 8GB.</p>

<p>The HP ProBook 4530 is probably the best value  today among the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fbestsellers%2Felectronics%2F565108%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref_%3Dzg_bs_nav%23&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">best selling  notebook computers</a> as you combine the faster notebook processors running  Intel Core i3 processors and use the faster 1333Mhz DDR3 ram technology than the ProBook above. Although I’ve yet to test either HP notebook,  I can be pretty sure just due to the <strong>memory requirements of the HP Probook 4525</strong> that it will be the slower notebook when you compare the two computer notebooks from HP side by side.</p>

<p>These are just three of the current <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26redirect%3Dtrue%26ref_%3Dsr_nr_n_1%26keywords%3Dhp%2520notebook%2520laptop%26bbn%3D541966%26qid%3D1311097069%26rnid%3D541966%26rh%3Dn%253A172282%252Ck%253Ahp%2520notebook%2520laptop%252Cn%253A%2521493964%252Cn%253A541966%252Cn%253A565108%23&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">best selling HP notebooks</a> and despite what may be differences in processor,  price and screen size and even memory requirements, there’s a theme here and  that is that every HP notebook we looked at today can take <strong>8GB of RAM</strong>  and that this is a big  improvement in computer speed, especially when you jump from 2GB of RAM to <strong><a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT2KIT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1339">8GB of notebook RAM for HP notebook computers</a></strong>.</p>
