<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p> </p>

<p><strong>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000T8WN8U/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=B000T8WN8U">PNY OPTIMA 4GB (2x2GB) Dual Channel Kit DDR2 667 MHz PC2-5300 Notebook / Laptop SODIMM Memory Modules</a> are some of the cheapest ddr2 sodimms on sale today</strong></p>

<p>The <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">4GB DDR2 PC2-5300 memory upgrade kit</a></strong> is a little dated and pretty much any currently shipping and best selling notebook will only accept faster memory upgrades typically running at twice that speed or faster with speeds of 1066Mhz or even 1333Mhz, this is still a very popular memory upgrade to buy, especially if you have an older MacBook or MacBook Pro you need upgrading or want to squeeze a little life out of.</p>

<p>For under $50, this <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">cheap 4GB ddr2 pc5300 notebook memory upgrade</a></strong> is a bargain, especially when you compare what it may cost you to buy a new notebook. You should find that after installing this DDR2 laptop memory upgrade into your Mac or PC notebook that the laptop should run much faster and depending on the processor speed of your processor and other speed issues it’s not unthinkable to double your computer’s processing speed by adding a 4GB memory upgrade kit.</p>

<p>**RAM upgrades Are Cheap<br />
**</p>

<p>RAM Upgrades in 2011 are so cheap right now, I can’t stress enough if you have been on the fence about a ram upgrade, now is the time to buy. 4GB RAM upgrades kits, regardless of what notebook computer you want to install this memory upgrade into have never been cheaper. This memory module kit currently retails for under $50 and that’s half the price you would have paid for a ram upgrade just a few short months ago.</p>

<p>I don’t track ram prices for DDR2 memory any more as I tend to concentrate on the newer and more popular memory, but an example of RAM prices dropping would be that in April an 8GB DDR3 memory upgrade kit would have cost $93.00, and today the cheapest 8GB DDR3 RAM Price can be had for under $40, which should be affordable by anybody looking to upgrade their notebook RAM cheaply in 2011.</p>

<p>This is something I’ve been thinking about, as my current MacBook Pro is a 2.4GHz 2008 model, with a wonkey keyboard that needs to have the delete key fixed as it’s not dead yet but rather loose and to get it fixed looks like it may be more trouble than the MacBook is worth.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>I can still use the MacBook Pro for facebook and web surfing, but for getting some work done where my typing skills are probably the reason for the MacBook Pro’s early keyboard failure, there’s a <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/2011-apple-macbook-pros-announced/" title="2011 Apple MacBook Pros Announced">new MacBook Pro</a></strong> in my future as my current fix has been to just <strong>use the MacBook Pro as a desktop replacement</strong> and change my work habits some. This means I can’t compute from <a href="http://www.starbucks.com" title="best coffee ever">starbucks</a> but this also saves me from my coffee habit too so perhaps this is a good thing as having a broken keyboard on my MacBook Pro actually saves me money over time. Those $5 lattes add up.</p>

<p><strong>Buying a new MacBook Pro in August</strong></p>

<p>The argument for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8"><strong>buying a new MacBook Pro</strong> </a> now would be that I need to have a fast portable notebook from Apple that works and allows for all the portability features a fully functional MacBook Pro would  offer  – like a functional keyboard.  The fact that the new MacBook Pro would offer faster processors, more ram capacity and just overall a nicer computing experience than my current apple notebook should end the argument right then and there.</p>

<p>I can trade in my MacBook Pro or sell it on craiglist or eBay  to offset the cost of the new one.  Someone more patient or technically inclined may be able to fix my keyboard easily and I could use the money from my old MacBook Pro to help pay for the new 2011 MacBook Pro.</p>

<p>Assuming what I end up selling my old MacBook Pro for I may be able to realize a cheap MacBook Pro for about  half  price if I got lucky selling or trading my current notebook and using the funds realized from the sale towards the new Apple MacBook Pro with a fully functioning keyboard.</p>

<p><strong>Wait for the 2012 MacBook Pro</strong></p>

<p>If I can struggle along for a few more months, there’s a very good chance to see a new 2012 MacBook Pro in the new year and it’s my gues the 2012 MacBook Pro release date could be about the same time of the 2011 models were released, which is usually about January or February. These professional Mac notebooks usually see new releases happen in early winter. We only have about 4 months left once back to school starts and since  I’ve been OK with this notebook so far  I bet I can struggle along for the remainder of 2011 with this Mac notebook I already own.</p>

<p>It’s my guess the new 2012 MacBook Pros are going to see a redesign, and not just a speed bump or more RAM. I wouldn’t be surprised if at least one model(the 13 inch?)  is more like a <strong>MacBook Air Pro</strong> rather than just a MacBook Pro. The optical drive is pretty much dead to me now and  thanks to streaming  video and software downloads online I don’t really see much need for it any more.</p>

<p><strong>RAM and  solid state drive prices keep dropping</strong> so I bet by the new year we’ll see a MacBook Pro with a solid  state drive replacing the more traditional drives.  Like most things when <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/what-is-the-best-computer-brand-to-buy/" title="What is the Best Computer Brand to Buy?">buying a new computer</a>, the longer you wait when it comes to technology  the more you seem to get in features in speed for the same money.</p>

<p>Take the new MacBook Air models just released: They are the same cost as the 2010 models but now include much faster processors as well as backlit keyboards too. A nice feature I didn’t think I’d need until I stared to use it. It’s nice to see the keys on your keyboard (and have them work, too)</p>

<p><strong>Buy a 2011 MacBook Air instead</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005CWIN1E/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B005CWIN1E"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2617" title="Buying a MacBook Air " alt="is the macbook air the best deal on a mac notebook?" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screen-Shot-2011-07-28-at-1.30.36-PM.png" width="306" height="232" /></a></p>

<p>The argument  for buying a new MacBook Air instead is that I could <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref_%3Dsr_nr_p_4_0%26bbn%3D565108%26qid%3D1311873784%26rnid%3D15784691%26rh%3Dn%253A172282%252Cn%253A%2521493964%252Cn%253A541966%252Cn%253A565108%252Cp_4%253AApple%23&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957"><strong>buy a newly released Apple notebook now</strong>,</a> instead of waiting for  the 2012 MacBook Pros to be released. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005CWIN1E/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B005CWIN1E"><strong>MacBook Air</strong> </a> is a small, lightweight notebook from Apple with a much faster computer processor inside, a smoking fast solid state drive and the portability and weight I’ve never seen in an Apple notebook to date.</p>

<p>I might even be tempted to try the <strong>11 inch MacBook Air</strong> and then hook it up to an external display when I need more screen real estate than the small 11 incher offers. This may be the way I end up going because  as as much as my ego would like to think otherwise, I don’t need the ‘Pro’ in the MacBook Pro.  The MacBook Air’s battery life, light weight and faster solid state drive far outweighs slugging around a cd drive I don’t need or use rarely.</p>

<p>As cloud computing matures with the new <a href="http://icloud.com" title="apple icloud">iCloud</a> and other new similar services from Amazon and the like, I don’t think the need for big hard drives for my use  will be such a big deal and also: over time solid state drives will get bigger and cheaper, just like memory upgrades have. Who would have thought that when my current 2008 MacBook Pro was new that you would be able to buy <strong><a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT2KIT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1339">8GB of RAM for about $60</a></strong>? It was unthinkable at the time. ‘</p>

<p><strong>Buy a Mac Mini and  an iPad</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004YLCLM6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B004YLCLM6"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2618" title="How about  a Mac Mini?" alt="Mac Mini as my desktop computer" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screen-Shot-2011-07-28-at-1.32.41-PM.png" width="265" height="159" /></a>As tempting as the new <strong>MacBook Airs</strong> are, there’s still other options such as the <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0047DVWLW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B0047DVWLW">iPad</a></strong>  and the new <strong>2011 Mac Mini’s</strong> to consider too. This is another avenue I could go with as I already have all the <strong>Mac peripherals</strong> –  I could <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004YLCLM6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B004YLCLM6">buy the cheaper Mac Mini</a></strong> for desktop computing use  and <strong>buy the iPad 2</strong> for the portable stuff  like email, web browsing and all those funky apps for sale at the <a href="http://www.apple.com" title="apple app store">App store</a>. The cost for a new Mac Mini and iPad would be pretty close to the price of a new MacBook Air or 13 inch MacBook Pro. One reason I haven’t jumped on the iPad bandwagon as of yet is the fact that  I wonder if I would be able to live with the iPad as a notebook replacement?</p>

<p>I know I can buy iPad accessories and keyboards, but then you may as well buy a MacBook Air that offers a full sized keyboard. The iPad scares me as I need to touch type and the lack of a tactile feel of a real keyboard is an important thing to me. I’ve spent some time with the iPad and it’s fine for sending off 100 words or less in an email but I wonder if I could actually type with one as my one  and only portable computing device?</p>

<p><strong>Which Mac Do I Buy?</strong></p>

<p>Here’s the thing: I don’t need to buy a new Mac today, as much as I’d like to think I do.</p>

<p>I think the answer to this question is to ask yourself: Do you need a new computer today?  Not want – <strong>need</strong>. It’s easy to get sucked in to the Apple marketing machine and make no mistake I’m their biggest fan (or sucker) , but <strong>if you don’t need a new Mac  don’t buy one</strong>.</p>

<p>Use the Mac (or PC even) you already own and spend a fraction on <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="apple upgrades">new upgrades</a> for your <a href="http://www.lowendmac.com" title="lowendmac.com">old Mac</a>, as opposed to replacing it. I have lost thousands of dollars spending money on  Apple computers I didn’t really need. I wanted them, sure. But needed, no. If you can swing it the best thing to do is to upgrade the RAM to the maximum on your Apple computer.</p>

<p>You may find that with a RAM upgrade, you don’t even need to buy a new Apple computer and  I just saved you $1000 or more as  <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="best apple memory upgrades">a memory upgrade for the Mac you already own is the best Apple deal you can buy</a></strong>. And now with the fact that <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/best-ssd-hard-drives-for-2011/" title="Best SSD Hard Drives for 2011"><strong>solid state hard drives are getting cheaper and cheaper</strong> </a>with some starting at under $100 today, it’s quite possible for  under $200 to greatly improve the performance of the computer you already own and have paid for. This is the **best Apple deal you can find today **and is much cheaper than buying a new 2011 computer from Apple.</p>

<p><strong>An 8GB RAM Upgrade does not cost much at all. </strong></p>

<p><strong> </strong>In fact, RAM for the Apple MacBook Pros released in February 2011 has never been cheaper, and if you’re looking to upgrade an older MacBook Pro from 2009 or 2010 – even though the 2011 and 2010 MacBook Pros use different RAM (1333MHz sodimms vs 1066Mhz sodimms) the prices for an upgrade to the MacBook Pro’s maximum could cost you less than $50 if you trade in your old 4GB RAM.</p>

<p><strong>Let’s have a look, shall we?</strong></p>

<p>For a 2011 MacBook Pro, regardless of screen size or cost the ram required is a<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/8GB">n <strong>8GB DDR3 SDRAM sodimm memory upgrade kit</strong>,</a> where most memory stores will happily sell you, (see ram price chart for MacBook Pros below)  but the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/cheapest-ram-upgrades-for-apple-computers-july-25-2011/" title="Cheapest RAM Upgrades for Apple Computers. July 25, 2011">cheapest MacBook Pro RAM</a> currently sits at about $<strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002YUF8ZG/ref=as_li_ss_til?tag=ramseeker-20&amp;camp=213381&amp;creative=390973&amp;linkCode=as4&amp;creativeASIN=B002YUF8ZG&amp;adid=1M72YM31597Z6H77GVMK&amp;">55 for  an 8GB upgrade</a></strong>, quite the price drop from the $90 or so the market demanded for MacBook Pro RAM just a few  months prior to today.</p>

<p>But to max out the memory on your MacBook Pro, you’ll need to replace the 2x2GB memory upgrade modules that shipped standard with your Apple notebook and replace them with 2x4GB memory modules.</p>

<p>This leaves you with an extra 4GB of MacBook Pro RAM, you’re not really sure what to do with, but you have a few options to make the upgrade from 4GB to 8GB even cheaper:</p>

<p><strong>Sell your memory online</strong><br />
<a href="http://www.craigslist.org"> craigslist </a>and <a href="http://www.ebay.com">ebay </a>are great sites to make money from your old RAM, effectively reducing the total cost of your 8GB MacBook Pro RAM upgrade</p>

<p><strong>Trade in your memory </strong><br />
There’s more  than one memory store that will apply your old MacBook Pro RAM  to  the total cost of your 8GB upgrade</p>

<p><strong>Donate your memory</strong> there’s lots of  organizations that will take your memory  donation  where they can sell it and use the proceeds from your old memory to support their cause.  <a href="http://www.salvationarmyusa.org/usn/www_usn_2.nsf">Salvation Army</a> and <a href="http://www.salvationarmyusa.org/usn/www_usn_2.nsf">Goodwill </a>will take memory upgrade donations, or perhaps there’s a school or other way  to help others with your factory, but still perfectly usable 4GB memory upgrade.</p>

<p>To summarize, if you buy RAM for MacBook Pro that’s not only the cheapest it’s ever been (now is the best time to buy Apple Memory) but sell or donate the MacBook Pro’s factory installed memory you should be able to realize a total cost of under $50 for an 8GB MacBook Pro Memory Upgrade</p>

<p> </p>

<p>This 4GB RAM module is compatible with pretty much every Apple computer current in 2011:</p>

<p>MacBook Pro notebook computers requires the use of two of these memory upgrade modules to max out your memory in 2011, and with the iMac, and for all but the cheapest iMac – you’ll need to buy two of these memory modules to add another 8GB of iMac RAM, and with the release of the new Apple Mac Minis, this is another Apple computer that can  use the maximum of 8GB by <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002YU83YO/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=B002YU83YO">buying two of these corsair 4GB RAM modules</a></strong>.</p>

<p>Of course,  there’s numerous notebook manufacturers that recommend the use of ddr3 sodimms for ram upgrades and most notebooks can take 8GB easy so make your windows machine run faster with the maximum ram possible as it’s so so cheap now.</p>

<p>If either saving money on RAM or the corsair brand doesn’t work for you there’s other solutions when it comes to buying 4GB DDR3 notebook memory on sale.</p>

<p>One of the first things I tend to ask when any new model of <a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple computer</a> is introduced is <strong>what kind of RAM does the Mac Mini require</strong>? And, as I had guessed with the speed bump in a processor to Intel Core i5 processors also comes a speed bump in ram speed as well and with the release of this small and cheap computer from Apple the ram speed required is increased from <strong>1066Mhz sodimms to 1333Mhz sodimms</strong>. The maximum RAM on the Mac Minis is 8GB by installing <strong><a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT2KIT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1339">two 4GB DDR3 1333MHz sodimms</a>,</strong> as per Apple although you can buy 16GB Mac Mini RAM it’s not something I suggest at this time mostly due to price: <strong>You could have an entire lineup of Mac Minis for what a 16GB Mac Mini memory upgrade kit will cost you today.</strong></p>

<p>[table id=13 /]</p>

<p>The only currently shipping Mac that requires different memory is the Apple Mac Pro as it uses DDR3 SDRAM DIMMS as opposed to DDR3 SDRAM sodimms usually designed for notebook compouters. If you have more than one current 2011 Apple computer at your home or place of work, it’s quite possible for you to swap out the RAM from both or either the Apple iMac or MacBook Pro because with the release of the Mac Mini, <strong>three out of four Macs all use the exact same memory</strong>.</p>

<p>When the Mac Minis were <a href="http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/mac_mini/index-macmini.html" title="first mac minis">first introduced</a> you really were not supposed to upgrade the RAM on this small desktop as the RAM was hard to get to and would or could void your warranty.</p>

<p>But with the release of the 2011 Apple Mac Mini, that’s all changed (the 2010 Apple Mac Minis were the same too) and ease of memory installation on these cheap desktops is now encouraged and even promoted as a selling feature on the <a href="http://www.apple.com/macmini/" title="apple mac mini">Mac Mini</a> page at Apple. How times have changed.</p>

<p>**A word about Mac Mini RAM Upgrades<br />
**</p>

<p>If you buy memory from Apple for your Apple Mac Mini, you will very likely have no problems with your Mac Mini RAM, not to mention the fact that this makes buying a Mac Mini even easier as you can buy both the memory and computer from the same online store. (not to mention the keyboard, mouse and display too).</p>

<p>What Apple doesn’t tell you is that compared to other name brand memory manufacturers the ram the sell for all Apple products is very expensive. You could argue that of course generic RAM for Mac Mini is going to be the cheaper RAM, but this applies to the brand name memory too. In fact, if you want the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com">cheapest RAM for Mac Mini</a>, regardless of brand I have found it to be from Corsair which is a reputable brand name for Mac Mini RAM. If you have another $300 to spend buy the Apple RAM but if you want to save money on RAM for the Mac Mini you have better choices that will cost you considerably less.</p>

<p>**2.3GHz Apple Mac Mini<br />
**</p>

<p>This is the Mac Mini I’m going to buy in the near future. If you’re like me you already have picked up an external monitor and have an extra keyboard or mouse kicking around so paying extra for all the, um, extras might not make a whole lot of sense and this Mac Mini will do just fine for a lot of us looking to use the Mac Mini as a file server, or even replacement for a new desktop computer.</p>

<p>**Newer Faster Processors<br />
** This is a long time coming this new Mac Mini refresh and even though the 2010 Mac Mini was fast, the second generation Intel i5 and i7 processors change the game and now these small desktops offer the same computing power as some other desktop computers costing more and not offering the advantages of the Apple operating system including the newly released OSX Lion – Apple’s latest and newest operating system that’s included free of charge when you buy the 2.3GHz Mac Mini.</p>

<p>**Connect with Thunderbolt Technology and more<br />
**</p>

<p>I saw this coming. First available with the Apple MacBook Pros it makes complete sense for Apple to include this new technology in the Mac Minis, but for some reason I can’t see or get excited about the thunderbolt port. But I’m not connecting a whole whack of peripherals at one time, and I think for most of us who want to just buy the cheapest Mac they can, this feature could be lost. What’s more important when it comes to ports on the back of the Mac Mini is the 4 USB ports and HDMI port that offers a one cable solution for connecting the Mac Mini to your HDTV. The option of being able to connect two displays to the Mac Mini at the same time makes for a nice touch though and the fact that you can use whatever peripheral you’ve got kicking around and use it with these new Macs offers more value than the thunderbolt stuff at this time.</p>

<p>**More, for less.<br />
**</p>

<p>I could be wrong, but if I recall the MSRP on the 2010 Mac Mini was higher at about $699 so the new Mac Mini’s don’t just offer more speed they also offer a cheaper overall price. The 2.3GHz Mac Mini is the best price you can get on a new Mac today and unless you need portability or need to buy all the apple peripherals, where the savings when you add the 2.3 GHz to the cost of the keyboard, display and mouse might mean a better deal would be to buy the cheap iMac instead as the iMac ships with all the peripherals included right out of the box.</p>

<p>**Faster Graphics.<br />
**<br />
This is important if you’re gaming, editing movies or simply for video playback at home you want to be sure that your graphics card is up to the task when called upon and the fastest computer won’t do you any good if there’s a bottleneck when it comes time to display. According to Apple this won’t be the case thanks to the much faster graphics card on the 2.3GHz Mac Mini as the AMD Radeon HD graphics processor with 256MB of GDDR5 memory packs more punch than ever before with some applications offering twice as fast graphics than the 2010 Mac Mini this computer replaces.</p>

<p>Bluetooth and Wifi are pretty standard fare in 2011 so I don’t think I need to spend too much time with these topics and suffice it to say that the 2011 Mac Mini offers both these technologies</p>

<p>**2.5 GHz Apple Mac Mini<br />
**</p>

<p>Apple offers an even faster Mac Mini for $799, and save for the extra $200 and faster processor: Intel Core i5 2.3GHz vs Intel Core i5 2.5Ghz, more memory (2GB vs 4GB) and a faster video card as the main differences between the two Mac Mini models, there’s not much else to write about the more expensive Mac Mini and if it were my money, I’d save it and buy more RAM and save the difference for your next Mac Mini or future Mac from Apple.</p>

<p><strong>Save Money on the 2011 Apple  Mac Mini</strong></p>

<p>It’s not much, but  if you <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26x%3D0%26ref_%3Dnb_sb_noss%26y%3D0%26field-keywords%3Dmac%2520mini%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps%23&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">buy a Mac Mini at Amazon</a></strong>  you can save over the full MSRP  of  what Apple charges with current savings on new Mac Minis only being $5 or so as these are new machines from Apple, it’s still a savings and worth a mention.</p>

<p>Also, check out MacMall for <strong><a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-1548159-10847025">Mac Mini Bargains</a></strong>, especially if you can live with a 2010 Mac Mini as now is the time to buy a discontinued Mac Mini for even more savings as the discontinued models get liquidated to make room for the faster 2011 Mac Mini models.</p>

<p>In fact, if  you consider that your HP notebook already ships with some  memory that you can sell or  trade your HP notebook upgrade, regardless of model number will cost you less than you think.  Most HP notebook computers manufactured in 2011 are capable of accepting and recognizing 8GB of RAM so why not spend the $50 or so to max out your HP notebook to the maximum performance potential?</p>

Yet, if you replace the stock HP memory for RAM that will allow this ProBook notebook to run faster and  allow you to be more efficient you can get more work done, and the HP ProBook RAM Upgrade is pretty cheap for this notebook too. You’ll need to buy <strong><a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-1548159-10273954?url=http://www.crucial.com/store/affiliateredirect.asp?imodule=CT2KIT51264BC1067&amp;aid=1027395&amp;cid=777292&amp;subid=89&amp;PRS&amp;uscj&amp;cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1067">2x4GB DDR3 1066Mhz sdram sodimms</a> </strong> for this HP notebook, and as there’s only two memory upgrade slots in this HP notebook you’ll need to remove the RAM  installed in the HP ProBook 4525 and replace it with the bigger memory upgrade modules for HP notebooks.</p>

This a faster and more expensive notebook than the probook above (still a great deal on a HP computer though)  and offers <strong>faster 2nd generation processors</strong> than what’s in the HP ProBook. But the same applies to the HP DM4-2070 too, and even though its’ a faster HP computer to begin with, when you add more memory you get a faster computer. This HP notebook computer uses RAM that’s different than the memory above and this time you need to buy <strong><a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT2KIT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1339">8GB DDR3 SDRAM SODIMM</a></strong> notebook computer memory kits running at 1333Mhz. The maximum RAM  for the  DM4-2070 is still the maximum of 8GB (not too many notebooks offer 16GB of RAM, yet) and again you can replace the factory RAM from HP with cheaper and faster HP memory to take this HP notebook model all the way to 8GB.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2011/07/do-the-new-imacs-take-notebook-memory/">Do The New iMacs Take NoteBook Memory?</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>Some stores even claim to have Apple Certified RAM, but it’s a good guess that many of these memory shops really only sell generic RAM that  meets the iMac’s technical requirements for memory upgrades. I’ve found that lately,  and completely opposite of recent  times when the only way you could get cheap iMac RAM would be to buy generic memory for the iMacs, but now in 2011 the <a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT2KIT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1339">brand name memory has dropped  so much in price for that 8GB of iMac RAM</a> can cost just over $50 if you shop around  for some deals on iMac RAM.</p>

<p>In 2011, for the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/new-2011-apple-imac-models-announced/" title="New 2011 Apple iMac Models Announced">iMac models introduced in May</a>, these new desktop computers by Apple use the same <strong><a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT2KIT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1339">1333 Mhz DDR3 sodimms</a></strong> that the Apple MacBook Pros use (current 2011 models) so you could effectively swap out the RAM from your iMac to your MacBook Pro. Why you’d want to do that is beyond me, but yes to upgrade RAM for the new iMacs all you have to do is be sure the memory you want to buy meets the memory requirements as determined by Apple.Yes, they do.</p>

<p>This applies to all four models of the iMacs too – all the way from the cheapest iMac with  the $1199 price tag, to the fastest iMac with a huge and visually stunning  27 inch LCD display. They all require DDR3 1333MHz sodimms, which are essentially notebook memory and the current memory for a lot of notebooks from brands other than Apple such as Dell, HP, Acer, and the like. It’s all the same memory.</p>

<p>Because I do what I do, I  have found some <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com">pretty good prices on iMac memory</a>:</p>

		<div class="post-content"><p>MacBook Pros aren’t that much better and are even more expensive than the MacBook Air, with the 13  inch MacBook Pro still going  to cost you $1199.oo as your cheapest MacBook Pro option and the price can go up from there – depending on the screen size and configuration you end up with.</p>

<p>But, back to the <strong>MacBook Pro and  the disadvantages it may have</strong>,  and the very first thing that came to mind is that <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I" title="Cheap MacBook Pros ">MacBook Pros are freaking expensive</a></strong>.

Sure, it’s got the cachet that only comes with an Apple product but for what is essentially <strong>Apple’s answer to a netbook</strong>, the $999 sticker price is a <strong>lot more than you’ll pay for a netbook running the windows OS</strong> that will probably run you about $200 or so. Is theI’m an Apple Fan, and have been for some time. In fact,  this site started as just a hobby site. I bought web hosting, taught myself some basic html and have been listing the <strong>best prices on RAM I could find</strong> for close to fifteen years. Not  only <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/macbook-pro-ddr3-1333mhz-memory-upgrade-prices/" title="macbook pro ram">MacBook Pro RAM</a></strong>but also I’ve even managed to <strong>swing a few memory deals for you folks over the years</strong> and some stores offer ram prices that are substantially lower than you could find anywhere else and are heavily discounted just for you.</p>

<p><strong>The cloud doesn’t care about your OS.</strong></p>

<p>When I started this site and  on a Mac of course, (I think it was an Apple IIci if I recall. I’m dating myself) I had to have programs to run and files to edit and the <strong>Apple  operating system was leaps and bounds better than anything Windows</strong> related.</p>

<p>But now in 2011, I work in the  cloud. I’m writing this with a 2008  MacBook for the simple reason I see no reason to upgrade my MacBook Pro at this time with anything better or bigger. And, I can’t  believe I’m going to confess this, but <strong>I could do just fine on a $399 (or less) windows notebook:</strong></p>

<p>The programs I use are:</p>

<p><strong><a href="&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004LCK1GG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B004LCK1GG&quot;">Photoshop Elements</a></strong>for the odd banner or graphics tweak. There’s a windows version too. It costs less if I remember for the windows version too. (but this may have changed)</p>

<p>FTP Program. I use <strong><a href="http://www.panic.com" title="best ftp software">Transmit</a></strong>, and  have for years.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.wordpress.org" title="free blogging software">WordPress</a>, which is a free download.</p>

<p>I’ve been working away on a Windows notebook I bought a few years ago for the past month or so as a test to see if I could handle using a <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fbestsellers%2Felectronics%2F565108%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref_%3Dzg_bs_nav%23&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">much cheaper notebook PC</a></strong> as my one and only computer – and  for the most  part and for my needs (yours may differ) I really don’t notice much of a difference between the two OS’s and my 15 inch HP notebook cost me a fraction of a new MacBook Pro and for what I do, does the trick just fine.</p>

<p>This isn’t to say that the Apple MacBook Pro isn’t really worth it, and I appreciate the way the <strong>Mac OS just works</strong> without  having to fiddle  with operating systems and dll files and viruses and the like, and with twenty years plus of Apple computer use under my belt, it’s  hard to train an old dog new tricks. I still can’t get used to the right click thing with the windows OS, either Vista or Windows 7.</p>

<p>But for the up front savings when you compare a MacBook Pro to a Windows notebook, I wonder: <strong>will my next Mac be a Windows PC?</strong></p>

<p>Dell memory can be a good deal if you know <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="cheapest dell memory">where to shop for memory</a></strong> and like the<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/dell-inspiron-15r-2nd-generation-laptop-memory-upgrades/" title="Dell Inspiron 15R 2nd Generation Laptop Memory Upgrades"> Inspiron 15R 2nd  generation </a>and <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/dell-inspiron-17r-2nd-generation-laptop-memory-upgrades/" title="Dell Inspiron 17R 2nd Generation Laptop Memory Upgrades">17r second  generation models</a>, the higher power dells built for professionals, gamers, or anybody else needing a faster notebook than shat the Inspiron models can offer could do worse than <strong>pick up a Dell XPS 15.</strong></p>

<p>I’ll get this out of the way now. I’m an Apple fan, but over the years as the <strong>PC manufacturers have dropped their prices over and over</strong> to the point where you can pay less than $500 for a well equipped Dell notebook it’s almost hard to justify the cost of a new  Apple MacBook Pro,  when the closest competitor to the MacBook, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004XZMBS2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B004XZMBS2"><strong>Dell XPS 15</strong> </a>will do the job in all but a few cases, will do the job for half the price as we become more and more reliant on cloud computing and less reliant on software or operating system.  <a href="http://www.facebook.com">FaceBook </a>looks pretty much the same on both Mac or PC.</p>

<p>Like all things with computer shopping, you can add software, mice, faster processors and a plethora of other factors to bump up the price of your next Dell, but one  thing you should seriously consider is buying  more memory for your Dell XPS as  this is one powerful windows 7 equipped notebook PC.</p>

<p><img class="size-full wp-image-2445 alignright" title="Cheap Dell XPS 15" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/71-RWyLwXVL._AA1500_.jpg" alt="Best Price on XPS 15" width="500" height="500" /></p>

<p>The <strong>cheapest Dell XPS configuration</strong> ships standard with a fast 2nd generation  processor that features an Intel Core i5 processor  running at 2.0Ghz, and out of the box ships standard with <strong><a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT51264BC1339%22">4GB of factory installed Dell Memory</a></strong>  (an aside: there’s  no such thing as special Dell memory. As long as the memory you buy meets the  Dell XPS 15 memory reqirements , you’re good to go)</p>

<p>But you should really <strong>upgrade your Dell XPS 15 memory</strong> to  the maximum ram possible  for the Dell XPS 15, as that’s an upgrade that is really going  to speed up your Dell XPS computer.</p>

<p>What you don’t want to do is buy the RAM from Dell when you order your Dell XPS. You can  but you will pay for the ram upgrade more  through  Dell than you would elsewhere.  At the  time I write this you can buy  <strong><a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT2KIT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1339">8GB of Dell XPS RAM</a></strong> for about half price elsewhere than if you were buy the RAM directly from Dell when you place the Dell XPS order at Dell.com.</p>

<p>That’s a significant savings on Dell Memory and I keep track of  what’s  going on  with Dell Memory so you can save money when it comes time to <strong>buy Dell XPS 15</strong>.</p>

<p>Ulitmately, the answer would be to upgrade **both ram **and **hard drive for MacBook Pro **at the same time.</p>

<p>It’s best to upgrade both the MacBook Pro RAM and hard drive for the ultimate advantage and to get the <strong>fastest speed out of your MacBook Pro,</strong> regardless of whether you’re interested in upgrading a MBP for a 13 inch, 15 inch and even 17 inch model assuming you didn’t care about budget you could easily afford both a RAM upgrade and hard drive at the same time.</p>

<p>**Upgrade Your MacBook Pro RAM First **</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/macbook-pro-ddr3-1333mhz-memory-upgrade-prices/">MacBook Pro RAM upgrades</a> are cheap and affordable, and a faster hard drive won’t do you any good if you’ve got a bottleneck with RAM and the processor is relying on much slower swap disc when it comes to needing to access data quickly and efficiently. If you’re just browsing the web, and what has become an increasing activity over time, and will only get more and more prevalent as time goes on thanks in part to the release of Apple’s iCloud there’s a good chance you don’t have to upgrade the memory on your Apple pro notebook computer.</p>

<p>But RAM for MacBook Pro in 2011 is the <strong><a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT2KIT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1339">cheapest it’s been in some time</a></strong>, so if you were wondering on when to <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com">buy Apple memory</a>, the time would be now as <strong>prices have never been lower for MacBook ram than right now</strong>. It’s the lowest I have seen ram prices and you can now <strong><a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT2KIT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1339">buy 8GB of MacBook RAM for well under $100</a>.</strong> You can also order 16GB memory but for the time being it’s still too pricey for me to recommend unless you have deep pockets or need the most memory you can install in a MacBook Pro regardless of Cost.</p>

<p>**Buy a Faster Hard Drive<br />
**</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003NE5JCE/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=B003NE5JCE"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2430" title="Cheapest Solid State Hard Drive" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screen-shot-2011-07-07-at-2.53.37-PM.png" alt="Solid state hard drive under $100" width="298" height="260" /></a></p>

<p>Your MacBook Pro already comes shipped with a fast hard drive installed, and the only way to really upgrade the MacBook Pro hard drive would be to upgrade to a larger sized hard drive that won’t really speed things up, but rather just allow you more space for your files, movies and images.</p>

<p>The best bet for a MacBook Pro hard drive upgrade in 2011 is to convert or swap out the hard drive in your MacBook Pro for a much more dependable and <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/best-ssd-hard-drives-for-2011/" title="Best SSD Hard Drives for 2011">faster solid state hard drive</a>. The downside to this advice is that to get a large SSD hard drive installed in your MacBook Pro you’re looking at big bucks. A 500gb solid state hard isn’t really available yet and even a 250GB solid state hard drive comes with a sticker price of $600, and that is in my opinion still too expensive.</p>

<p>But, if you can live with the smaller hard drive space a <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003NE5JCE/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=B003NE5JCE">64GB solid state hard drive</a></strong> is <strong>cheap and affordable solid state hard drive</strong> and at the time of writing just under $100 too. What you could do, is install your MacBook hard drive in an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref_%3Dnb_sb_ss_c_1_23%26field-keywords%3D500gb%2520solid%2520state%2520drive%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Delectronics%26sprefix%3D500gb%2520solid%2520state%2520drive%23%3Furl%3Dsearch-alias%3Delectronics&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">external hard drive case</a> allowing you the best of both worlds: A fast solid state hard drive for fast startup and access to commonly used files and and with your factory MacBook Pro hard drive installed in an external USB case you now have space for your less often used files or for a backup and you still make good use out of the factory MacBook Pro hard drive.</p>

<p>**Upgrade MacBook Pro Hard Drive and RAM<br />
**</p>

<p>If you really shop around, you can <strong>max out the ram on your MacBook Pro for well under $100</strong> and <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003NE5JCE/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=B003NE5JCE">add a 64GB solid state hard drive</a></strong> for right at the $100 mark. Add a negligible cost for your USB hard drive case and you’ve got the <strong>most ram and a faster hard drive in your MacBook Pro for under $200</strong> (plus taxes, and shipping). If I were to <strong>buy a new MacBook Pro</strong>, or even wanted to <strong>upgrade an older MacBook Pro</strong> this is the route I would go as once you spend the relatively cheap amount of about $200 you are taking full advantage of the technology hidden inside your Apple MacBook Pro notebook computer.</p>
