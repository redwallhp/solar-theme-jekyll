<p>It will not cost much at all to <strong><a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT2KIT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1339">buy more ram for your HP notebook</a></strong> at the best price I could find.</p>

<p>In fact, if  you consider that your HP notebook already ships with some  memory that you can sell or  trade your HP notebook upgrade, regardless of model number will cost you less than you think.  Most HP notebook computers manufactured in 2011 are capable of accepting and recognizing 8GB of RAM so why not spend the $50 or so to max out your HP notebook to the maximum performance potential?</p>

<p>One of the <strong>best selling HP notebooks</strong> you can buy today is the HP ProBook 4525 (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0046UY3X0/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=B0046UY3X0">currently on sale at Amazon for under $500</a>) and this notebook allows up to 8GB of RAM, yet only comes shipped with 2GB. Yet, if you replace the stock HP memory for RAM that will allow this ProBook notebook to run faster and  allow you to be more efficient you can get more work done, and the HP ProBook RAM Upgrade is pretty cheap for this notebook too. You’ll need to buy <strong><a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-1548159-10273954?url=http://www.crucial.com/store/affiliateredirect.asp?imodule=CT2KIT51264BC1067&amp;aid=1027395&amp;cid=777292&amp;subid=89&amp;PRS&amp;uscj&amp;cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1067">2x4GB DDR3 1066Mhz sdram sodimms</a> </strong> for this HP notebook, and as there’s only two memory upgrade slots in this HP notebook you’ll need to remove the RAM  installed in the HP ProBook 4525 and replace it with the bigger memory upgrade modules for HP notebooks.</p>

This a faster and more expensive notebook than the probook above (still a great deal on a HP computer though)  and offers <strong>faster 2nd generation processors</strong> than what’s in the HP ProBook. But the same applies to the HP DM4-2070 too, and even though its’ a faster HP computer to begin with, when you add more memory you get a faster computer. This HP notebook computer uses RAM that’s different than the memory above and this time you need to buy <strong><a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT2KIT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1339">8GB DDR3 SDRAM SODIMM</a></strong> notebook computer memory kits running at 1333Mhz. The maximum RAM  for the  DM4-2070 is still the maximum of 8GB (not too many notebooks offer 16GB of RAM, yet) and again you can replace the factory RAM from HP with cheaper and faster HP memory to take this HP notebook model all the way to 8GB.</p>

Although I’ve yet to test either HP notebook,  I can be pretty sure just due to the <strong>memory requirements of the HP Probook 4525</strong> that it will be the slower notebook when you compare the two computer notebooks from HP side by side.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2011/07/do-the-new-imacs-take-notebook-memory/">Do The New iMacs Take NoteBook Memory?</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>Some stores even claim to have Apple Certified RAM, but it’s a good guess that many of these memory shops really only sell generic RAM that  meets the iMac’s technical requirements for memory upgrades. I’ve found that lately,  and completely opposite of recent  times when the only way you could get cheap iMac RAM would be to buy generic memory for the iMacs, but now in 2011 the <a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT2KIT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1339">brand name memory has dropped  so much in price for that 8GB of iMac RAM</a> can cost just over $50 if you shop around  for some deals on iMac RAM.</p>

<p>In 2011, for the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/new-2011-apple-imac-models-announced/" title="New 2011 Apple iMac Models Announced">iMac models introduced in May</a>, these new desktop computers by Apple use the same <strong><a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT2KIT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1339">1333 Mhz DDR3 sodimms</a></strong> that the Apple MacBook Pros use (current 2011 models) so you could effectively swap out the RAM from your iMac to your MacBook Pro. Why you’d want to do that is beyond me, but yes to upgrade RAM for the new iMacs all you have to do is be sure the memory you want to buy meets the memory requirements as determined by Apple.Yes, they do.</p>

<p>This applies to all four models of the iMacs too – all the way from the cheapest iMac with  the $1199 price tag, to the fastest iMac with a huge and visually stunning  27 inch LCD display. They all require DDR3 1333MHz sodimms, which are essentially notebook memory and the current memory for a lot of notebooks from brands other than Apple such as Dell, HP, Acer, and the like. It’s all the same memory.</p>

<p>Because I do what I do, I  have found some <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com">pretty good prices on iMac memory</a>:</p>

    <h1><a href="/2011/07/what-are-the-disadvantages-of-a-macbook-pro/">What are the Disadvantages of  a MacBook Pro?</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>MacBook Pros aren’t that much better and are even more expensive than the MacBook Air, with the 13  inch MacBook Pro still going  to cost you $1199.oo as your cheapest MacBook Pro option and the price can go up from there – depending on the screen size and configuration you end up with.</p>

<p>But, back to the <strong>MacBook Pro and  the disadvantages it may have</strong>,  and the very first thing that came to mind is that <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I" title="Cheap MacBook Pros ">MacBook Pros are freaking expensive</a></strong>. Even the <strong>cheapest mac you can buy, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013FK9U2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=B0013FK9U2" title="cheapest apple computer">Mac Mini</a></strong> is a $700 purchase, and the cheapest way you can get  into any MacBook of any kind  is with an <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0047DVRQW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=B0047DVRQW">11 inch MacBook Air</a></strong>. Sure, it’s got the cachet that only comes with an Apple product but for what is essentially <strong>Apple’s answer to a netbook</strong>, the $999 sticker price is a <strong>lot more than you’ll pay for a netbook running the windows OS</strong> that will probably run you about $200 or so. Is theI’m an Apple Fan, and have been for some time. In fact,  this site started as just a hobby site. I bought web hosting, taught myself some basic html and have been listing the <strong>best prices on RAM I could find</strong> for close to fifteen years. Not  only <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/macbook-pro-ddr3-1333mhz-memory-upgrade-prices/" title="macbook pro ram">MacBook Pro RAM</a></strong>but also I’ve even managed to <strong>swing a few memory deals for you folks over the years</strong> and some stores offer ram prices that are substantially lower than you could find anywhere else and are heavily discounted just for you.</p>

<p><strong>The cloud doesn’t care about your OS.</strong></p>

<p>When I started this site and  on a Mac of course, (I think it was an Apple IIci if I recall. I’m dating myself) I had to have programs to run and files to edit and the <strong>Apple  operating system was leaps and bounds better than anything Windows</strong> related.</p>

<p>But now in 2011, I work in the  cloud. I’m writing this with a 2008  MacBook for the simple reason I see no reason to upgrade my MacBook Pro at this time with anything better or bigger. And, I can’t  believe I’m going to confess this, but <strong>I could do just fine on a $399 (or less) windows notebook:</strong></p>

<p>The programs I use are:</p>

<p><strong><a href="&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004LCK1GG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B004LCK1GG&quot;">Photoshop Elements</a></strong>for the odd banner or graphics tweak. There’s a windows version too. It costs less if I remember for the windows version too. (but this may have changed)</p>

<p>FTP Program. I use <strong><a href="http://www.panic.com" title="best ftp software">Transmit</a></strong>, and  have for years.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.wordpress.org" title="free blogging software">WordPress</a>, which is a free download.</p>

<p>I’ve been working away on a Windows notebook I bought a few years ago for the past month or so as a test to see if I could handle using a <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fbestsellers%2Felectronics%2F565108%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref_%3Dzg_bs_nav%23&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">much cheaper notebook PC</a></strong> as my one and only computer – and  for the most  part and for my needs (yours may differ) I really don’t notice much of a difference between the two OS’s and my 15 inch HP notebook cost me a fraction of a new MacBook Pro and for what I do, does the trick just fine.</p>

<p>This isn’t to say that the Apple MacBook Pro isn’t really worth it, and I appreciate the way the <strong>Mac OS just works</strong> without  having to fiddle  with operating systems and dll files and viruses and the like, and with twenty years plus of Apple computer use under my belt, it’s  hard to train an old dog new tricks. I still can’t get used to the right click thing with the windows OS, either Vista or Windows 7.</p>

<p>But for the up front savings when you compare a MacBook Pro to a Windows notebook, I wonder: <strong>will my next Mac be a Windows PC?</strong></p>

<p>Dell memory can be a good deal if you know <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="cheapest dell memory">where to shop for memory</a></strong> and like the<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/dell-inspiron-15r-2nd-generation-laptop-memory-upgrades/" title="Dell Inspiron 15R 2nd Generation Laptop Memory Upgrades"> Inspiron 15R 2nd  generation </a>and <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/dell-inspiron-17r-2nd-generation-laptop-memory-upgrades/" title="Dell Inspiron 17R 2nd Generation Laptop Memory Upgrades">17r second  generation models</a>, the higher power dells built for professionals, gamers, or anybody else needing a faster notebook than shat the Inspiron models can offer could do worse than <strong>pick up a Dell XPS 15.</strong></p>

<p>I’ll get this out of the way now. I’m an Apple fan, but over the years as the <strong>PC manufacturers have dropped their prices over and over</strong> to the point where you can pay less than $500 for a well equipped Dell notebook it’s almost hard to justify the cost of a new  Apple MacBook Pro,  when the closest competitor to the MacBook, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004XZMBS2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B004XZMBS2"><strong>Dell XPS 15</strong> </a>will do the job in all but a few cases, will do the job for half the price as we become more and more reliant on cloud computing and less reliant on software or operating system.  <a href="http://www.facebook.com">FaceBook </a>looks pretty much the same on both Mac or PC.</p>

<p>Like all things with computer shopping, you can add software, mice, faster processors and a plethora of other factors to bump up the price of your next Dell, but one  thing you should seriously consider is buying  more memory for your Dell XPS as  this is one powerful windows 7 equipped notebook PC.</p>

<p>The <strong>cheapest Dell XPS configuration</strong> ships standard with a fast 2nd generation  processor that features an Intel Core i5 processor  running at 2.0Ghz, and out of the box ships standard with <strong><a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT51264BC1339%22">4GB of factory installed Dell Memory</a></strong>  (an aside: there’s  no such thing as special Dell memory. As long as the memory you buy meets the  Dell XPS 15 memory reqirements , you’re good to go)</p>

<p>But you should really <strong>upgrade your Dell XPS 15 memory</strong> to  the maximum ram possible  for the Dell XPS 15, as that’s an upgrade that is really going  to speed up your Dell XPS computer.</p>

<p>What you don’t want to do is buy the RAM from Dell when you order your Dell XPS. You can  but you will pay for the ram upgrade more  through  Dell than you would elsewhere.  At the  time I write this you can buy  <strong><a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT2KIT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1339">8GB of Dell XPS RAM</a></strong> for about half price elsewhere than if you were buy the RAM directly from Dell when you place the Dell XPS order at Dell.com.</p>

<p>That’s a significant savings on Dell Memory and I keep track of  what’s  going on  with Dell Memory so you can save money when it comes time to <strong>buy Dell XPS 15</strong>.</p>

<p>Ulitmately, the answer would be to upgrade **both ram **and **hard drive for MacBook Pro **at the same time.</p>

<p>It’s best to upgrade both the MacBook Pro RAM and hard drive for the ultimate advantage and to get the <strong>fastest speed out of your MacBook Pro,</strong> regardless of whether you’re interested in upgrading a MBP for a 13 inch, 15 inch and even 17 inch model assuming you didn’t care about budget you could easily afford both a RAM upgrade and hard drive at the same time.</p>

<p>**Upgrade Your MacBook Pro RAM First **</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/macbook-pro-ddr3-1333mhz-memory-upgrade-prices/">MacBook Pro RAM upgrades</a> are cheap and affordable, and a faster hard drive won’t do you any good if you’ve got a bottleneck with RAM and the processor is relying on much slower swap disc when it comes to needing to access data quickly and efficiently. If you’re just browsing the web, and what has become an increasing activity over time, and will only get more and more prevalent as time goes on thanks in part to the release of Apple’s iCloud there’s a good chance you don’t have to upgrade the memory on your Apple pro notebook computer.</p>

<p>But RAM for MacBook Pro in 2011 is the <strong><a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT2KIT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1339">cheapest it’s been in some time</a></strong>, so if you were wondering on when to <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com">buy Apple memory</a>, the time would be now as <strong>prices have never been lower for MacBook ram than right now</strong>. It’s the lowest I have seen ram prices and you can now <strong><a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT2KIT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1339">buy 8GB of MacBook RAM for well under $100</a>.</strong> You can also order 16GB memory but for the time being it’s still too pricey for me to recommend unless you have deep pockets or need the most memory you can install in a MacBook Pro regardless of Cost.</p>

<p>**Buy a Faster Hard Drive<br />
**</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003NE5JCE/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=B003NE5JCE"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2430" title="Cheapest Solid State Hard Drive" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screen-shot-2011-07-07-at-2.53.37-PM.png" alt="Solid state hard drive under $100" width="298" height="260" /></a></p>

<p>Your MacBook Pro already comes shipped with a fast hard drive installed, and the only way to really upgrade the MacBook Pro hard drive would be to upgrade to a larger sized hard drive that won’t really speed things up, but rather just allow you more space for your files, movies and images.</p>

<p>The best bet for a MacBook Pro hard drive upgrade in 2011 is to convert or swap out the hard drive in your MacBook Pro for a much more dependable and <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/best-ssd-hard-drives-for-2011/" title="Best SSD Hard Drives for 2011">faster solid state hard drive</a>. The downside to this advice is that to get a large SSD hard drive installed in your MacBook Pro you’re looking at big bucks. A 500gb solid state hard isn’t really available yet and even a 250GB solid state hard drive comes with a sticker price of $600, and that is in my opinion still too expensive.</p>

<p>But, if you can live with the smaller hard drive space a <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003NE5JCE/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=B003NE5JCE">64GB solid state hard drive</a></strong> is <strong>cheap and affordable solid state hard drive</strong> and at the time of writing just under $100 too. What you could do, is install your MacBook hard drive in an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref_%3Dnb_sb_ss_c_1_23%26field-keywords%3D500gb%2520solid%2520state%2520drive%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Delectronics%26sprefix%3D500gb%2520solid%2520state%2520drive%23%3Furl%3Dsearch-alias%3Delectronics&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">external hard drive case</a> allowing you the best of both worlds: A fast solid state hard drive for fast startup and access to commonly used files and and with your factory MacBook Pro hard drive installed in an external USB case you now have space for your less often used files or for a backup and you still make good use out of the factory MacBook Pro hard drive.</p>

<p>**Upgrade MacBook Pro Hard Drive and RAM<br />
**</p>

<p>If you really shop around, you can <strong>max out the ram on your MacBook Pro for well under $100</strong> and <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003NE5JCE/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=B003NE5JCE">add a 64GB solid state hard drive</a></strong> for right at the $100 mark. Add a negligible cost for your USB hard drive case and you’ve got the <strong>most ram and a faster hard drive in your MacBook Pro for under $200</strong> (plus taxes, and shipping). If I were to <strong>buy a new MacBook Pro</strong>, or even wanted to <strong>upgrade an older MacBook Pro</strong> this is the route I would go as once you spend the relatively cheap amount of about $200 you are taking full advantage of the technology hidden inside your Apple MacBook Pro notebook computer.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2011/07/what-is-the-best-amount-of-computer-memory/">What is the Best Amount of Computer Memory?</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p><strong>8GB Memory is the <a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT2KIT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1339">most affordable and most popular</a> computer memory upgrade today</strong></p>

<p>The answer to this question changes over the years, and ten years ago 1GB of RAM seemed like an unthinkable  amount of  computer ram to have installed and the price was just as unthinkable with it not uncommon to see RAM upgrades for 1GB  sell for one thousand dollars or more, but in 2011 not only have the memory modules gotten bigger over time, they have also gotten cheaper over time too, which means you spend  less money for more RAM upgrades now than ever before.</p>

<p>The good news for  most computer users is that  <strong>today’s computers ship with enough RAM</strong> to run the installed applications such as Windows 7 or Mac OSX and usually a web browser or two and for some every day computer users who just need to check the  weather and browse facebook then the factory  installed RAM is more than ample of an upgrade as we get closer and  closer to location free computing thanks to being able to work in the cloud.</p>

<p>But for the rest of us who like to get some work done, or play games  or edit videos  – the more RAM you have , the better. <strong>There’s no such thing as having too much RAM.</strong></p>

<p>Out of the box, notebook computers, probably the best selling computer today ship from the factory with 3 or 4GB of RAM already installed but  <strong>most notebooks today can use up to 8GB  of RAM</strong> with a few high powered graphics or business notebooks being able to accept 16GB of RAM, but the average and best selling ram upgrade is th<strong>e <a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT2KIT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1339">8GB DDR3 SDRAM memory upgrade kit</a></strong>.</p>

<p><strong>8GB of RAM for desktop or notebooks in 2011</strong> is the current sweet spot for memory upgrades. 4GB ram, while cheaper than 8GB obviously doesn’t double the RAM in your computer which is what you’re trying to do when you’re ready to buy RAM and 16GB RAM isn’t priced affordably enough yet to make the cost worthwhile for all but a few power users or early adapters to the bigger 8GB memory sodimms that are required as most notebooks can’t hold more than two memory upgrade modules at  a time.</p>

<p><strong>8GB Memory Prices</strong></p>

<p><strong>8GB DDR3 sodimms</strong> are the best selling and  most popular memory upgrade to date for computers, especially notebook and laptop computers</p>

    <h1><a href="/2011/06/apple-imac-27-inch-3-1ghz-memory-upgrades/">Apple iMac 27 inch 3.1GHz Memory Upgrades</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>The difference between this model of iMac and the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/apple-imac-intel-core-i5-2-7ghz-27-inch-memory-upgrades/" title="Apple iMac Intel Core i5 2.7GHz 27 inch Memory Upgrades">cheaper 2.7GHz model</a>, asides from the $300 discount is the faster video card  with more RAM: 1GB vs 512mb as what comes standard on all other Apple iMac models, resulting in faster video performance which is  more important for gaming than surfing <a href="http://www.facebook.com">facebook</a>. And if you buy the fast iMac from Apple directly you can configure this Apple iMac with even a faster processor running at  3.4Gz,  but in the  stock configuration you can <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004YLCE2S/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B004YLCE2S">buy the  3.1GHz</a></strong> is the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/new-2011-apple-imac-models-announced/" title="fastest apple iMac in 2011">fastest iMac that you can buy today from Apple</a>. All else pretty much the same. Apple offers a bigger hard drive option at 2TB, but you can upgrade the hard  drive for any iMac pretty easily so that’s not much of a feature, although if you are working in video or using large files like photoshop files or movies you can never have enough hard drive space, (or RAM, too)This specific <a href="http://www.apple.com/imac/" title="apple imac">Apple iMac</a> model is the <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004YLCE2S/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B004YLCE2S">fastest Apple iMac you can buy</a></strong> and also offers the biggest LCD display as well. Simply put, if you’re in the market for an Apple iMac and need the <strong>biggest and baddest Apple consumer desktop computer you can buy</strong>, then look no further than the Apple iMac 27 inch model running at 3.1 GHz.</p>

<p><strong>Is the faster 27 inch iMac worth it?</strong></p>

<p>I have already noted that I think the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/apple-imac-21-5-inch-2-7-ghz-memory-upgrades/" title="Apple iMac 21.5 inch 2.7 GHz Memory Upgrades">Apple iMac 21.5 inch </a>is the best deal out of the two 2011 21.5 inch Apple iMacs, but if you can afford the extra $500 from the price of this Apple iMac, than the <strong>extra screen real estate from 21.5  inches  to 27 inches is quite the jump</strong>, and probably will allow you to get more work done than the processor upgrade from 2.7Ghz to 3.1. GHz. If you are deciding on what iMac to buy, the 27 inch  2.7 GHz model might be the best deal just based on the fact of screen size alone.</p>

<p>I always like to <strong>compare prices of computers</strong>, where in 2011 more than ever there’s a good chance you can make money with your computer than ever before. Maybe you freelance in photography or writing and any money you make on the side could be used towards paying for your new iMac. The one good thing about Apple computers is that they tend  to hold their life well and unless you need the latest and greatest computer you can buy, <strong>an iMac should last you about 3 years or so</strong>. I’m writing this on a 2008 MacBook Pro that has paid  for itself over and over the past three years and for the work I do, I see no reason for an upgrade.</p>

<p>Assuming you get 3 years out of your iMac, which is quite possible and if you <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004R6J2KW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B004R6J2KW">add AppleCare for your iMac</a></strong> you’ve got a trouble free Mac desktop with full warranty, the 2.7 Ghz works out to costing $47.00 monthly, and the stock iMac 3.1 GHz works out a few dollars more at $55.00 – About eight dollars a month more.  $55 a month, and the  fastest iMac is paid  for. Less,  if you find a way to make more money with your computer. It’s quite possible to earn a living with your Mac, and as you see the <strong>price difference between the 2.7GHz and 3.1GHz Apple iMacs</strong>, when broken down over the three years is negligible.</p>

<p><strong>Adding more RAM to the iMac 3.1GHz</strong></p>

<p>[table id=2 /]</p>

<p>Out of the box, the Apple iMac 3.1 GHz comes from Apple shipped with just <strong>8GB of RAM</strong>, which for light computer use  like checking your email, or booking a vacation, or some other rather processor light task or if you just want  to use the included iApps like iTunes and iPhoto and the like, then the 8GB of factory supplied RAM will probably do you.</p>

<p>But if you’ve bought 2 grand worth of iMac to get the <strong>fastest iMac you can buy</strong> this year, you either need the added screen real estate a 27 inch iMac offers, or even more likely, you <strong>need the processor speed **and the cheapest way to upgrade your iMac processor is to add more memory to your Apple 3.1 GHz iMac. And as long as you  don’t **<a href="http://store.apple.com/us/memorymodel/ME_IMAC_S11_21">buy RAM from Apple</a></strong>, you can upgrade the iMac to the full 16GB of RAM for less than $100. Actually, as I write this in the summer of 2011, less than $70 for another 8GB of  iMac RAM is quite possible.</p>

<p>Once you’ve decided to buy more iMac RAM and fill the fastest iMac with as much RAM as possible, you need to buy another <strong>8GB of DDR3 1333Mhz SDRAM sodimms</strong>. There was once  a time when Apple computers were much more fussy about the memory requirements and  you needed to buy memory for specifically for Apple computers but for now those days are behind us and  as long as  you buy quality memory upgrades from memory stores you can trust, with the right memory specifications  you will have no problems when installing memory in this Apple computer or any other, either.</p>

<p><strong>How to Install iMac 3.1 GHz 27 inch  Memory  Upgrades</strong></p>

<p>Apple computer can show you to <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1423">install iMac RAM </a>much  better than I can, but essentially you need to place the  iMac face down on your desk (I suggest  a soft blanket  or towel so you don’t scratch that big beautiful lcd display)  and  remove the door to access the four iMac memory upgrade slots on the bottom of the iMac. There’s four slots available for memory upgrades, and two of them are going to be empty and just waiting for you to add two more <strong><a href="http://www.dpbolvw.net/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT51264BC1339">4GB DDR3 SDRAM 1333Mhz sodimms</a></strong>, or  if you prefer, an <strong><a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT2KIT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1339">8GB Apple iMac memory</a></strong> upgrade kit that bundles two 4GB DDR3 for iMac together.</p>

<p>One thing you do have to be careful about when installing memory upgrades is static electricity. If you wish to be real careful you can add an anti static strap to your memory order when <strong>buying  iMac RAM</strong> but it’s really not needed if you’re careful to ground yourself, which is done by touching metal on the iMac before you touch the memory upgrade for iMacs, as the static electricity  can damage your memory upgrade.</p>

<p>If you’e on a budget then <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004YKXGIK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B004YKXGIK">buy the cheapest iMac you can</a></strong> which, if you buy from Amazon or <a href="http://www.kqzyfj.com/click-1548159-10894596">MacMall</a>,you’ll save over what is available and on sale  at the Apple Store. And I’ve already explained that the <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/apple-imac-21-5-inch-2-7-ghz-memory-upgrades/" title="Apple iMac 21.5 inch 2.7 GHz Memory Upgrades">faster 21.5 inch iMac is better value long term</a></strong> but if it were me, and especially if  I made a living from the iMac, even part time – the difference in price between a 2.7Ghz 21.5 inch, and a 2.7GHz 27 inch is just $200 more. Over a year, <strong>that price difference works out to be just pennies a day</strong> – about .50 or a bit more.</p>

<p><strong>Bigger  Screen =  Faster iMac</strong></p>

<p>This is something that can get overlooked. I’m just recently back from a week away working with a borrowed MacBook Air, and as light and awesome as the MacBook Air, there’s something to be said for more screen real estate. With a <strong>bigger screen, you can have more windows open, and work more efficiently</strong>,  and if you’ve got the need for either lots of toolbars or browser windows open, a big screen on your iMac is worth way more than the pennies a day  more it costs when  compared to the faster, but smaller sized display on the Apple iMac 21.5 inch model</p>

<p><strong>iMac Intel Core i5 2.7GHz 27 inch Memory Upgrades</strong></p>

<p>Now that we’ve determined that when compared to the 21 inch iMacs, this particular iMac is the <strong>best deal across the entire iMac lineup</strong> I wan to talk about RAM upgrades. When you consider the cost of the iMac at $1699, and the cheapest RAM upgrade for the iMac hovers around $75 mark currently, you can get the <strong>fastest and biggest iMac on sale  if you shop carefully</strong>, get free ram for the iMac 27 inch too.</p>

<p>Let me explain:</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.apple.com/imac/specs.html">iMac 27 inch costs $1699 at the Apple Store</a>, and another 8GB of RAM at the Apple Store costs a whopping $400. <strong>Total cost for a 27 inch iMac full of RAM =$2099.00</strong></p>

<p>But if you <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004YLCBRG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B004YLCBRG">buy the 27 inch iMac at Amazon</a></strong>, you’ll save about $80 off the 1699.99 regular retail price. And the <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002YUF8ZG/ref=as_li_ss_til?tag=ramseeker-20&amp;camp=213381&amp;creative=390973&amp;linkCode=as4&amp;creativeASIN=B002YUF8ZG&amp;adid=1M72YM31597Z6H77GVMK&amp;">cheapest iMac RAM you can buy</a></strong> is also priced less than that discount , at about $75, so if you <strong>buy both the iMac and RAM at Amazon</strong> your total is still less than $1699, by about five dollars so the <strong>total cost to upgrade your new Apple iMac to the maximum 16GB RAM is essentially FREE</strong>. A ram upgrade that costs you nothing is the cheapest ram you’ll ever see.</p>

<p><strong>Where to Buy 27 inch Apple iMac RAM</strong></p>

<p>Of course my logic and math on getting <strong>iMac RAM for FREE</strong> only applies if you are ready to buy a new iMac today and apply the Amazon discount to the RAM Upgrades. If you already have a 27 inch Apple iMac and are <strong>considering a ram upgrade to the maximum of 16GB</strong> you can still do so, and still save enough money on RAM when compared to Apple to <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0039SM0AS/ref=as_li_ss_til?tag=ramseeker-20&amp;camp=213381&amp;creative=390973&amp;linkCode=as4&amp;creativeASIN=B0039SM0AS&amp;adid=1C309EX3ASWHZ876FEXY&amp;">buy yourself a SSD hard drive,</a></strong> which after memory upgrades might be the <strong>best performance enhancement for your Apple desktop computer</strong> as the solid  state hard drives are <strong>much faster than traditional hard  drives</strong> for Apple computer and offer much faster performance when you compare the two.</p>

<p>Below is a current price list of where to buy  RAM for the 2011 Apple iMacs, and as you can see the <strong>iMac ram prices are much cheaper</strong> than the RAM prices from Apple directly.</p>

<p>Let’s fast forward say, 3 years to 2014. <strong>8GB of iMac RAM **is laughable as all Macs now ship standard at 32GB as the minimum ram you can get installed in any Apple computer. But, if you bought this Apple iMac model over the cheaper one, filled your iMac with another 8GB and are now running at the maximum ram allowable for 2011 iMacs, you’re **now at 16GB of RAM</strong> and you can now forget about buying a new desktop for sometime as you now have <strong>16GB iMac RAM</strong>. Although when compared to 2014 computers this will seem like a paltry amount, the 16GB iMac has served you well for at least three years.</p>

<p>Assuming you pay full retail. (which you won’t, because you’re smart) and add another <strong>8GB of iMac RAM</strong> you’re now at 16GB and $1600 for your iMac. $1600/36 = $44 a month to use this iMac worry free for the next three years. For about the same price as a cheap cup of coffee a day you can <strong>buy this iMac, fill it with RAM</strong> and never have to worry about a new computer again.</p>

<p>I’ve done this with a MacBook Pro: I filled it with RAM and forgot about it. I use this 2008 MacBook Pro every day and only now, due to crummy battery life and some keyboard issues am I considering replacing my MacBook Pro with a new model. Again, I’ll research which mac to buy (or maybe even a PC, dare I say)  determine what computer best meets my needs  and then fill that mac with as much RAM as I can (assuming the RAM is affordable)</p>

<p>My point is this: At first glance, the <strong>cheapest iMac might be considered a better deal</strong> when you compare the iMac to more expensive iMacs. But if you decide you need a new iMac this particular iMac model might just be considered the <strong>cheapest iMac overall</strong> when you total the cost and consider that the 2.7GHz can take more RAM, and that RAM can be bought for as little as $100, or even much less.</p>

<p>I won’t write about all the wonderful features of the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/new-2011-apple-imac-models-announced/" title="New 2011 Apple iMac Models Announced">newest 2011 iMacs</a> as I’ve kindof done that already, but I did want to point out that this particular Apple iMac, due to the fact that it’s the cheapest 2011 iMac that can take 16GB, the 2.5Ghz might be the best of the bunch despite the fact that the initial cash outlay may be more initially.</p>
