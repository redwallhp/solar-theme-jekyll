<p>Hit the link for the download info, and what’s new in Ubuntu’s latest version:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2016/04/ubuntu-16-04-download-new-features">Ubuntu 16.04 LTS Is Now Available to Download</a></p>

  <p>It’s finally here: the stable Ubuntu 16.04 LTS release is now available to download.</p>

  <p>Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (‘Xenial Xerus’) is supported for 5 years with critical security, bug and app updates from Canonical, the company that makes Ubuntu.</p>

  <p>Every year, I put together a list of the changes I’d like to see in the next version of iOS. I’ve been doing this for several years now. This year, I wanted to prepare something bigger. The tenth version of iOS due to be released later this year will be a major milestone for Apple and iOS users. It only felt appropriate to celebrate the occasion with a different take on my annual iOS wish list.</p>
