		<div class="post-content">This was one of the biggest challenges when switching from Mac OS is that you could not decide where the launcher went as it was glued to the left hand side. Now it's just a terminal command away and Pc World shows us how:

> After six long years of requests from users, the Unity 7 desktop on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS just gained a long-awaited option: You can now move the launcher bar from the left side of the screen to the bottom. It requires a hidden terminal command, but it’s now an officially supported feature!

		<div class="post-content"> Dan Knight at Low End Mac makes [some interesting thoughts on speed](http://lowendmac.com/2016/iphone-history-small-steps-and-big-leaps) increases on iPhones as they have progressed:




> I think we’ve come to the end of the big forward leaps in processing power. We may see 3- and 4-core processors and higher clock speeds, but even then don’t expect to see a tripling – or even doubling – of performance from one iPhone generation to the next.


I think he's right. I have jumped from an iPhone 4s to 5 and an iPad Mini as the 3 apple iOS devices and to be honest - they all work great and the speed doesn't seem all that different to me. The reviews state the iPhone SE to be super fast, but when I quickly demoed one the other day at Best Buy, I came away unimpressed.

There used to be a day when speed mattered more. Now, I think it's battery life that does.

The onnly downside is it costs a few bucks, but there is a trial period to see if you like it as well.
