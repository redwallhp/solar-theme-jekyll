<p>Apple MacBook Pro Memory Upgrades for much less than Apple charges:</p>

<p>That’s what it costs for the <strong>Apple Store to add ram to your Mac **as not only will you have to **pay more for Apple memory</strong> than what you could buy elsewhere for even name brand RAM, which tends to be on the pricier side of things anyway such as <a href="http://www.kingston.com" title="kingston memory">Kingston Memory</a> or <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">Crucial memory,</a> but you also have to endure the inconvenience of physically taking your Mac to the Apple Store,  and maybe it’s just  my bad luck but in the few times I have been to an Apple Store, the stores have always been packed with  people which a great  thing for Apple, as they sell more <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002M3SO0G/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002M3SO0G">iPods</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002C74BNG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002C74BNG">iPads</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26node%3D172282%26ref_%3Dbl_sr_pc%26field-brandtextbin%3DApple&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">Apple Mac Computers</a> but for the Macintosh user who <strong>just wants more ram installed</strong>, regardless of what Mac you wish to upgrade and that’s to <strong>install the Apple RAM yourself</strong> and save money on memory upgrades in the process.</p>

<p>Let’s use a <strong>13 inch MacBook Pro</strong> as an example, as it currently is the <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/best-notebook-computers-of-2011/" title="best selling notebook">best selling notebook</a></strong> – regardless of computer manufacturer, so there’s definitely a market not only for this article, but for cheap and good MacBook Pro RAM overall that’s much cheaper than what Apple charges for RAM. As I write this to double the RAM on a new MacBook Pro will cost you $400 for 8GB of  13 inch MacBook Pro Memory.</p>

<p>[table id=15 /]</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW">Much Cheaper Apple Memory</a></strong></p>

<p> </p>

<p>Compare that to third party memory stores where you can buy the same <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_Pro_DDR3_1333Mhz_Memory_Upgrade_Kits-8gb/">8GB MacBook Pro Memory</a></strong> for under $100.  I don’t know about you but I sure don’t have an extra $300 to spend for the priveledge of <strong>buying ram from Apple</strong> when I can buy pretty much the same memory for less, much less. <strong>75% savings off $400 for MacBook Pro RAM</strong> is nothing to sneeze at, and if I do feel the need to give Apple more money I can do so with the purchase of an <strong>iPod</strong> or even use the savings on Apple RAM towards an <strong>Apple iPad</strong>.</p>

<p>To be fair, the <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/cheapest-apple-macbook-pro-memory-upgrades/">cheapest RAM for MacBook Pros</a></strong>are going to come as <strong>generic RAM,</strong> And although  it’s not specified there’s a very good chance your new MacBook Pro will ship with name brand memory upgrades.  The last MacBook I bought had <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">Micron RAM </a></strong>installed at default, which even though it’s name brand still only  has a street price of about $100 or perhaps a bit over. You’ll be fine with RAM from third party memory stores that are established online RAM vendors who sell a <strong>quality generic RAM product</strong>.</p>

<p>Now the best part. You can <strong>install RAM yourself</strong> for any current and discontinued Mac and in the case of the current Macs adding RAM upgrades yourself will not void your Apple limited warranty and <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/cheapest-apple-macbook-pro-memory-upgrades/">Apple even provides memory upgrade instructions</a> that will help you with the task of a memory install yourself.</p>

<p>I see no reason to either buy RAM from Apple either online, or direct as the cost is very high compared to much <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW">cheaper Apple Memory upgrade options</a></strong></p>
