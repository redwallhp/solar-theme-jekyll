<p>Oddly enough, if you’re in the market to buy a a new MacBook, if  you want to get a good deal on a MacBook you can do much better on  the price if you <strong>do not buy  the MacBook from  Apple</strong> and  <strong>buy a MacBook from Amazon</strong> instead. When you buy the MacBook at the Apple Store you get to pay full list price for your MacBook, and in the age of the internet where **deals on Apple Macs **are just  a click away, why would you buy  a Mac from Apple when you can buy it less than the $999 MSRP somewhere else</p>

<p> </p>

<p>I like Amazon when <strong>buying Apple products</strong> as they offer bundles and special offers on not only your MacBook  but Mac accessories like Apple Displays, Mice, external keyboards and even <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/">MacBook RAM upgrades</a>.<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1600" title="Cheapest MacBook " src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-30-at-5.31.00-PM.png" alt="Best Price MacBook" width="303" height="243" /></p>

<p>At the time I write this, Amazon offers a **MacBook Bundle **that consists of the MacBook at a discount, but also Microsoft Office and AppleCare for your Macbook is also offered at a much cheaper price than had you bought the MacBook Pro.</p>

<p>Apple does offer refurbished MacBooks for less than what you would pay for a new MacBook, but you are not  buying a new MacBook but pre-owned MacBook or refurb, which might be a better price than a new MacBook, you might be buying problems rather than a deal, whereas if you stick with a new MacBook that’s priced well under the $999 MSRP from Apple you deal with what is probably one of the better vendors online regardless of what manufacturer you want, not just Apple.</p>

<p>Of course, when it comes time to get the <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_(1066_DDR3)/">best price on RAM for your new Apple MacBook</a></strong> you’re already at the right place, and I can recommend many memory sellers that can offer deals on Apple RAM too.</p>
