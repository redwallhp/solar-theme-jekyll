	<div class="post-content"><p><strong>4GB of RAM has never been cheaper than it is today</strong></p>

<p>The price on memory upgrades, or RAM if  you will changes constantly so rather then tell you what it costs for 4GB of RAM I’d rather show you with a price list of current ram prices for notebook computers. I chose notebooks, because there’s a good chance your next computer will be a notebook computer because the prices on notebook computers keep dropping in price over time.</p>

<p>An example: One of the best selling notebooks currently on sale at Amazon (I like buying my computers from Amazon, they offer quick shipping, and stock everything under the sun so I can place one order and then get on with life.  I don’t have to shop at different computer stores  – one for RAM, and one for the laptop)</p>

<p>Anyway, as an example, you can get into an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005NRNPCK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B005NRNPCK">Asus netbook for about $350</a>, which is  a pretty good deal for a notebook for web browsing and facebooking and  the like. And this particular Asus notebook  allows up to 8GB of RAM, meaning you’ll need to buy 4GB x 2 to fill the two available memory slots this notebook computer has.</p>

<p>Not only is this a pretty good deal on a notebook for under $400, but  also if you add RAM you’ll get a speed increase too Take a look at the  8GB Memory Upgrade Kits for this laptop computer:</p>

<p> </p>

<p>[table id=7 /]</p>

<p>As you can see, 4GB memory modules for 2011 notebooks are pretty cheap, and the 8GB memory upgrade kits save you more money on RAM as they are discounted usually as a memory upgrade kit, as opposed to a memory upgrade module.</p>

<p>If you have been sitting on the fence about a ram upgrade, now is  the best time to buy. In the fifteen years I have been keeping  track of the memory prices, ram has never ever been cheaper. Buy 4GB RAM now and be happy that you saved money and have a smoother and faster computer to boot.</p>
