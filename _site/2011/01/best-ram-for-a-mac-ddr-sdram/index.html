	<div class="post-content"><p>When shopping for the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="best mac ram upgrades">best Mac RAM upgrades</a>, regardless of what specific Mac computer you have there’s a very good chance you will be shopping for DDR SDRAM, as this specific memory upgrade type has been in circulation for close to a decade, if not longer.</p>

<p>Today’s popular <strong>DDR SDRAM Memory Upgrades</strong> for Mac all tend to be  from the DDR3 family running at speeds of up to 1333Mhz and with capacities of 8GB in size for each DDR3 memory upgrade chip which for upgrading an Apple Mac computer in 2011 means you could, if you have very deep pockets – install up to 64GB of RAM in an Apple Mac Pro.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Even though the DDR3 1333Mhz specification did not start to come onto the scene for Apple Memory Upgrades until the release of the 2010 iMac and Mac Pro models about halfway through the year, in the short time that they have been available, and especially when it comes to the larger Mac Pro Memory Upgrade Kits consisting of memory kits based on 8GB DDR3 1333Mhz memory modules, the prices have dropped at very least 30% in the past six months or so on DDR3 1333Mhz memory upgrades. Regardless of the DDR ram specification,  ram prices continue to drop over time. If you wait, you get a better deal on ram than if you are an early adopter and buy ram when the new DDR3 ram is used and recognized by Apple computers.</p>

<p>The other specification for Apple DDR3 SDRAM is the 1066Mhz speed, which obviously does not run as fast as the 1333Mhz RAM. With other speeds of DDR RAM, you might be able to get away with buying the faster of the two memory upgrade speeds and the ram would gear down to the lower DDR MHz speed if need be. But this is not the case with the DDR3 1066 and DDR3 1333MHz. You cannot interchange the memory for your Mac. If your Apple requires the faster DDR3 RAM, you need to buy the right DDR SDRAM for your Apple Computer Model.</p>

<p>To make things a bit easier for you to determine what RAM you need, here are the current ram prices for currently shipping Apple computer models:</p>
