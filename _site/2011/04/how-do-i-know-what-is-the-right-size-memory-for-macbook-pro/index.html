<p><strong>Your Mac Will Tell You What Memory You Need.</strong></p>

<p>But, all joking aside it’s pretty easy to figure out what memory you need for your 2010 MacBook Pro (or any Apple computer, now that I think of it).You could always <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/contact">ask me</a>. <img src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p>In the top left corner of your Apple MacBook 2010 is a little Apple logo, that if you click it you will see a menu item called <strong>About This Mac</strong>. It’s the very first menu item you see when you select the Apple Menu, so it’s pretty easy to find. After you have selected the menu, up pops a window that looks similar to this:<br />
<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1713" title="Apple Menu " src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Screen-shot-2011-04-14-at-3.08.10-PM.png" alt="How to Find Mac Memory" width="311" height="385" /></a></p>

<p>On this menu, you will see that it will tell you what version of the Mac OS you are running,  what your processor speed is and how much and what type of speed memory you have already installed in your MacBook Pro. In my  case, I already have the maximum macbook memory installed as I’m typing this on  a 2008 MacBook Pro, and at the time, 4GB of RAM was a lot of memory (how times change)</p>

<p>The more info button will bring up the system profiler which will tell you that you’ve got two memory upgade chips installed and some other technical jargon that, in my opinion you don’t need – as you now have all the data you need – you know your MacBook Pro processor speed, memory type and speed and how much ram you already have installed.</p>

<p>Now all you need is to find a memory store that will help you find the right ram for your MacBook Pro. I’ve got a <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/where-to-buy-computer-memory-upgrades/" title="memory store list">great list of memory stores</a> here but for this example I will use <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">crucial technology</a></strong> as they offer fair prices on ram and  have an easy to use memory upgrade finder.</p>

<p>Off we go to <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">Crucial</a></strong>, where we select our Computer Manufacturer, Model Name, and processor speed  – all things your Mac already told you you have, and  you’re returned with information about your particular model such as memory type for your MacBook Pro (which we already know) and how many slots  and the maximum RAM your MacBook Pro can recognize, stuff we didn’t know.</p>

<p>If my MacBook Pro only had 2GB of RAM installed, I now know that I could max out my RAM on my MacBook Pro by replacing the 2x1GB memory upgrades with bigger memory modules, and  in this example that would be two 2GB memory modules for MacBook Pro which would maximize the RAM in my particular Apple MacBook Pro.</p>

<p>And once you have bought your MacBook Pro RAM Upgrade, it’s easy to install the MacBook memory yourself with common household tools that will not void your warranty. You can find how to upgrade your Apple RAM from Apple as <strong><a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1270" title="how to install apple ram">Macbook Pro Memory Upgrade instructions</a></strong> are included in the manual that came with your MacBook Pro.</p>

<p>It’s that easy to find the right memory for your MacBook Pro.</p>
