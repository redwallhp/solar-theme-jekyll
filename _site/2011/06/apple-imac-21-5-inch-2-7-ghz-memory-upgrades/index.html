	<div class="post-content"><p>Unlike the <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004YKXGIK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B004YKXGIK">cheapy iMac</a></strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004YKXGIK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B004YKXGIK">,</a> when you cough up another $300 to $1499.00 (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004YL2KBS/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B004YL2KBS">you can get this iMac cheaper</a>) you get to add 16GB of iMac RAM to this and every iMac from hereon in as the get more expensive with more features down the Apple iMac lineup.When compared to the <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004YKXGIK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B004YKXGIK">cheapest iMac in 2011</a></strong> that comes out of Apple, <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004YL2KBS/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B004YL2KBS">the 21.5 inch 2.7Ghz processor iMac</a></strong> is priced $300 higher, adds a bit more hard drive space, faster graphics card and that’s about it for differences when you <strong>compare the Apple iMac 2.5Gz to the Apple iMac 2.7Ghz</strong>, except one thing that’s pretty important and might long term help you squeeze more life out of your 2011 Apple iMac and that’s the fact that the <strong>21.5 inch 2.7Ghz iMac can accept more ram</strong> than its’ 2.5GHz counterpart.</p>

<p>Let’s fast forward say, 3 years to 2014. <strong>8GB of iMac RAM **is laughable as all Macs now ship standard at 32GB as the minimum ram you can get installed in any Apple computer. But, if you bought this Apple iMac model over the cheaper one, filled your iMac with another 8GB and are now running at the maximum ram allowable for 2011 iMacs, you’re **now at 16GB of RAM</strong> and you can now forget about buying a new desktop for sometime as you now have <strong>16GB iMac RAM</strong>. Although when compared to 2014 computers this will seem like a paltry amount, the 16GB iMac has served you well for at least three years.</p>

<p>Assuming you pay full retail. (which you won’t, because you’re smart) and add another <strong>8GB of iMac RAM</strong> you’re now at 16GB and $1600 for your iMac. $1600/36 = $44 a month to use this iMac worry free for the next three years. For about the same price as a cheap cup of coffee a day you can <strong>buy this iMac, fill it with RAM</strong> and never have to worry about a new computer again.</p>

<p>I’ve done this with a MacBook Pro: I filled it with RAM and forgot about it. I use this 2008 MacBook Pro every day and only now, due to crummy battery life and some keyboard issues am I considering replacing my MacBook Pro with a new model. Again, I’ll research which mac to buy (or maybe even a PC, dare I say)  determine what computer best meets my needs  and then fill that mac with as much RAM as I can (assuming the RAM is affordable)</p>

<p>My point is this: At first glance, the <strong>cheapest iMac might be considered a better deal</strong> when you compare the iMac to more expensive iMacs. But if you decide you need a new iMac this particular iMac model might just be considered the <strong>cheapest iMac overall</strong> when you total the cost and consider that the 2.7GHz can take more RAM, and that RAM can be bought for as little as $100, or even much less.</p>

<p>I won’t write about all the wonderful features of the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/new-2011-apple-imac-models-announced/" title="New 2011 Apple iMac Models Announced">newest 2011 iMacs</a> as I’ve kindof done that already, but I did want to point out that this particular Apple iMac, due to the fact that it’s the cheapest 2011 iMac that can take 16GB, the 2.5Ghz might be the best of the bunch despite the fact that the initial cash outlay may be more initially.</p>
