	<div class="post-content"><p><strong>8GB Memory is the <a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT2KIT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1339">most affordable and most popular</a> computer memory upgrade today</strong></p>

<p>The answer to this question changes over the years, and ten years ago 1GB of RAM seemed like an unthinkable  amount of  computer ram to have installed and the price was just as unthinkable with it not uncommon to see RAM upgrades for 1GB  sell for one thousand dollars or more, but in 2011 not only have the memory modules gotten bigger over time, they have also gotten cheaper over time too, which means you spend  less money for more RAM upgrades now than ever before.</p>

<p>The good news for  most computer users is that  <strong>today’s computers ship with enough RAM</strong> to run the installed applications such as Windows 7 or Mac OSX and usually a web browser or two and for some every day computer users who just need to check the  weather and browse facebook then the factory  installed RAM is more than ample of an upgrade as we get closer and  closer to location free computing thanks to being able to work in the cloud.</p>

<p>But for the rest of us who like to get some work done, or play games  or edit videos  – the more RAM you have , the better. <strong>There’s no such thing as having too much RAM.</strong></p>

<p>Out of the box, notebook computers, probably the best selling computer today ship from the factory with 3 or 4GB of RAM already installed but  <strong>most notebooks today can use up to 8GB  of RAM</strong> with a few high powered graphics or business notebooks being able to accept 16GB of RAM, but the average and best selling ram upgrade is th<strong>e <a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT2KIT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1339">8GB DDR3 SDRAM memory upgrade kit</a></strong>.</p>

<p><strong>8GB of RAM for desktop or notebooks in 2011</strong> is the current sweet spot for memory upgrades. 4GB ram, while cheaper than 8GB obviously doesn’t double the RAM in your computer which is what you’re trying to do when you’re ready to buy RAM and 16GB RAM isn’t priced affordably enough yet to make the cost worthwhile for all but a few power users or early adapters to the bigger 8GB memory sodimms that are required as most notebooks can’t hold more than two memory upgrade modules at  a time.</p>

<p><strong>8GB Memory Prices</strong></p>

<p><strong>8GB DDR3 sodimms</strong> are the best selling and  most popular memory upgrade to date for computers, especially notebook and laptop computers</p>
