		<h1><a href="/2011/11/what-is-the-verizon-customer-service-number/">What is the Verizon Customer Service Number?</a></h1>
	

	<div class="post-content"><p>I am moving to the USA soon and in preparation for this we (my fiance and  I) have started  to consider a Verizon family plan, as this plan will allow me to use my Verizon phone in Canada as long as I stay away from data usage, as the costs for using data with Verizon in Canada is one cost I prefer not to have.</p>

<p>She orders the phones, and what should have been a simple transaction  – we buy the verizon phones, and she may have to call Verizon  to get her old Verizon phone number and all I would have to do would be to actiivate my phone, and then have her bring it to me in Canada.</p>

<p>But, Verizon  screwed  this up big time. Apparently it was our fault too, but she just ordered the phone, plan and then thought all would be good. Nope.</p>

<p>She had to call Verizon to get this all straightened out but the first question we had to answer was whom to call at Verizon?</p>

<p><strong>Verizon Contact and Customer Service Numbers</strong></p>

<p>There a lot of ways to<a href="http://www.verizonwireless.com/b2c/contact/index.jsp"> Contact Verizon</a>, email – self serve options, faqs so you don’t even have to call them at all and  you can resolve your own issues, but in our case we had to** Call Verizon at (800) 922-0204** and even though we had to jump through some hoops to make it all work, we did.</p>

<p>We had to get transferred at Verizon customer support to speak to a more advanced customer service than the poor souls on the front line but we did get it all worked out, but it was a comedy of errors. The phones she ordered arrived, but in the meantime we found that we had to ship one back for her to keep her old phone number with Verizon.</p>

<p>Then, as these were newer and popular phones at the time her replacement phone was backordered so we had  to wait. Later when her phone finally did show up, so did another as somehow Verizon managed to ship her two phones – one to her work and one to her home address and after we finally got that sorted out then we were finally able to stop having to contact Verizon to fix our mess and thankfully we have not had to contact Verizon since.</p>
