		<h1><a href="/2011/11/where-to-find-hotmail-messenger-download/">Where To Find HotMail Messenger Download</a></h1>
	

	<div class="post-content"><p>As I wrote about earlier, I’m not much of a fan of  hotmail products and prefer to use the Google products instead such as Gmial and even Skype for chatting as I can make phone calls too, but with very big market using the Windows OS I want to take a moment and explore the Hotmail Messenger for 2011 as its’ been some time since I’ve had an opportunity to do so.</p>

<p><strong>HotMail Messenger is actually MSN Messenger</strong></p>

<p>I missed this news, but it seems to me that somewhere along the line hotmail got sold to microsoft so now there really is no hotmail messenger software you can download but you need to download MSN messenger instead, which is probably a big plus for users as the MSN brand is much much bigger than hotmail will be in 2011.</p>

<p>MSN Hotmail Messenger pretty much changes the game and you can choose to downoload MSN messenger or if you prefer, use skype. I use skype because the people I choose to connect with also us this software so I don’t  really  have much of  a need for MSN messenger.</p>

<p>But, you can never learn too much about any subject I find so let’s have a look at MSN messenger and have a look at the main features it provides. One thing I have found is that MSN messenger for windows is leaps and bounds better than MSN messenger for Mac with the windows version offering the features I wanted and  needed, but on the Mac, not so much.</p>

<p>The folks at microsoft offer a 40% discount on a high definition video camera that allows you to make HD video calls. You may want to also check Amazon for web cameras as I have found they offer the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;ref_=nb_sb_ss_sc_0_7&amp;field-keywords=hd%20webcam&amp;url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;sprefix=hd%20web%20&amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">best prices on HD web cameras</a> too.</p>

<p>You can also connect your MSN messenger  account with your facebook account too so you can chat with your facebook friends by using MSN messenger instead of using the facebook chat feature.</p>

<p>Windows Phones come with with MSN messenger pre-installed of course, so you can use your smartphone to chat with friends and  family too, and if you have an android smartphone you can download and install a MSN messenger chat. It should come as no surprise that there’s no  Apple iPhone MSN messenger app available on the MSN site, at least officially that I am aware of.</p>

<p>Overall, the <a href="http://explore.live.com/messenger">MSN messenger download</a> looks like a great way to connect with friends and family in 2011.</p>
