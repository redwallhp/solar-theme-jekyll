	<div class="post-content"><p>Guess what 123 inkjets sells? You got it  – Printer Ink and Toner! and according to them you can <a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-1548159-10471664">save up to 76 percent on ink and toners supplies</a> compared to what you would pay for the name brand inkjet refills, which can be sometimes worth more than the printer they were designed for.</p>

<p>I have never had good luck with printers,  and the more I think of it the more frustrated I get. Ink for your printer is kindof like gas for the car. If you don’t have ink the printer won’t run  and if you’re like me you wait until the last second to get new ink for your printer and you end up paying full retail price.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>With Age, Comes Wisdom</strong></p>

<p>But, the older  I get the more I begin to value preventive more than reactive when it comes to solving problems and the one problem you can solve quite easily is to be sure you’ve got enough ink ahead of time. But who want’s to pay full load for printer ink so you can stick it in the drawer? You’re much better off to be prepared and one way for that to happen and  save money on printer ink is to buy your ink ahead of time – whether you’re in charge of and entire offices’ full of office supplies or, like yours truly you just work out of a small office this advice still holds true.</p>

  <span style="color: #0000ee;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br /> </span></span><strong>How much can you save on printer ink? </strong>My little epson inkjet is one of the first printers I have had that actually does what it&#8217;s supposed to do and just print and copy when you need it. It&#8217;s a good little printer. But to buy ink directly from Epson will cost me about $38.00 and yet if I buy the compatible ink from 123 inkjets I&#8217;ll spend more in initial outlay, but I get 14 ink jet cartridges for just $79.00. That&#8217;s double  the savings and I never have to worry about ink for my printer for some time. I&#8217;m not a heavy printer user so I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if I got a year or more out of my printer ink purchase.
