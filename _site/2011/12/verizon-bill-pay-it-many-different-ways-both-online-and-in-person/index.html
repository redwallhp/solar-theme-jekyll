	<div class="post-content"><p>After all the feedback recently after verizon decided to charge their customers to pay their bills ( and then rescinded after all the feedback was rightfully negative for this idea) I realized that I had no idea on how to pay my verizon bill and not get charged a fee for giving Verizon my hard earned money and with this, it all changes as if there’s on priority I wan to make it’s better money management.</p>

<h2 id="verizon-bill-payment-options">Verizon Bill Payment Options</h2>

<p>In the interest of full disclosure, my soon to be wife takes care of all the Verizon bill payments in our family, and I am pretty sure she sends payment  via <a href="http://myverizon.com/billpay">bill payment online</a>, but there are other options to make sure  your Verizon bill is paid on time and without penalty.</p>

<p><a href="http://myverizon.com/billview"><strong>View Your Verizon Bill Online</strong></a></p>

<p>One of the first things you are going  to need to do if you want to pay your Verizon bill – regardless of how you end up paying it is to be able to view your  bill online. I am only  a Verizon wireless customer so far, but I know I can not only view my bill with verizon anytime, but at the end of the month I get a paper bill that’s sometimes many many pages long in the mail.</p>

<p><strong>Pay Your Verizon Bill Online</strong></p>

<p>Paying your Verizon Bill online is probably one of the easiest when it comes to methods to get your Verizon account  taken care of . All you have to do is Sign in at My Verizon and click on Account and then Payment and Payment Options to pay Verizon Online</p>

<p><strong>Paying your Verizon Bill By Mail</strong></p>

<p>Verizon will accept your bill payment via check. All you do is send your  payment to Verizon at the address on your Verizon bill. Be sure to include a stamp and send the correct amount so you don’t get charged late payment fees.</p>

<p><strong>Pay Verizon in Person</strong></p>

<p>You can also visit one of many many Verizon outlets and make a payment in person with cash, credit or debit card. All of these methods are acceptable to Verizon.</p>

<p>As you can see, there all lots of ways to get your Verizon Bill paid in time so you continue to use their services and your Verizon account will remain in good standing.</p>
