	<div class="post-content"><p><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Screen-Shot-2011-12-06-at-1.41.25-PM.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-3603 alignleft" title="15 inch MacBook Pro Deal" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Screen-Shot-2011-12-06-at-1.41.25-PM.png" alt="Apple MacBook Pro Deal" width="298" height="293" /></a></p>

<p>I keep on seeing ads for this software everywhere  I turn, so I guess it’s about time I had a closer look to see what all the fuss is about. <strong><a href="http://mackeeper.zeobit.com/">MacKeeper</a></strong>, as they call it – is 911 for you Mac, and the main features of this software for Apple computers –  both desktop and  notebooks –  is to keep your Mac running healthy and happy.</p>

<p><strong>Antivirus and Anti Theft Protection</strong></p>

<p>I’ve been running without antivirus protection on all my Apple computers for years, but they do happen and MacKeeper tends to be  offer protection against all security threats – not just viruses, but also identity theft, phishing attacks, unsafe downloads, email viruses and Mac Spyware and Mac malware is also blocked with MacKeeper.</p>

<p>The anti-theft feature won’t stop somebody from stealing your Mac, but it can help you identify the thief by reporting on the location of your stolen Mac and  even taking a picture of the thief by using the built in web camera.</p>

<p><strong>Robust Data Control</strong></p>

<p>Your data is probably the most important thing to you and usually has much more value than even the computer itself, and MacKeeper offer four components to keep your data safe:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The data encrypter hides your important files and those wishing to view those files need a password to do so.</li>
  <li>Backups are so important. Your <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/how-to-contact-western-digital-support/" title="How To Contact Western Digital Support">hard drive could fail at any time</a> and you’d be left without a thing when your hard drive crashes. Don’t let this happen to you and use the MacKeeper backup component to make copies of your stuff on external hard drives, via FTP , USB drive or ZeoDisk.</li>
  <li> File recovery lets you preview and recover deleted files. I know I have been trigger happy at times with the trash and would love to have had this tool in my arsenal.</li>
  <li>The shredder deletes files and folders you no longer need forever.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Cleaning and Maintenance </strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Duplicates Finder removes, wait for it  – duplicate files. It costs money and space to keep two or more of every file.</li>
  <li>Fast Clean removes all the junk  on your Mac that accumulates over time</li>
  <li>Smart Installer is a much better method to remove applications on your Ma ensuring there’s no files and clutter and hidden files left behind.</li>
  <li>File finder allows you to quickly find the file you’re looking for with ease.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Optimization</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Updates happen automatically with the included Update Tracker software. Each version of software on your Mac is checked to be sure you are running the latest software.</li>
  <li>Login Items allow you to start some applications automatically which results in more time for you and less time  waiting for applications to load.</li>
  <li>Default Apps is a great way to choose an application to open a file with.</li>
</ol>
