<p>Installing Memory in a MacBook Pro (or macbook) is pretty easy and can be don by the average computer user without any special tools or know-how.</p>

<p>First, you need to buy new macbook pro RAM  to install (see current prices on MacBook Pro Memory above) and replace the standard MacBook Pro memory that came installed with your computer in the first place. **Add as much macbook pro ram as you can afford. **You can never never go wrong when shopping for macbook pro ram when you buy ram from my list of authorized <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="macbook pro stores">macbook pro stores</a>. Brand can matter for some people when it comes to shopping for MacBook Pro RAM as there’s a small chance that the brand name stuff will work a bit better  in your MacBook Pro as usually it’s been tested and guaranteed to work. Generic MacBook Pro RAM works just fine too but you might be buying a wee bit more peace of mind when you buy the name brand ram. The cheapest RAM may or may not be the the best price on MacBook Pro RAM.</p>

<p>Once you have the RAM in your hand, you might want to invest in an anti-static wrist band. Sometimes you can buy the anti-static wrist band at the same time as you buy the MacBook Pro RAM, but  sometimes you’ll have to go elsewhere to buy an antistatic wrist band for installing memory. Your local computer store can usually help you.</p>

<p>You don’t NEED an antistatic wrist band if you’re sure to discharge any static electricity you have on you by touching  the metal casing of  your macbook pro first to discharge any static before you install the macbook pro ram. Also, it’s probably not a good idea to wear wool sweaters on a dry winter day or rub balloons on your head just before you install the macbook pro memory.  Be sure to discharge any static electricity before you go about installing RAM yourself. RAM is very particular and can be damaged by static electricity. When you bought it, you should have received it in an anti-static bag and sometimes there’s a big warning sticker on the bag that you have to break before you can access the ram and it says the same thing I’ve been saying: <strong>static electricity is bad for ram</strong></p>

<p>Once you’re all set to go then all you do is  remove the battery of your macbook pro, take  of the bottom part, or sometimes even then entire bottom. You might need a very small philips screwdriver or sometimes a specific torx screwdriver to do this. On my MacBook Pro, to add more ram once I had the cover off, I had to unplug and remove the MacBook Pro hard drive before I could access the RAM slots.</p>

<p>Once there, there’s two slots for MacBook Pro RAM and to remove the old MacBook Pro memory there’s two tabs that hold down the ram and when I did this the memory popped up to a 45 degree angle  which allowed me take hold of the memory (watch that static!) and with a slight pull I removed the memory. I did the same thing when removing the ram from the second memory slot and in no time I was ready to install my new MacBook Pro RAM.</p>

<p>For the actual installation of memory on my MacBook Pro all I did was the reverse. You slip the memory in at about a 45 degree angle into the slots and seat the memory into the slot. It’s a tight fit sometimes so don’t be afraid to use some gentle pressure. Push down on the RAM once it’s seated and the two little tabs click in to lock the memory down into the macbook pro’s memory slots. Repeat for the second memory slot in the MacBook Pro and you can’t go wrong really. The RAM has a little notch in it so you can’t install the memory backwards or upside down. The RAM only fits into the slot one way.</p>

<p>When you have your MacBook Pro ram installed,  all you do is replace what you removed to get at the memory upgrades slots. replace the hard drive, screw the cover or bottom of the MacBook Pro back on and replace the MacBook Pro Battery.  Press the power button and your MacBook Pro should start up without any trouble and now the MacBook Pro will run faster too and allow you to get your work done quicker.</p>

<p>Apple has excellent instructions on <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="how to install macbook pro ram">how to install MacBook Pro RAM </a> and you can find them by <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1270" title="install macbook pro ram">clicking here</a>. They’ve got instructions for a whole range of MacBook Pros so I suggest you refer to their instructions before installing MacBook Pro memory on your own.</p>
