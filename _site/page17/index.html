		<div class="post-content"><p>I’m not sure why you would want to do this but there’s software that  will allow to turn certain older Macs (and PC’s) into Chromebooks. <a href="http://neveware.com">Neverware</a> is <strong>free for individuals</strong> or you can pay a monthly fee for eductators with more support.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>CloudReady only runs one thing: a browser. This makes for a bloat-proof and lightweight OS that can keep machines up to 8 years old fast and responsive.</p>

  <p>You don’t need to get a new machine to experience a market-leading OS or get reliable performance. CloudReady works on the computers you already have and lets cloud-services do the heavy lifting.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not all Macs or PCs are supported, but a good number are.  One thing I did notice  is all the Macs they support will still run OSX El Capitan which gives you <strong>a lot more features </strong>than Chrome OS does but I’m going to guess this OS runs much faster on your old Mac.

    <h1><a href="/2015/06/how-much-does-it-cost-to-finance-a-mac/">How Much Does it Cost to Finance a Mac?</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>One way to buy a new Apple computer is to finance it and pay for it over time. If you’re a business you can usually write off the payment as an expense (see your accountant) or if your Apple computer is for personal use, financing your Mac makes the cost <strong>more</strong> affordable because you can pay for it over time.</p>

<p>Here’s a few ways you can make monthly payments on your Mac:</p>

<h2 id="apple-financing">Apple Financing</h2>

<p>The easiest way to buy an Apple computer is to buy it directly from Apple and then make the monthly payments through the <a href="http://store.apple.com/us/payment_plan">Apple Payment Plan</a> that offers two ways you can pay for your new mac:</p>

<h3 id="paypal-credit-monthly-payment-plan">Paypal Credit Monthly Payment Plan</h3>

<p>The PayPal credit monthly payment plan offers regular monthly payments, a 12.99% APR, and the option to select 6,12,18 or 24 month terms. This is the plan you see at the Apple Store for payments based on 24 months:</p>

<h3 id="barclay-visa-financing">Barclay Visa Financing</h3>

<p>Using the Barclay Visa Card you can get financing on your new Mac for up to 18 months and get no interest if you pay it off in full during the promo period. You get six months to pay for purchases under $498.00, 12 months for under $998 and 18 months for any purchase $999 or over (not hard to do if you’re buying any mac other than the Mac Mini)</p>

<p>Which one is better? If you know you can pay off the Mac <strong>before</strong> the promo period is over then the Barclay Visa plan is the way to go because you <strong>pay no interest</strong> on you purchase.</p>

<p>But if you just want a fixed payment plan over the course of 24 months with the smallest and cheapest monthly payment then the Payal plan is the way to go.</p>

<h2 id="ebay-financing">eBay Financing</h2>

<p>eBay of course uses <a href="https://www.paypalcredit.com/index.html">Paypal Credit</a> for their financing and offers the option to make no payments for 6 months. You will still get monthly invoices and you can still make payments at any time to pay it off early too. If you know you can pay off your Mac in six months or less then Paypal Credit is the way to go when shopping for a Mac on eBay.</p>

<h2 id="mac-mall-financing">Mac Mall Financing</h2>

<p>MacMall also uses Paypal Credit for financing so all the terms that apply to eBay are the same that are used when you buy a Mac from Mac Mall.</p>

<h2 id="amazon-financing">Amazon Financing</h2>

<p>Amazon offers two types of financing. The first is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/iss/credit/storecardmember/ref=footer_plcc?_encoding=UTF8&amp;plattr=PLCCFOOT">Amazon Store Card</a> that offers promotional financing with 6, 12 or 24 month terms.</p>

<p>The Amazon Rewards Visa is the card that Amazon promotes the most and offers $50.00 off instantly on any purchase and you also get 3% back when you buy from Amazon. If you’re buying a $30.00 Apple computer then that’s not too bad a deal.</p>

<h2 id="best-buy-financing">Best Buy Financing</h2>

<p>Best Buy Credit offers financing for 12 months on purchases $399.99 and up and they offer a 12 month no interest rate if you pay off your Mac in 12 month or less</p>

<h2 id="what-is-the-best-way-to-finance-an-apple-computer">What is the Best Way to Finance an Apple Computer?</h2>

<p>Of course, this depends on what you are comfortable with and where you buy your Mac.</p>

<h4 id="apple">Apple</h4>

<p>The Apple Store offers the fixed finance rates over time so you will know you’re paying interest but you will also know what the payment will be and most payments will be about $50.00 or so a month for popular devices like the MacBook Air or MacBook Pro.</p>

<p>If you know you can pay off the Mac in 18 months or less and don’t want to pay interest then buying your Mac from Apple through the Barclay Visa plan is a good idea too.</p>

<h4 id="ebay">eBay</h4>

<p>Deals on Mac computers can be sometimes be had on eBay especially when it comes to older stock or refurbished items. If you can pay it off in six months using the PayPal credit plan then this is another option.</p>

<h4 id="amazon">Amazon</h4>

<p>Amazon offers that 3% discount but you will pay interest from day one. Unless you find a great deal on a Mac I would buy from somewhere else that charges no interest</p>

<h4 id="best-buy">Best Buy</h4>

<p>Buying a Mac at Best Buy can be a pretty good deal. It’s quite common for Best buy to have sales on new Macs that beat any price you can get a Mac from Apple or Amazon. It’s not uncommon to see a $100 discount on new Apple computers. And if you can pay off the full purchase price in 12 months then using the Best Buy credit card isn’t that bad of an idea.</p>

<p>Personally, if I was going to finance a Mac I would just do so from the Apple Store directly and make the monthly payments via PayPal credit over the term I selected. A new Apple computer will still be fully usable in 2 years and even though you do pay some interest over the term I think it’s worth it to know exactly what your payments will be.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2015/06/what-is-the-best-macbook-for-2015/">What is the Best MacBook for 2015?</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>With the release of the retina MacBook in March 2015 as Apple’s lightest and thinnest Mac to date there are now three different notebook computers to choose from and the choices are not easy and there are pros and cons to each model but first, let’s look at what’s available</p>

<p>1.6GHz Intel Core i5 processor with turbo boost to 2.7GHz and 4GB of RAM with a 256GB SSD drive.</p>

<h2 id="what-macbook-to-choose">What MacBook To Choose?</h2>

<p>I count 12 different Apple notebooks to choose from, and that’s not including if you buy from the Apple Store and start to customize your order where there’s even more options. But for the case of this article I want to compare the stock models because there’s a good chance this is what you would buy off the shelf.</p>

<h3 id="inch-macbook-vs-11-inch-macbook-air">12 inch MacBook vs 11 inch MacBook Air</h3>

<p>The retina MacBook is Apple’s latest model and as such is also the thinnest Apple notebook you an buy today but it offers some disadvantages over the other models and the very first is the lack of ports as there are just two for this model: one USB-C port and one 1/8 inch headphone jack.</p>

<p>If you want to add any more ports you will have to buy expensive dongles which in my mind kind of negates the whole light and thin thing if you still have to carry around dongles to make it work with external peripherals.</p>

<p>But the pros of the MacBook are light weight, a beautiful 12 inch retina display and all day battery life of up to 9 hours mean you might not have to charge this thing over the course of the day.</p>

<p>The 11 inch Macbook Air on the other hand offers some pretty good arguments to choose this over the retina Macbook and that’s ports. Unlike the rMB, the 11 inch MBA offers the usual selection of ports like USB 3.0 ports and a thunderbolt port. The only missing port from the 11 inch model is the fact that it does not have a SDHC card reader for transferring photos from your camera to your Apple Macbook Air.</p>

<p>The display is also less sharp than the MacBook and for some this is a deal breaker because except for the 13 inch MacBook Pro with the spinning hard drive, the MacBook Air models are the only models to have TN panels for display which offer less sharpness, contrast and viewing angles.</p>

<p>This isn’t to say the Macbook Air 11 inch is bad, but the display is not as nice as computers with retina displays.</p>

<p>Battery life is claimed to be up to 9 hours so the difference in Battery life between the two are the same.</p>

<p>Lastly, I want to mention the difference in price. The Macbook Air in 11 inch form is considerably cheaper than than the new MacBook with a savings of over $400 you have to ask yourself if the bigger and better screen is worth the $400. If you keep and use your notebook a lot the answer might be yes because if you keep the Mac for 2 years the retina display costs $20.00 a less than $20.00 a month more over that time.</p>

<h3 id="inch-macbook-vs-13-inch-macbook-air">12 inch MacBook vs 13 inch MacBook Air</h3>

<p>This is even a harder decision to make because when you compare the two there’s even less difference in price and that makes your buying choice even harder.</p>

<p>Like the 11 inch model, many of the comparisons are the same but I won’t repeat myself here. The 13 inch model of course has a bigger display than the 11 inch model but the display is the same technology but there is a SDHC card on the 13 inch model where the 11 inch omits this feature.</p>

<h2 id="inch-macbook-vs-13-inch-macbook-pro-retina-display">12 inch MacBook vs 13 inch MacBook Pro Retina Display</h2>

<p>It gets even harder to choose from these two models because the price is the same, but that’s the one of the only features that the MacBook and 13 inch MacBook Pro have in common. Both also feature a retina display but that’s where the similarities end.</p>

<p>The MacBook is lighter and offers less ports and less power but it is designed more for travel compared to the 3.5lb MacBook Pro that offers a full compliment of ports as well as the slightly bigger display and can do double duty as both a desktop replacement as well as a portable computer.</p>

<p>But, if you’re like me and spend most of your time in a word processor then the power of the MacBook would be fine for most users. It’s a very hard choice to make: lighter and smaller vs bigger and more power?</p>

<h3 id="inch-macbook-vs-15-inch-macbook-pro">12 inch MacBook vs 15 inch MacBook Pro</h3>

<p>You really shouldn’t even compare these two models because they are different ends of the spectrum when it comes to size and performance. The 15 inch is definitely designed to be the most powerful notebook you can buy where the MacBook is the lightest and smallest. If you know you need power and want your Apple laptop to be the fastest notebook you can buy from Apple then obviously the 15 inch should be your choice.</p>

<h3 id="inch-macbook-air-vs-13-inch-macbook-pro-retina">13 inch MacBook Air vs 13 inch MacBook Pro Retina</h3>

<p>I will make this easy for you. If you need to buy the cheapest 13 inch MacBook Apple makes then buy the Air. Also you must consider the RAM and storage options between the two. The Air comes with half the RAM and storage as the MacBook Pro, forgetting about processor speed and display and yet there’s only a $300 difference between the two and if you build your 13 inch Air to have 8GB of RAM vs 4 then the cost is even with both machines costing exactly the same for 8/256GB configurations.</p>

<p>This makes it easy to decide in my opinion. Unless you really need the lighter weight of the Macbook Air then get the MacBook Pro because you get more speed and better display and the weight difference between the two is only about half a pound and oddly enough the MacBook Pro actually has a smaller footprint than the MacBook Air</p>

<h3 id="inch-macbook-air-vs-13-inch-macbook-air">11 inch MacBook Air vs 13 inch MacBook Air</h3>

<p>I think the big difference between the two of these models is price, weight and physical size. Except for the lack of a SDHC Card there’s not a lot of difference between the two. If I were to buy the MacBook Air it would be the 11 inch for the small size and cheap price. It’s not too hard to find a price of closer to $800 for the 2015 11 inch MacBook Air and that’s considerably less than the 13 inch versions available to buy.</p>

<h3 id="inch-macbook-pro-vs-15-inch-macbook-pro">13 inch MacBook Pro vs 15 inch MacBook Pro</h3>

<p>Here’s another choice that I think is pretty easy to make. If you need the fastest notebook you can buy and can stomach the $2000 or more price then the 15 inch is the model to buy. But if you just need fast enough processing in a pro level notebook from Apple, then the 13 inch MacBook Pro is the way to go because it’s over $700 cheaper when you compare the two models. Heck, you could almost buy a 13 inch MacBook Pro <strong>and</strong> an 11 inch MacBook Air for the same money as a 15 inch MacBook Pro.</p>

<h3 id="what-apple-notebook-should-you-buy">What Apple Notebook Should You Buy?</h3>

<p>As you can see above, that’s a pretty complicated question but if you can handle the weight I think the <strong>13 inch retina Macbook Pro is the Mac I would buy.</strong> I don’t need the maximum in portability as I work from home so I can live with the half pound more in weight. But if I am going to spend over a $1000 on a brand new Apple computer I want to make sure I get the Maximum vale and for me it’s the 13 inch rMBP.</p>

<p>The MacBook Air is starting to age, and so am I so I would appreciate the sharper display. I don’t really need the extra speed but I guess it would be nice to have in the odd chance I do some photo editing here and there.</p>

<p>The retina 12 inch Macbook looks interesting yet I don’t know I could get used to the keyboard and I don’t really need the light weight or the reduction in ports.</p>

<p>The 15 inch is just a crazy buy both in price and size and weight as well as speed so this really isn’t even a consideration for me at this time.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2015/06/what-are-the-differences-between-the-2015-macbook-vs-the-2015-macbook-air/">What are the Differences Between the 2015 MacBook vs the 2015 MacBook Air?</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><h2 id="age">Age</h2>

<p>Even though the MacBook Air release date and the MacBook Air refresh date are the same day, the MacBook Air models have been around for some time in earlier configurations</p>

<h2 id="configurations">Configurations</h2>

<h3 id="apple-macbook-configuration">2015 Apple Macbook Configuration</h3>

<p>The Apple MacBook is available in two versions and comes in 1.1Ghz and 1.2Ghz models.</p>

<p>The 1.1Ghz model ships standard with 8GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage with Turbo boost to 2.4Ghz</p>

<p>The 1.2 Ghz ships with the same amount of RAM but comes with a 512GB flash storage for more space for your files and applications.</p>

<p>The price difference between the two retina MacBook models is $300: $1299 for the base configuration or $1599 for the mode of MacBooks</p>

<h3 id="apple-11-inch-macbook-air-configurations">2015 Apple 11 inch MacBook Air Configurations</h3>

<p>When it comes to the MacBook Air there’s two configurations to choose from:</p>

<p>The $899 MacBook Air gets you a 1.6GHz processor with Turbo boost up to 2.7Ghz and 4GB of RAM with 128GB SSD flash storage come standard.</p>

<p>The $1099 11 inch MacBook Air gets you the same processor and RAM but a bigger 25GB SSD drive vs the 128GB capacity in the base configuration.</p>

<h2 id="ports">Ports</h2>

<p>The MaBook comes with just two ports: a USB-C port and a 1/8 headphone port.</p>

<p>The MacBook Air ships with many more ports and may be the deciding factor if you need to connect a lot of peripherals to your Mac. The Air offers 2 USB 3.0 ports, a thunderbolt port, a magsafe power port and a 1/8 headphone jack.</p>

<p>The 11 inch model offers minimal ports too compared to the 13 inch Apple notebooks but it still offer many more ports than the 12 inch MacBook does.</p>

<h2 id="display">Display</h2>

<p>The better display is on the 12 inch MacBook as the display on the rMB is a 2304-by-1440 IPS display with 226 pixels per inch and is a 16:10 ratio.</p>

<p>The 11 inch MacBook Air is the older TN panel display that’s pretty old and has been standard fare on the Apple portables for some time until the release of retina displays for the MacBook Pro models were released.</p>

<p>The 11 inch MacBook Air offers a 16:9 display ratio for a 1366 x 768px resolution as the native option</p>

<h2 id="processor">Processor</h2>

<p>I have already mentioned the speeds of the different models but the MacBook Air is actually the faster of the two models for more CPU intensive stuff but if you need the light weight of the MacBook then you might be okay with the slower MacBook.</p>

<h2 id="weight">Weight</h2>

<p>The 12 inch MacBook wins here but not by all that much:</p>

<p>The MacBook Air weighs 2.38lbs while the Macbook comes in at just over 2lbs at 2.03lbs.</p>

<p>Personally, I bet there’s very little difference in weight for everyday travel. I guess if you absolutely need the lightest notebook possible the MacBook wins, but I wouldn’t really let about a 1/4 lb be the deciding factor</p>

<h2 id="color">Color</h2>

<p>Here’s another thing I wouldn’t care for but some might. The MaBook is available in three colors: Gold, Space Grey and Silver whereas the MacBook Air is still silver, same as it always was.</p>

<h2 id="keyboard-and-trackpad">Keyboard and Trackpad</h2>

<p>The keyboard and trackpad technology is completely different between the two models. The MacBook offers a newly designed ‘butterfly’ keyboard design with a shallower travel vs the standard scissor design of the MacBook Air.</p>

<p>The trackpad is also all new on the MacBook with a <strong>force touch</strong> keyboard standard on Apple’s latest technology, while the MacBook Air still offers the standard multi-gesture glass trackpad we have all come to love</p>

<h2 id="battery-life">Battery Life</h2>

<p>Apple claims that the Battery on the MacBook lasts up to 10 hours and the MacBook Air offers 9 hours. Of course, both of these estimates are under the best operating conditions so your mileage will vary but I don’t see battery life being a real big problem for both computers as they both offer close to entire day of battery life.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>It’s a hard decision to choose between the 12 inch MacBook vs the 11 inch MacBook Air. The MacBook offers weight and battery life advantages along with some new hardware tech, while the 11 inch MacBook air for 2005 is really just a refresh of the same old design.</p>

<p>The display might be the big difference between the two that decides what MacBook to buy but personally, and for my needs – writing and very light image editing I think if I were to buy a new Apple notebook today I would buy the 11 inch MacBook Air.</p>

<p>Also, I don’t think the display on the 11 inch MacBook Air is all that bad either.</p>

<p>The MacBook looks like fun but at $1300 for the base model and the lack of ports that force you to buy adapters to connect peripherals make me want to hold off on this model until I see MacBook 2.0 in 2016.</p>

<p>Apple hasn’t specifically released compatibility charts with the El Capitan release because at this point it’s just beta software so changes could be made but for now it looks like the ansers is that  if your Mac can run <a href="http://www.apple.com/osx/">Yosemite</a> , then there’s a really good chance you can run the newer beta operating system too, and currently that means that  the following computers will work with OSX 10.11 according to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/mac/releasenotes/General/rn-osx-10.11/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40016209">this page</a>&lt;section class="section"&gt;</p>

<p class="para">
  The OS X v10.11 Developer Beta supports the following Macs:
</p>

<ul class="list-bullet">
  <li class="item">
    <p class="para">
      iMac (Mid 2007 or newer)
    </p>
  </li>
  
  <li class="item">
    <p class="para">
      MacBook Air (Late 2008 or newer)
    </p>
  </li>
  
  <li class="item">
    <p class="para">
      MacBook (Late 2008 Aluminum, or Early 2009 or newer)
    </p>
  </li>
  
  <li class="item">
    <p class="para">
      Mac mini (Early 2009 or newer)
    </p>
  </li>
  
  <li class="item">
    <p class="para">
      MacBook Pro (Mid/Late 2007 or newer)
    </p>
  </li>
  
  <li class="item">
    <p class="para">
      Mac Pro (Early 2008 or newer)
    </p>
  </li>
  
  <li class="item">
    <p class="para">
      Xserve (Early 2009)
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This is good news indeed for those of us that have older Macs and want to keep them running for as long as possible.&lt;/section&gt;</p>

<p>Granted, not ALL features will work on the older Macs: For example features like continuity and handoff might not be compatible with your hardware. But, if you’re like me and have an older Mac and  don’t really need <strong>all the features  of the Mac OS </strong>but you still want to try the new beta Mac OS X when it’s released in July then this is pretty great news. I thought for sure my 2008 Aluminum MacBook would be put out to pasture as it would not  be compatible with this latest release but it looks like I can still use my older Mac  with the Latest Mac OS which is pretty amazing for a 7 year old computer to be able to do.</p>

<p>I’m looking forward to giving the new beta a try when it’s released later in July 2015.</p>
