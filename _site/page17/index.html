<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>Ben Brooks at <a href="http://www.brooksreview.net">Brooks Review</a> has researched most, if not all of the content blockers available for iOS and has come up with a <a href="https://brooksreview.net/2015/09/content-blocker-test/">four part review of all the most popular content blockers</a> available and what are the fastest:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Which content blocker for iOS 9 is the best? I have no clue, but I did test a bunch to find out which one is the fastest.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you want to speed up your browsing experience and stop getting tracked by websites then you need a good content blocker and Ben’s results can help you find the right one.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Wikipedia is thoroughly useable in a mobile browser. It’s quite easy to search, browse, and read this massive repository of information with mobile Safari or what-have-you. The use case for a dedicated app is in the fact that Wikipedia isn’t meant for casual reading. It’s a reference tool. To get the most out of it, you must look beyond a web browser.</p>

		<div class="post-content"><p>Everymac.com has compiled a great article on the <a href="http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/iphone/iphone-faq/differences-between-iphone-6s-iphone-6s-plus-models.html">differences between the two latest Apple iPhones for 2015:</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It would be easy to take a look at the larger iPhone 6s Plus and smaller iPhone 6s side-by-side and conclude that size is the differentiating factor. Although there is some truth to this general observation, there are other important differences that are not so obvious.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you’re looking to compare the two models this site looks at the differences between camera, battery life, screens and even identification differences so you can tell the 2 apart this is the resource you need.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Chromecast Audio is an interesting product, but after I spent about an hour or so playing around with it, I realized that I don’t really have much of a need for it. But that doesn’t mean it’s a bad product, necessarily, just that my setup doesn’t really lend itself to this device.</p>

<p>I have been interested in this device to replace my bluetooth wireles transmitter device and this is one of the first reviews I have seen.</p>

   <B> <h1><a href="/2015/10/the-rise-and-fall-of-mac-os-x-versions/">The Rise and Fall of Mac OS X Versions</a></h1></B>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>Dan Knight at Low End Mac has <a href="http://lowendmac.com/2015/the-rise-and-fall-of-mac-os-x-versions-2009-to-2015/">quite the interesting chart</a> with six years of data of the Mac OS versions that are used when visiting his site from 2009 to 2015:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Over time, the distribution of Mac OS versions among Mac users changes as new versions of the OS are released, old Macs are retired, and new models arrive that only support the most recent version. Today we’re looking at six years worth of data.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I bet this took a fair bit of time to gather all the data and chart it all out.</p>

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>I’m not sure why you would want to do this but there’s software that  will allow to turn certain older Macs (and PC’s) into Chromebooks. <a href="http://neveware.com">Neverware</a> is <strong>free for individuals</strong> or you can pay a monthly fee for eductators with more support.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>CloudReady only runs one thing: a browser. This makes for a bloat-proof and lightweight OS that can keep machines up to 8 years old fast and responsive.</p>

  <p>You don’t need to get a new machine to experience a market-leading OS or get reliable performance. CloudReady works on the computers you already have and lets cloud-services do the heavy lifting.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not all Macs or PCs are supported, but a good number are.  One thing I did notice  is all the Macs they support will still run OSX El Capitan which gives you <strong>a lot more features </strong>than Chrome OS does but I’m going to guess this OS runs much faster on your old Mac. Check out all models neverware will run on <a href="http://go.neverware.com/certifiedmodels">here</a></p>

		<div class="post-content"><p>I have been wanting to change the look and layout of ramseeker for some time, yet still keep some of older design cues from when the site was first designed some 15 plus years ago and I think I’ve got the look I want.<sup id="fnref-13071-vary"><a href="#fn-13071-vary" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>I was going to write about my plans for ramseeker.com going forward but my [about][1] page pretty much sums up my plans so no sense in repeating myself.</p>

   <B> <h1><a href="/2015/10/simplemark-markdown-tool-for-powerpc-macs/">SimpleMark Markdown Tool for PowerPC Macs</a></h1></B>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>This is a neat find: There’s actually a markdown writing program for the PowerPC called <a href="http://g5center.net/simplemark/">Simple Mark</a></p>

<p>I found it at<a href="http://g5center.net/index.php"> G5 Center</a>, which is a site dedicated to all things PowerMac G5:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Power Mac G5 was one of the last PowerPC machines <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> produced and sold. It remains a capable computer today. This website is dedicated to the venerable machine, providing users with information on available hardware and software choices for their G5.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I never did get around to owning a Power Mac G5, but I’ve always loved the looks and I bet with the processor-light workflow I have I could probably be pretty productive on a ten-plus year old Mac. If I did get one I would of course <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/apple-powermac-g5-memory-upgrades/">max out the ram</a></p>

<p><em>incidentally, the Power Mac G5 is Low End Mac’s <a href="http://lowendmac.com/2005/power-mac-g5-early-2005/">Mac of the day</a> today</em></p>
