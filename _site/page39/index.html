<div style="float: right; margin-right: 5px;">
  It&#8217;s been said in the computing field there&#8217;s no such thing as too much ram or hard drive space, and it&#8217;s so true. As our need for both hard drive space and memory increases over the years (it wasn&#8217;t that long ago that 250gb of hard drive space was a big deal, as so was 1GB of memory upgrade space)
</div>

[<img title="Cheap Solid State Hard Drives" alt="Cheap Drives, Solid State. " src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Screen-shot-2011-04-11-at-2.58.01-PM.png" width="241" height="179" />][1]

**[Solid Sate Hard Drives for MacBook][1]**

But times change and before you know it, the hard drive on your MacBook is full, or getting there thanks to the demands of modern computing such as MP3 and movie downloads , not to mention the bloated operating systems that despite the fact offer more speed and functionality and are much more intuititive than OS&#8217;s of before &#8211; these software programs take up a lot of space, and usually more space than what you what came with the hard drive installed inside your Apple notebook computer.

**MacBook Hard Drives are Cheap**

The good news is that not only are MacBook hard drives offer more capacity at less money than ever before, if you install your original factory hard drive in and external case (usually a USB case), then you now have an instant backup of your MacBook and in most cases &#8211; for traditional SATA hard drives, the hard drives cost under $100.

Another option when considering a MacBook hard drive upgrade is to keep your factory hard drive in an external hard drive case as mentioned before, but instead of buying a standard hard drive, buy a cheap solid state hard drive for startup files and regularly accessed files and use your original MacBook hard drive for stuff you don&#8217;t use as much.

**Cheap Hard Drives for MacBook. **

As the MacBook ships from Apple with a 250GB hard drive you, in my opinion at least want to double your MacBook hard drive space so starting with the **Western Digital Scorpion Blue 500GB internal SATA hard **drive that&#8217;s currently **[**on sale for less than sixty dollars**][2] is a fantastic MacBook hard drive option, especially for the price. **

**If you want even more space than what the 500GB Western Digital drive offers, there&#8217;s also a 1TB version which offers four times the space, enough for more than enough data for your files and this [notebook hard drive will cost just over $100][3]**

**[Solid State Hard Drives][4] are one other option when it comes to more space for your MacBook but be aware that solid state technology is still new and therefore, quite expensive when you compare the prices to more traditional hard drives which can be had for much less. **

**To just match or replace the standard 250GB hard drive in your Macbook with a similar hard drive will cost you close to 1000 dollars &#8211; as much as the price of the MacBook itself. But if you need speed and portability over space then a SSD or solid state hard drive upgrade still makes sense and smaller size SSD hard drives can be bought for much less, making a MacBook solid state drive upgrade a worthy upgrade option for those in the market for more speed yet sacrifice on total space.**

&nbsp;

[Hard Drive Upgrade Costs for MacBook][5] keep dropping and as you can see from above, there&#8217;s more than one method to upgrade your MacBook hard drive and still keep things affordable, especially if you stick to traditional hard drive technology where you can get the most bang per buck for your [MacBook upgrade][6] dollar.

Goodness Gracious, No.

Unless you have money to burn, I suggest you **[buy memory for any Apple computer][1]** from **anywhere but Apple. **

There was a time when yes, you did have to buy Apple specific ram, but that was, oh, in the late &#8217;90&#8217;s and for the last decade or so you don&#8217;t need to buy Apple branded memory and as long as the ram for your Apple computer meets Apple&#8217;s specific requirements &#8211; you&#8217;re good to go with a few caveats.

**Low Price [Apple RAM][2]**

Depending on where or whom you end up buying Apple RAM from, you could either get the best deal on memory or the biggest headache going, and it all comes down to pretty much one thing and that&#8217;s customer service. If you&#8217;re not buying RAM from Apple and want to save money on RAM you&#8217;re probably looking at buying generic memory upgrades which tend to be the lowest priced memory you can buy today, and as long as the technical specs are OK with the technical specifications for memory as outlined in your [Apple&#8217;s manual][3], you&#8217;re good to go and can buy the cheap ram.

Where you might get into trouble when buying ram from third party memory stores is when it comes down to what store or memory reseller you buy memory  from, so to help you with a choice on where to buy ram  from vendors you can trust, I created a list of the **[best memory stores][4]** that I would deal with happily (and have).

As long as you stick to the stores on the list, ([ram prices are here][5]), you&#8217;ll be just fine and  you can get the best price on RAM upgrades for Apple, and pay far less than what Apple would charge you for the same ram upgrades.

**A bit more expensive, but still cheaper than Apple when it comes to memory upgrades.**

If the thought of [buying RAM][6] from the stores I  list give you the heebie jeebies, but you still want to save money but don&#8217;t mind paying for a better quality product than generic memory can offer, you would be worse  off than to buy either **[Kingston RAM][7]** or **[Crucial Memory][8]** &#8211;  two name brand manufacturers that not  only make the ram , but sell and support the Apple memory upgrades you buy too.

**Name brand RAM** is still cheaper than what Apple charges, and yet you will get a high quality memory product that&#8217;s priced far, far less than what Apple charges.

**[Apple  Computer is the Best Computer Brand][1] and one of the Best 2011 Laptops**

Well, it&#8217;s no secret that I&#8217;m a [fan of Apple computers][2] and have been for some time, but in the last decade PC computers have dropped in price not just with notebooks and desktops,but with netbook computer too, which are the cheapest computers you can buy and easily be found for less than two hundred dollars from jus about every notebook PC manufacturer except Apple, which some will say charge too too much for their products when you can buy computers from other PC brands for less.

[<img class="alignnone" title="best computer brand" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Screen-shot-2011-04-09-at-4.17.40-PM.png" alt="" width="298" height="232" />  
][1]  
All other PC brands rely on the Windows OS to operate and for some, this could either be an advantage or a curse, depending on your perspective. For my case,  I prefer the Apple OS for one reason only, and that&#8217;s the fact that I grew up with the Mac OS  and  when using the windows OS, it confuses me to no end but the same could be same for the Mac OS. One good thing about the Windows OS is that for some of us, there&#8217;s a Mac software  version for popular Mac applications that will run on the Windows OS.. Safari and iTunes both come with versions that will run on Windows OS just fine.

If all you&#8217;re doing with your PC is web browsing and itunes, you can now do these things on about every smartphone built today so some might argue why bother with the Mac OS when a much cheaper brand of computer will do just fine. I know in my household, I&#8217;m a Mac obviously  but my significant other can&#8217;t fathom of paying a premium for an Apple computer when a perfectly fine notebook to her runs the windows OS  and saves her money in the process?

Regardless of what side of the Mac/PC fence you  sit on, the **top ten computer brands to buy** today are:

  1. **Apple**
  2. **Toshiba**
  3. **Asus**
  4. **Dell**
  5. **Samsung**
  6. **HP**
  7. **Compaq**
  8. **Sony **
  9. **Lenovo**
 10. **Gateway **

The data above is based on the **best selling notebook computers** available **[on sale at Amazon][3]**

<br>

		<div class="post-content">One other place where you&#8217;ll be paying more for memory is if you want to **upgrade a Mac Pro,** this ram is not the **cheapest RAM for Apple computers** and at the time of writing, [64GB for Apple Mac Pro is still a pretty pricey proposition][1].

That&#8217;s how much it costs to add ram to a Mac computer, or Apple Macintosh Computer as they are formally known, and as I have said above adding memory to almost any Mac computer is a pretty good deal. A few exceptions right now will be 16 GB for MacBook Pros, which are still pretty pricey and can cost as much as buying a new MacBook Pro costs in the first place. I&#8217;ve yet to have the opportunity to test a MacBook Pro with 16GB and I&#8217;m doing just fine on 4GB in a MacBook Pro, and have for a few years now so this just goes to show you that if you&#8217;ve got 4 to 8GB of memory installed, you have more than enough RAM installed already. In fact, there&#8217;s one website that&#8217;s dedicated to [helping you get more out of your older Mac][2], negating the need to buy ram or a new Mac at all.Cheap, Cheap, Cheap.

But for most other Macs, especially consumer macs for everyday use &#8211; or &#8216;lifestyle&#8217; computers as they are sometimes known &#8211;  RAM upgrades are a really good deal right now and 8GB notebook ram, not just for Apple Notebooks too, is **priced under $100**.

This [cheap $100 ram upgrade][3] for both notebooks and desktops that Apple makes maxes out you RAM for both the MacBook Pro and Apple iMac two of the best selling computers Apple makes today, and at time I write this **you can use the same memory in both iMacs and MacBook Pros**.

**Where to get the best deal on Mac RAM today? **

I maintain.  a list of the [best apple ram prices][4] where you can see the **best prices on Apple RAM **from  an variety  of computer memory stores that offer the best prices on computer memory today for your Apple Mac computer, regardless of whether  you want to upgrade a MacBook, Mac Pro or  iMac &#8211; just a few of the **[best selling Apple computers][5]** available on sale today.

</div>

The **cost of 4GB RAM memory upgrades** my friends is the sweet spot of ram upgrades currently in 2011 when it comes to **[buying RAM for your MacBook Pro][1]**.

The 16GB MacBook Pro RAM is still too pricey to really pay attention to unless you have deep deep pockets or really really need the extra performance. I have yet to test 16GB for MacBook Pro, but it only makes sense that MacBook Pros will run faster with double the RAM that Apple states as the maximum, which is 8GB of RAM.

This is why 4GB of RAM for MacBook Pros are the most popular memory modules for MacBook Pros today, and that&#8217;s because of the fact that 4GB RAM price for MacBook Pro continue to drop over time, and buying two of them will fill your MacBook Pro and this applies to both the Apple MacBook Pros made in 2011, and  just released a month or so ago, and the later MacBook Pros with the latest refresh being in the spring of 2010.

**MacBook Pro RAM Types**

The new MacBook Pros announced Feb 24, 2011 take different memory upgrades than what is available or was available for the older 2010 MacBook Pros, so unfortunately, you cannot take the ram from your 2010 MacBook Pro with you and install  it in your new 2011 MacBook Pro &#8211; You will have to buy new 4GB ram upgrades for the new MacBook Pros, as they require 4GB DDR3 1333MHz SDRAM so-dimms, while the older MacBook Pros ran on 4GB DDR3 1066Mhz SDRAM so-dimm and the two are not interchangeable.

**4GB MacBook RAM Memory Prices**

The good news is that if you fill your MBP with 2x 4gb RAM modules, you can do so at a cost of under $100 currently and  in some cases, less as some stores like OWC and OEMPCWORLD will buy back the factory installed memory upgrades that were in your MacBook Pro reducing the price of your MacBook Pro RAM to even less..  There&#8217;s no reason to spend more than $50 for a 4GB Apple MacBook Pro Memory Upgrade. Below are the best deals you can find  on Apple 4GB MacBook Pro RAM today for both newer and older MacBoo Pro models.

This one&#8217;s easy, as when we&#8217;re talking about MacBooks and **not MacBook Pro&#8217;s or Airs**, there&#8217;s only one MacBook currently on sale that you  can buy and that&#8217;s the 2.4GHz Apple MacBook in white with a MSRP of $999. ([you can do better on the price][1])

**MacBook White 2011 2.4GHz **([see lowest price][1])

Now if it were my choice and you don&#8217;t need to save every penny to **[buy a MacBook][1]**, I would do all I can and **[buy  the MacBook Pro][2]** instead in the same 13.3 inch format as the MacBook but adds a whole lot more features when you compare the two side by side. On the new MacBook Pro there&#8217;s a **faster processor, more RAM capability and the new Thunderbolt technology** that will be the defacto standard when connecting other devices sooner than you&#8217;d think.

[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1651" title="Best MacBook Ever" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Screen-shot-2011-04-03-at-4.25.22-PM.png" alt="Best MacBook To Buy Today" width="298" height="243" />][2]

**13 inch MacBook Pro: Best of  All MacBooks** ([click to see price][2])

The MacBook is a nice computer, no doubt but with the last refresh being last year in May 2010, the MacBook is starting to show it&#8217;s age, especially when compared to the newer big brother. Unless you need to buy a much cheaper computer, I would stick with the MBP when shopping for a MacBook this year as the MacBook Pro&#8217;s are the newest and fastest MacBooks.

Let&#8217;s compare:

**Processor**

MacBook: 2.4 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo

MacBook Pro: 2.3GHz dual-core Intel Core i5

**RAM**

MacBook: 2GB standard, up to 4GB allowed

MacBook Pro: 4GB standard, up to 8GB allowed (16GB, according to [OWC][3])

**Graphics**

MacBook:NVIDIA GeForce 320M graphics processor with 256MB of DDR3 SDRAM shared with main memory

MacBook  Pro: Intel HD Graphics 3000

**Storage**

MacBook: 8x superdrive, 250GB Hard Drive

MacBook Pro: 320GB Hard Drive, 8x SuperDrive

**I/O interfaces **

MacBook: USB 2.0

MacBook Pro: USB 2.0, FireWire 800, ThunderBolt  Port

As you can see, for the added $200 expense the 13 inch 2.3GHz MacBook Pro is the winner here as it adds the same clock speed, (close enough)  but with a much faster Intel processor.

**Lightest MacBook**

**[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1653" title="Lightest MacBook of All" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Screen-shot-2011-04-03-at-4.29.46-PM.png" alt="Best Small Apple Notebook 2011" width="297" height="247" />][4]**

**MacBook Air. The lightest MacBook **([click for best price][5])

And just to make things even more confusing there&#8217;s the **[MacBook Air][6]**, which for those needing the smallest and lightest Apple notebooks, this is the choice you&#8217;re looking for. The upside with the MacBook Air is the weight of course, weighing just 2.3 lbs, the 11 inch MacBook Air is the lightest notebook you can buy and they start the same as the white MacBook&#8217;s do at $999.

The MacBook Air is stripped of a lot of stuff in order to make it the cheapest and lightest MacBook. Gone are the hard drive and optical drive. For the optical drive, you can buy an extra optical drive that plugs into the MacBook Air. If you need an optical drive, I would  suggest you buy a MacBook white  instead as I see no point in trying to slug around a CD drive, as it negates the portability of the MacBook Air in the first place.  Another thing gone on the MacBook Air is the hard drive, which instead is replaced with  a 64GB or 128GB hard drive depending on the configuration of MacBook Air you buy. There&#8217;s also a 13 inch MacBook Air, but I think for any serious work, the 1.4GHz Intel Core 2 processor is back in time, even if the SSD hard drive speeds  up read and writing of data.

So. If you really, really need the lightest Apple notebook you can buy, then **[grab the MacBook Air][6]**, but the best selling and best deal when it comes to MacBooks in 2011 is currently the **[Apple MacBook Pro 13 inch][2]** and with some shopping around for the best price can be had closer to the $999 list price of the white MacBook than you would believe.

**[Buy the 13inch MacBook Pro ][2]**as currently, it&#8217;s the **best MacBook of  the bunch**.

   <B> <h1><a href="/2011/04/best-2011-notebook-computer-brands/">Best Notebook Computer Brands and Best Selling Laptops</a></h1></B>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content">Well, we all know I&#8217;m a big fan of [one particular computer brand][1] but there&#8217;s others. But not everybody drinks the koolaid and is willing to pay the premium that my favorite computer brand and there&#8217;s lots of other brands from major manufacturers of best selling notebooks in 2011. When you&#8217;re in the market for a new notebook computer you you&#8217;ve got more than one brand choice when you&#8217;re shopping for the best selling laptops 2011 has to offer so far.

**The Apple MacBook Pro is the best notebook Apple makes**

If you haven&#8217;t figured this out by now, I am a tad bit biased when it comes to shopping for a new notebook, but lots of you aren&#8217;t willing to pay the premium when it comes to the price that Apple demands for their laptops and with their lowest priced or cheapest laptop costing you at least $999 for the best price on a brand new Apple notebook, that&#8217;s a lot of coin for some of us (me too) and much cheaper Windows 7 notebooks are available for under $200 if you do a bit of online shopping.

## Toshiba

&nbsp;

**Best Toshiba Notebook. About half the price of the Apple notebook above.**

Toshiba to me, although perhaps not as well know  as HP or Dell, always seemed to me to make a superior product in my limited knowledge when it comes to Windows OS PC Brands. I have had a few opportunities to shop for a windows notebook, because even though I&#8217;ve confessed my love for Apple,  theree&#8217;s some things the Mac OS can&#8217;t do, and I&#8217;ve never had good look running Parallels, software that lets yuu run windows on your Mac and prefer  to just buy a PC notebook and the Toshibas always tended  to look like a higher quality  PC to my admittedly  untrained knowledge when it  comes to notebooks.

And this is where Windows PC&#8217;s just beat Apple hands down, and that&#8217;s price. Where the best selling notebook from Apple has a street price of about $1100 or maybe a bit more, the most popular Toshiba notebook  sits with a street price of  just over $500, or half the price of the Apple notebook above.

## Acer

&nbsp;

**Cheapest Acer Notebook Today**

Acer, when compared to Toshiba is a relatively newer notebook  manufacturer (please correct me if I&#8217;m wrong), at least when compared to the bigger brand names of  notebooks such as Apple or HP or Dell, but one thing that Acer, and to an extent all makers of notebook computers is price. When compared to the Apple notebook  above, the best selling acer notebook can be had for under $400 online. That&#8217;s one third the price of the  Apple MacBook Pro, and depending on your needs you might be better off buying two acer notebooks with one for work and one for  home still costing you  less than what Apple charges.  For $400, you can&#8217;t really compare when it comes to performance but for light computing needs an Acer Computer would do just fine.

## HP

&nbsp;

**One of the Better Notebooks from HP This Year**

Hewlett Packad is a very well known computer maker, not just of latpop computers, but desktop computers, printers in both inkjet and laser format and a host of  other electronics including digital cameras and more. HP have  done really well to brand  themselves as more of a higher end computer maker and although the do make cheaper notebooks they really shine lately when it comes to entertainment PCs as the line between computer and TV are getting more and more blurry. Once, just used for word processing and desktop publishing, modern HP notebooks in 2011 feature stereo built in speakers, fast graphics for video and  in some models, even a remote control is included in the price.

## Dell

&nbsp;

**Dell Inspiron is on of the cheaper notebooks made by Dell.**

Dell can offer lowest prices on notebooks as this was one of the first computer brands to ship direct to the consumer and although in 2011 there are a few exceptions, your Dell notebook comes straight from Dell, eliminating any costs that resellers add  to notebook computer. This results in some of the cheapest notebooks available today. Over the years Dell has grown to sell everything from dell branded HDTV&#8217;s to desktop computers, but some of the core reasons to shop for a dell is for their affordable inspiron notebooks like the 15 inch dell notebook on sale pictured above.

Very carefully.

In some ways I joke because as long as you [follow the instructions][1] on iMac 27 inch RAM upgrade instructions as provided by Apple that won&#8217;t void your warranty in any way and make your iMac run faster for cheaper than you have ever imagined you&#8217;ll be absolutely fine as adding iMac 27 inch RAM isn&#8217;t complicated or difficult at all.

On the other side of the coin, adding memory to you Mac does require some precautions as there is a slim chance you could zap not only the RAM upgrade you&#8217;re trying to install but your Apple iMac too, and that my friends, is not a good idea or something I recommend. The biggest precaution you have to make when it comes to iMac RAM upgrades is to fight against static electricity when installing the memory.

As you will see with the Apple Memory Upgrade Installation  Instructions, upgrading RAM on the 27 inch iMac is pretty easy and once you remove the cover on the bottom of the iMac you have full access to the memory upgrade slots that can accept up to 16GB of RAM using four 4 GB DDR3 SDRAM 133 MHz sodimms.

It&#8217;s just a matter of removing the factory RAM from the iMac, which is usually formatted in 2x2GB or 2&#215;4 GB memory configurations and installing more memory in the empty two upgrade slots on the 27 inch iMac. If your iMac came shipped with 8GB of RAM in a 2x4GB configuration, this means you have two more empty memory upgrade slots where you can buy and install another two 4GB imac memory module and effectively doubling and maximizing the RAM your iMac uses.

**Where to Buy iMac 27 inch RAM**

I monitor ram prices for Apple iMac 27 inch computers from a variety of memory manufacturers and vendors so  I suggest this to be a good place to start when shopping for deals on iMac RAM as the other thing you have to be aware of is paying too much money for you iMac RAM as you  have worked hard for that money and you want to maximize not only the iMac&#8217;s RAM but also the savings on RAM.

With that in mind, below are the cheapest Apple iMac 27 inch memory upgrades on sale currently:

[table id=2 /]

Memory Installations on the Apple 27 inch iMac are cheap and easy to do yourself with common sense and household tools and will make your iMac computing experience a joy for years to come.

**[Best Selling HP Desktop Computer. Priced under $500][1]**

What is the best computer 2011? (I also get asked what is the best 2011 laptop too)

I get asked this a fair bit, probably just behind what the best computers 2011 offers and what should I buy which is another thing I get asked, so rather than answer this question again privately,  I thought  I would answer your question here and look at the Top 3 HP desktop computers on sale and why they are the best desktops from HP you can buy this year to date:[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1613" style="border-style: initial; border-color: initial;" title="Best HP Desktop" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-31-at-2.03.19-PM.png" alt="Cheapest HP Desktop " width="504" height="468" />][1]

# [HP Pavilion p6720f][2]

The HP Pavilion currently tops the best selling HP desktops list as it balances the low price that all desktop PC&#8217;s are associated with when compared to days gone by but still offers the best performance of any other desktop computer by HP. Featuring an AMD Phenom II 840T Quad-Core Processor with 6GB of RAM standard (expandable to 16GB), a 1TB hard drive for more than enough room for your files, and Windows 7 64 bit operating system installed with a fast ATI RadeonTM HD 4200 integrated graphics card  that offers fast and responsive video &#8211; great for movies or gaming, just two applications that require the fastest video card money can buy. Priced at just a touch over $500 this is the best value desktop from HP available today.

# [HP Pavilion Slimline s5710f PC][3]

The HP Pavilion Slimline S5710f  comes in a much smaller form factor than a full sized PC but don&#8217;t let the small size or even smaller price fool you. This is one serious  HP desktop PC and ships standard with an AMD Athlon II 260 Dual Core Processor, 3GB of DDR3 RAM, 640GB hard drive, and Windows 7 all come as standard equipment on this tiny PC from HP that looks stylish on any desk, a perfect solution from HP where space is a consideration when buying a desktop PC, regardless of computer brand.

# [HP Pavilion p6750f Special Edition][4]

The HP Pavilion P6750 Special Edition is priced with a street price of just over $500 and offers a stylish ocean inspired design for spaces where it matters that your desktop looks as much as it performs. This HP desktop is not all about looks, no this is one of the top 3 computers today from HP thanks to a fast Intel E6700 processor,  Windows 7 64bit pre-installed and 4GB of RAM or Memory  with a big 1TB hard drive as standard equipment and all for a low low price that&#8217;s too low to display here it&#8217;s such a great deal on a HP Desktop.

HP desktop technology will increase over time, and the desktops will get even faster  with more performance as they always do, but when shopping for a HP desktop this year in 2011 these are the best HP desktops available today.

		<div class="post-content">[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1621" title="Best Deal on AppleCare" alt="Cheap Apple Care " src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-31-at-3.51.55-PM.png" width="304" height="329" />][1]

**MacBook Pro Applecare. **

**[Save on AppleCare for MacBook Pro. ][2]**

This is a good question, and at $250 for another 2 years of limited warranty and almost 3 years of phone support some may argue that AppleCare is the best value no nonsense Apple warranty you can buy, while others might tend to think it&#8217;s the biggest waste of money possible and you would be much better off self insuring your new MacBook Pro yourself.

First off, let&#8217;s forget about the telephone support as I think for a professional notebook buyer this is waste of time. You&#8217;re buying a pro notebook  from Apple  so I&#8217;m going to assume you know how to use the thing, or at very least you know how to use the tools with your MacBook Pro whether  they are Adobe Photoshop  for graphics pros or Microsoft Office for business professionals, it&#8217;s highly unlikely you&#8217;ll use the phone support. At least I never have and with  every new Mac I have ever bought, I just unwrap or unbox the Mac and get to work.

The limited warranty is the kicker I think.  On  one  hand you could argue that the one year warranty that ships with every Mac is more than enough for finding out if you&#8217;ve got a dud of a Mac as that&#8217;s a year of bumps and bruises and reboots and restarts and there is going to be a problem with your new Apple notebook, it would have reared it&#8217;s ugly head by now.

On the other side of the argument, $250 for another 2 years of warranty is a pretty good deal and assuming this is a business computer the AppleCare might be considered a cost of doing business resulting in tax writeoff or refund and even if it isn&#8217;t in your case, ten dollars a month for Apple Warranty seems like a pretty good deal for the additional warranty and when you consider that AppleCare only adds another ten percent to your total MacBook Pro cost, give or take &#8211; the AppleCare for MacBook Pro seems like a no brainer.

I&#8217;ve never bothered with AppleCare for MacBook Pro, as even though a MacBook Pro should get you through three years  or so before you start lusting for a faster Mac, I tend to just trade my old MacBook Pro in for a newer  Mac notebook. My approach is this:

New MacBook Pro Price: $2500.

MacBook Pro traded in a year later for $1000.

This means I now have a $1000 credit for my brand new next generation MacBook Pro with another year  of AppleCare warranty included without having to buy AppleCare ever. Yes, it costs me $1500 for the year I have the current  MBP, but  I earn much more money with my MacBook Pro than $100 or  so a month, so I don&#8217;t care and I get a new MacBook Pro every year without having to buy additional AppleCare and  I would rather put the $125 a year to newer technology which allows me  to work even faster than before, another added benefit of this approach. Buying more insurance does not get my work done any faster.

Essentially, by opting out of buying AppleCare and just replacing my Mac every year when the warranty is up I have no need for AppleCare. The downside  of this approach is I&#8217;m losing $1500 per year (estimated) by doing this and keeping  my MacBook Pro for longer than a year would definitely be the more frugal choice, even with the added costs of Apple. Assuming I kept my MacBook Pro for three years &#8211; the same length of time as the AppleCare coverage and the MacBook Pro was entirely worthless at the end of those 36 month, my total yearly cost for my MacBook Pro, including the extended warranty of the AppleCare would be about $800 per year

If saving money on your computer purchases is your main concern, then AppleCare is the best deal as it allows you to extend the life of your MBP knowing you&#8217;ve got full limited warranty coverage from Apple. The downside to this is approach is that your Apple Notebook will be pretty slow when you compare it to newer models at the time.

If you prefer to use a new MacBook Pro year after year, then buying AppleCare for MacBook Pro is not worth it as it&#8217;s not needed. Every year when you buy a new MacBook Pro will come with AppleCare included. The downside to this method is you will be hit with high depreciation costs when it comes time to trade in your MacBook Pro at the end of the first year and your total computing costs will be significantly higher.

You have to decide what route suits your needs best when it comes to **[buying extended warranty coverage for your Mac][2]**.
