    <h1><a href="/2011/04/best-2011-notebook-computer-brands/">Best Notebook Computer Brands and Best Selling Laptops</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>Well, we all know I’m a big fan of <a href="http://www.apple.com">one particular computer brand</a> but there’s others. But not everybody drinks the koolaid and is willing to pay the premium that my favorite computer brand and there’s lots of other brands from major manufacturers of best selling notebooks in 2011. When you’re in the market for a new notebook computer you you’ve got more than one brand choice when you’re shopping for the best selling laptops 2011 has to offer so far.</p>

<p><strong>The Apple MacBook Pro is the best notebook Apple makes</strong></p>

<p>If you haven’t figured this out by now, I am a tad bit biased when it comes to shopping for a new notebook, but lots of you aren’t willing to pay the premium when it comes to the price that Apple demands for their laptops and with their lowest priced or cheapest laptop costing you at least $999 for the best price on a brand new Apple notebook, that’s a lot of coin for some of us (me too) and much cheaper Windows 7 notebooks are available for under $200 if you do a bit of online shopping.</p>

<h2 id="toshiba">Toshiba</h2>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>Best Toshiba Notebook. About half the price of the Apple notebook above.</strong></p>

<p>Toshiba to me, although perhaps not as well know  as HP or Dell, always seemed to me to make a superior product in my limited knowledge when it comes to Windows OS PC Brands. I have had a few opportunities to shop for a windows notebook, because even though I’ve confessed my love for Apple,  theree’s some things the Mac OS can’t do, and I’ve never had good look running Parallels, software that lets yuu run windows on your Mac and prefer  to just buy a PC notebook and the Toshibas always tended  to look like a higher quality  PC to my admittedly  untrained knowledge when it  comes to notebooks.</p>

<p>And this is where Windows PC’s just beat Apple hands down, and that’s price. Where the best selling notebook from Apple has a street price of about $1100 or maybe a bit more, the most popular Toshiba notebook  sits with a street price of  just over $500, or half the price of the Apple notebook above.</p>

<h2 id="acer">Acer</h2>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>Cheapest Acer Notebook Today</strong></p>

<p>Acer, when compared to Toshiba is a relatively newer notebook  manufacturer (please correct me if I’m wrong), at least when compared to the bigger brand names of  notebooks such as Apple or HP or Dell, but one thing that Acer, and to an extent all makers of notebook computers is price. When compared to the Apple notebook  above, the best selling acer notebook can be had for under $400 online. That’s one third the price of the  Apple MacBook Pro, and depending on your needs you might be better off buying two acer notebooks with one for work and one for  home still costing you  less than what Apple charges.  For $400, you can’t really compare when it comes to performance but for light computing needs an Acer Computer would do just fine.</p>

<h2 id="hp">HP</h2>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>One of the Better Notebooks from HP This Year</strong></p>

<p>Hewlett Packad is a very well known computer maker, not just of latpop computers, but desktop computers, printers in both inkjet and laser format and a host of  other electronics including digital cameras and more. HP have  done really well to brand  themselves as more of a higher end computer maker and although the do make cheaper notebooks they really shine lately when it comes to entertainment PCs as the line between computer and TV are getting more and more blurry. Once, just used for word processing and desktop publishing, modern HP notebooks in 2011 feature stereo built in speakers, fast graphics for video and  in some models, even a remote control is included in the price.</p>

<h2 id="dell">Dell</h2>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>Dell Inspiron is on of the cheaper notebooks made by Dell.</strong></p>

<p>Dell can offer lowest prices on notebooks as this was one of the first computer brands to ship direct to the consumer and although in 2011 there are a few exceptions, your Dell notebook comes straight from Dell, eliminating any costs that resellers add  to notebook computer. This results in some of the cheapest notebooks available today. Over the years Dell has grown to sell everything from dell branded HDTV’s to desktop computers, but some of the core reasons to shop for a dell is for their affordable inspiron notebooks like the 15 inch dell notebook on sale pictured above.</p>

<div style="float: right; margin-right: 5px;">
</div>

<div style="float: right; margin-right: 5px;">
</div>

<p>Very carefully.</p>

<p>In some ways I joke because as long as you <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3918">follow the instructions</a> on iMac 27 inch RAM upgrade instructions as provided by Apple that won’t void your warranty in any way and make your iMac run faster for cheaper than you have ever imagined you’ll be absolutely fine as adding iMac 27 inch RAM isn’t complicated or difficult at all.</p>

<p>On the other side of the coin, adding memory to you Mac does require some precautions as there is a slim chance you could zap not only the RAM upgrade you’re trying to install but your Apple iMac too, and that my friends, is not a good idea or something I recommend. The biggest precaution you have to make when it comes to iMac RAM upgrades is to fight against static electricity when installing the memory.</p>

<p>As you will see with the Apple Memory Upgrade Installation  Instructions, upgrading RAM on the 27 inch iMac is pretty easy and once you remove the cover on the bottom of the iMac you have full access to the memory upgrade slots that can accept up to 16GB of RAM using four 4 GB DDR3 SDRAM 133 MHz sodimms.</p>

<p>It’s just a matter of removing the factory RAM from the iMac, which is usually formatted in 2x2GB or 2×4 GB memory configurations and installing more memory in the empty two upgrade slots on the 27 inch iMac. If your iMac came shipped with 8GB of RAM in a 2x4GB configuration, this means you have two more empty memory upgrade slots where you can buy and install another two 4GB imac memory module and effectively doubling and maximizing the RAM your iMac uses.</p>

<p><strong>Where to Buy iMac 27 inch RAM</strong></p>

<p>I monitor ram prices for Apple iMac 27 inch computers from a variety of memory manufacturers and vendors so  I suggest this to be a good place to start when shopping for deals on iMac RAM as the other thing you have to be aware of is paying too much money for you iMac RAM as you  have worked hard for that money and you want to maximize not only the iMac’s RAM but also the savings on RAM.</p>

<p>With that in mind, below are the cheapest Apple iMac 27 inch memory upgrades on sale currently:</p>

<p>[table id=2 /]</p>

<p>Memory Installations on the Apple 27 inch iMac are cheap and easy to do yourself with common sense and household tools and will make your iMac computing experience a joy for years to come.</p>

<p>What is the best computer 2011? (I also get asked what is the best 2011 laptop too)</p>

<p>I get asked this a fair bit, probably just behind what the best computers 2011 offers and what should I buy which is another thing I get asked, so rather than answer this question again privately,  I thought  I would answer your question here and look at the Top 3 HP desktop computers on sale and why they are the best desktops from HP you can buy this year to date:<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004G5ZTJW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004G5ZTJW"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1613" style="border-style: initial; border-color: initial;" title="Best HP Desktop" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-31-at-2.03.19-PM.png" alt="Cheapest HP Desktop " width="504" height="468" /></a></p>

<p>The HP Pavilion currently tops the best selling HP desktops list as it balances the low price that all desktop PC’s are associated with when compared to days gone by but still offers the best performance of any other desktop computer by HP. Featuring an AMD Phenom II 840T Quad-Core Processor with 6GB of RAM standard (expandable to 16GB), a 1TB hard drive for more than enough room for your files, and Windows 7 64 bit operating system installed with a fast ATI RadeonTM HD 4200 integrated graphics card  that offers fast and responsive video – great for movies or gaming, just two applications that require the fastest video card money can buy. Priced at just a touch over $500 this is the best value desktop from HP available today.</p>

<h1 id="hp-pavilion-slimline-s5710f-pc3"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004G5ZSXO/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004G5ZSXO">HP Pavilion Slimline s5710f PC</a></h1>

<p>The HP Pavilion Slimline S5710f  comes in a much smaller form factor than a full sized PC but don’t let the small size or even smaller price fool you. This is one serious  HP desktop PC and ships standard with an AMD Athlon II 260 Dual Core Processor, 3GB of DDR3 RAM, 640GB hard drive, and Windows 7 all come as standard equipment on this tiny PC from HP that looks stylish on any desk, a perfect solution from HP where space is a consideration when buying a desktop PC, regardless of computer brand.</p>

<p>The HP Pavilion P6750 Special Edition is priced with a street price of just over $500 and offers a stylish ocean inspired design for spaces where it matters that your desktop looks as much as it performs. This HP desktop is not all about looks, no this is one of the top 3 computers today from HP thanks to a fast Intel E6700 processor,  Windows 7 64bit pre-installed and 4GB of RAM or Memory  with a big 1TB hard drive as standard equipment and all for a low low price that’s too low to display here it’s such a great deal on a HP Desktop.</p>

<p>HP desktop technology will increase over time, and the desktops will get even faster  with more performance as they always do, but when shopping for a HP desktop this year in 2011 these are the best HP desktops available today.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2011/03/is-applecare-for-a-2011-macbook-pro-worth-it/">Is AppleCare Worth It for A MacBook Pro?</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-31-at-3.51.55-PM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1621" title="Best Deal on AppleCare" alt="Cheap Apple Care " src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-31-at-3.51.55-PM.png" width="304" height="329" /></a></p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>MacBook Pro Applecare. </strong></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004R6NWBC/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004R6NWBC">Save on AppleCare for MacBook Pro. </a></strong></p>

<p>This is a good question, and at $250 for another 2 years of limited warranty and almost 3 years of phone support some may argue that AppleCare is the best value no nonsense Apple warranty you can buy, while others might tend to think it’s the biggest waste of money possible and you would be much better off self insuring your new MacBook Pro yourself.</p>

<p>First off, let’s forget about the telephone support as I think for a professional notebook buyer this is waste of time. You’re buying a pro notebook  from Apple  so I’m going to assume you know how to use the thing, or at very least you know how to use the tools with your MacBook Pro whether  they are Adobe Photoshop  for graphics pros or Microsoft Office for business professionals, it’s highly unlikely you’ll use the phone support. At least I never have and with  every new Mac I have ever bought, I just unwrap or unbox the Mac and get to work.</p>

<p>The limited warranty is the kicker I think.  On  one  hand you could argue that the one year warranty that ships with every Mac is more than enough for finding out if you’ve got a dud of a Mac as that’s a year of bumps and bruises and reboots and restarts and there is going to be a problem with your new Apple notebook, it would have reared it’s ugly head by now.</p>

<p>On the other side of the argument, $250 for another 2 years of warranty is a pretty good deal and assuming this is a business computer the AppleCare might be considered a cost of doing business resulting in tax writeoff or refund and even if it isn’t in your case, ten dollars a month for Apple Warranty seems like a pretty good deal for the additional warranty and when you consider that AppleCare only adds another ten percent to your total MacBook Pro cost, give or take – the AppleCare for MacBook Pro seems like a no brainer.</p>

<p>I’ve never bothered with AppleCare for MacBook Pro, as even though a MacBook Pro should get you through three years  or so before you start lusting for a faster Mac, I tend to just trade my old MacBook Pro in for a newer  Mac notebook. My approach is this:</p>

<p>New MacBook Pro Price: $2500.</p>

<p>MacBook Pro traded in a year later for $1000.</p>

<p>This means I now have a $1000 credit for my brand new next generation MacBook Pro with another year  of AppleCare warranty included without having to buy AppleCare ever. Yes, it costs me $1500 for the year I have the current  MBP, but  I earn much more money with my MacBook Pro than $100 or  so a month, so I don’t care and I get a new MacBook Pro every year without having to buy additional AppleCare and  I would rather put the $125 a year to newer technology which allows me  to work even faster than before, another added benefit of this approach. Buying more insurance does not get my work done any faster.</p>

<p>Essentially, by opting out of buying AppleCare and just replacing my Mac every year when the warranty is up I have no need for AppleCare. The downside  of this approach is I’m losing $1500 per year (estimated) by doing this and keeping  my MacBook Pro for longer than a year would definitely be the more frugal choice, even with the added costs of Apple. Assuming I kept my MacBook Pro for three years – the same length of time as the AppleCare coverage and the MacBook Pro was entirely worthless at the end of those 36 month, my total yearly cost for my MacBook Pro, including the extended warranty of the AppleCare would be about $800 per year</p>

<p>If saving money on your computer purchases is your main concern, then AppleCare is the best deal as it allows you to extend the life of your MBP knowing you’ve got full limited warranty coverage from Apple. The downside to this is approach is that your Apple Notebook will be pretty slow when you compare it to newer models at the time.</p>

<p>If you prefer to use a new MacBook Pro year after year, then buying AppleCare for MacBook Pro is not worth it as it’s not needed. Every year when you buy a new MacBook Pro will come with AppleCare included. The downside to this method is you will be hit with high depreciation costs when it comes time to trade in your MacBook Pro at the end of the first year and your total computing costs will be significantly higher.</p>

<p>You have to decide what route suits your needs best when it comes to <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004R6NWBC/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004R6NWBC">buying extended warranty coverage for your Mac</a></strong>.</p>

If your budget for an SSD hard drive is under $100 then this hard drive from Seagate might be the solution for those that can’t justify the high prices SSD hard drives still demand</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003NE5JCE/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B003NE5JCE">OCZ Technology Vertex 2 60GB</a></strong></p>

<p>The OCZ Technology Vertex 2 60GB SSD drive offers an affordable way to  enter the still pricey SSD hard drive category.

<p>Above are the top five SSD hard drives on sale in 2011 and offer much more affordable or cheaper SSD hard drive prices than what was available in 2011 as SSD prices continue to drop this year thanks in part to more demand and also as the SSD hard drive technology matures.</p>

<p>I can happily answer this question on <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/where-to-buy-computer-memory-upgrades/">where to get a good price on dell computer memory</a></strong> , but seeing as you didn’t specify whether you were looking for an upgrade on either your  Dell desktop computer or your Dell notebook, I’m going to hazard a guess and answer this as you were looking for <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">cheap 8GB for Dell notebooks </a></strong>as these notebook computers tend  to be the best selling computers you can buy from Dell in 2011.</p>

<p>Which <strong>Dell Notebook</strong>?<a style="line-height: 18px;" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004K1EQO6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004K1EQO6"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1588" title="Cheapest Dell Inspiron" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-30-at-2.53.23-PM.png" alt="Cheap Dell Notebook RAM" width="575" height="470" /></a></p>

</p>

<p>Now it’s time for me to ask questions. You didn’t tell me what computer model from Dell you specifically wanted  to upgrade when it comes to <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="dell memory upgrades">Dell memory upgrades</a> so let’s assume you want to upgrade one of the most popular Dell notebooks on sale that will accept 8GB of RAM. This  would be the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26scn%3D565108%26redirect%3Dtrue%26ref_%3Dsr_nr_scat_565108_ln%26keywords%3Ddell%2520inspiron%2520notebook%26qid%3D1301511039%26h%3Db229a1013fc0d38cc632a26a668c5de4f28c061c%26rh%3Dn%253A565108%252Ck%253Adell%2520inspiron%2520notebook&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">Dell Inspiron Notebook</a>, and though it ships standard from Dell with just <strong>4GB of memory installed in this Dell Notebook</strong>, the RAM can be  upgraded to 8GB effectively  doubling the RAM on this particular Dell notebook.</p>

<p>**Where to Buy Cheap Dell Memory Upgrades **</p>

<p><strong>**I have created a great list of all the memory stores you could buy memory upgrades for Dell computers from and these are all great places to **buy RAM for Dell computers</strong> (and many other computer brands too – not just Dell) . One of the best things about buying RAM from one of the vendors I list here is that you can be sure that all the <strong>RAM upgrades you buy for your Dell</strong> – 8GB or otherwise – will be that the <strong>total cost for Dell memory</strong> will be much cheaper thanks to the fact that Dell charges more for RAM in most instances than if you were to do a bit of shopping online and buy memory upgrades from a trusted memory source. The other reason is that with most <strong>memory stores specializing in Dell RAM</strong> you can save more money on RAM for Dells as you have the option to buy both the cheaper generic RAM for Dell, or if you prefer you can buy brand name  Dell memory upgrades but be aware that this  will cost you more than thew Generic RAM.  A few name brand memory manufacturers for Dell memory include <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">Crucial</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26scn%3D172500%26redirect%3Dtrue%26ref_%3Dsr_nr_scat_172500_ln%26keywords%3Dkingston%2520memory%26qid%3D1301510761%26h%3D6518adcfc6bf51d5edefa8705761def90a1da114%26rh%3Dn%253A172500%252Ck%253Akingston%2520memory&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">Kingston</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26x%3D0%26ref_%3Dnb_sb_noss%26y%3D0%26field-keywords%3Dcorsair%2520memory%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">Corsair</a>.</p>

<p><strong>It costs nothing to install memory if you install the  RAM yourself. </strong>For all but a few PC models  there’s no reason that with some common sense, a bit of research online for memory install instructions for your particular computer brand and model  and you can install ram yourself without the added expense of bringing your computer in to a computer store or computer service center.</p>

<p>When in comes time to install memory on a desktop computer or notebooks, most ram upgrade installations can be done in ten minutes or less with the biggest problem you may encounter when installing memory being static electricity as memory for both notebook and desktops tend to be fragile and very sensitive when it comes to static electricity.</p>

<p>All you need to do to prevent the memory or your computer against static electricity is to ground yourself properly either by touching a metal part on your computer chassis to discharge any electricity you may have built up in (or  is it on?) you.  A better defense against static is to <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref_%3Dnb_sb_ss_i_0_23%26field-keywords%3Danti%2520static%2520wrist%2520strap%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps%26sprefix%3Danti%2520static%2520wrist%2520strap&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">buy an anti-static wrist strap</a></strong> to ground yourself against any damage to your new RAM. This sounds like a big deal but in the 15 years I have been dealing with RAM I have never fried a stick of RAM using the precautions  I have mentioned.</p>

<p>Installing your memory upgrades depends on your particular model.  For an example,  <a href="http://support.dell.com/support/edocs/systems/ins1525/en/SM/memory.htm#wp1180987" title="dell memory installation">installing memory on a Dell 1525 Inspiron</a> notebook consists of nothing more than removing eight screws on the bottom of the Dell notebook to get at the memory upgrade slots, removing the factory RAM installed by Dell  and replacing them with the  larger memory modules that you have bought, and then simply fasten the door on the bottom of the notebook again.</p>

<p>Installing RAM on Apple Notebooks pretty much works the same: In the case of installing MacBook Pro memory you do <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1270#link1">pretty much the same </a>, except in the case of the Apple laptop you remove the entire bottom of  the laptop  instead of a small door on the back like you do with the Dell.</p>

<p>Desktop RAM installs are just as easy, if not more thanks to the fact that there’s more room to work with. Simply  unplug your desktop and all cables, remove the cover on your PC and lay the  PC chassis on it’s side where you will have easy access to the motherboard on your PC to access all the memory upgrade memory slots for your personal computer.</p>

<p>Tools required for memory installs usually just require a small philips screwdriver, or in rare cases a torx screwdriver and the anti static strap  mentioned earlier.</p>

<p>Short Answer: You’re better off just <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW">buying cheap MacBook Pro RAM</a></strong> than interchanging RAM upgrades.</p>

<p>The answer to the question on whether you can <strong>swap out the RAM from an Apple iMac to an Apple MacBook Pro</strong> depends on what specific <strong>Apple iMac</strong> and what specific <strong>Apple MacBook Pro</strong> you want to change or switch the memory from as all <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="macbook pro ram upgrades">MacBook Pro ram upgrades</a> are not the same as all <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/iMac_(DDR3_1333)/" title="iMac RAM Upgrades">iMac memory upgrades,</a> so you need to be very specific what exact Apple model you wish to perform this task with, as the  answer to this could depend:Yes or No.</p>

<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1580" title="Buy cheap MacBook Pro RAM" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-30-at-1.31.36-PM.png" alt="Buy RAM for MacBook Pro " width="310" height="218" />I  guess my first question is considering the <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="cheap apple memory">cheap price of Apple Memory</a></strong> these days and that for both the <strong>Apple iMac and the MacBook Pro RAM is so cheap</strong>, why don’t you just <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory">buy more Macbook Pro memory</a></strong> and be done with it. As I see it, you want to <strong>remove RAM from Apple iMac</strong> and <strong>Install RAM on MacBook Pro</strong> but my question is <strong>why</strong>?</p>

<p>This will leave you with an <strong>Apple iMac with too little RAM,</strong> or at very least not enough ram or less RAM than you had  before in the iMac and  <strong>more RAM in the MacBo0k Pro</strong>. I don’t recommend this and really except for  a few rare instances (16GB for MBP)  and bigger ram upgrades for Mac Pro – all <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/news/apple">Apple memory upgrades</a></strong> should for the most part ship for under $100 for 8GB of RAM which not the maximum RAM on either machines, sounds to me like a better idea than what you’ve got planned.</p>

<p>But yes (<strong>again, I don’t recommend this.  Do so at your own risk..etc</strong>) if you want to or need to <strong>swap RAM from an iMac to MacBook Pro</strong> you can, but you have to pay attention to the speed of memory in both machines. In the case of the <strong>latest iMacs which were announced summer 2010</strong> and the MacBook Pros just announced last month, these two do accept DDR3 SDRAM sodimms that could (have I mentioned I don’t recommend this?) be swapped from an iMac to a MacBook Pro.</p>

<p>You’re much better off <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW">buying new RAM for the MacBook Pro</a></strong> and leaving the  RAM inside the Apple iMac</p>

    <h1><a href="/2011/03/how-to-get-the-best-price-on-a-macbook-from-apple/">How To Get the Best Price on a MacBook  from Apple</a></h1>

<div style="float: right; margin-right: 5px;">
</div>

<p>Oddly enough, if you’re in the market to buy a a new MacBook, if  you want to get a good deal on a MacBook you can do much better on  the price if you <strong>do not buy  the MacBook from  Apple</strong> and  <strong>buy a MacBook from Amazon</strong> instead. When you buy the MacBook at the Apple Store you get to pay full list price for your MacBook, and in the age of the internet where **deals on Apple Macs **are just  a click away, why would you buy  a Mac from Apple when you can buy it less than the $999 MSRP somewhere else</p>

<p> </p>

<p>I like Amazon when <strong>buying Apple products</strong> as they offer bundles and special offers on not only your MacBook  but Mac accessories like Apple Displays, Mice, external keyboards and even <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/">MacBook RAM upgrades</a>.<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1600" title="Cheapest MacBook " src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-30-at-5.31.00-PM.png" alt="Best Price MacBook" width="303" height="243" /></p>

<p>At the time I write this, Amazon offers a **MacBook Bundle **that consists of the MacBook at a discount, but also Microsoft Office and AppleCare for your Macbook is also offered at a much cheaper price than had you bought the MacBook Pro.</p>

<p>Apple does offer refurbished MacBooks for less than what you would pay for a new MacBook, but you are not  buying a new MacBook but pre-owned MacBook or refurb, which might be a better price than a new MacBook, you might be buying problems rather than a deal, whereas if you stick with a new MacBook that’s priced well under the $999 MSRP from Apple you deal with what is probably one of the better vendors online regardless of what manufacturer you want, not just Apple.</p>

<p>Of course, when it comes time to get the <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_(1066_DDR3)/">best price on RAM for your new Apple MacBook</a></strong> you’re already at the right place, and I can recommend many memory sellers that can offer deals on Apple RAM too.</p>

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>[table id=1 /]</p>

<p>But I’m going to assume that when you ask what the <strong>difference is between 4GB of RAM for MacBook Pro and <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_Pro_DDR3_1333Mhz_Memory_Upgrade_Kits-8gb/">8GB of MacBook RAM</a></strong> it’s due to the fact that you’re talking about the <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/">best prices for MacBook Memory</a></strong> and you want to know <strong>what RAM you should buy for your MacBook Pro</strong> and whether it’s worth the added cost to make the upgrade from 4GB  to 8GB, or if you really need to upgrade the MacBook Pro then <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_Pro_DDR3_1333Mhz_Memory_Upgrade_Kits-16gb/">16GB of MacBook Pro Memory</a></strong>, but this last option is still very pricey with a street price of $1600 – almost the same as the cost of the <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I">cheapest MacBook Pro</a></strong> – the Apple 13 inch MacBook Pro.<strong>4GB, Obviously.</strong></p>

<p>[table id=15 /]</p>

<p>As all <strong>currently shipping MacBook Pros</strong> come out of the box with 4GB of memory already installed you really can only consider the <strong>8GB Apple MacBook Pro Memory Upgrade Kits</strong> consisting of two 4GB DDR3 SDRAM 1333Mhz so-dimms to be the only upgrade option when it comes to <strong>uprading your MPB with more RAM</strong>.</p>

<p>When it comes to pricing differences between <strong>4GB for Apple MacBook Pro Memory</strong> the cost difference is about half and rather than tell you a price on <strong>MacBook Pro RAM,</strong> that will be outdated by the time  you read this article, I’ll show you instead as the ram prices for MacBook Pros below are constantly updated so you can always get the best price on Apple MacBook Pro memory upgrades:</p>

<p><strong>Best MacBook Pro RAM Prices</strong></p>

<p>A MacBook Pro RAM Upgrade is one of the cheapest, easiest upgrades you can perform on your professional Mac notebook and with 8GB RAM for MacBook Pro available for under $100, this is a pretty easy upgrade to consider. I recommend it.</p>
