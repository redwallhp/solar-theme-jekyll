<p><strong>Not Yet.  You can’t buy 32GB MacBook Pro Memory Upgrades</strong></p>

<p>The most memory you can install is 16GB into a current Apple MacBook Pro . The Apple MacBook Pro’s available on sale in 2013 max out at 16GB of RAMThis applies to all Apple MacBook Pros currently available online for sale:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Apple MacBook Pro 13-inch: 2.5GHz</li>
  <li>Apple MacBook Pro 13-inch: 2.9GHz</li>
  <li>Apple MacBook Pro 13-inch: 2.5GHz with Retina display</li>
  <li>Apple MacBook Pro 13-inch: 2.6GHz with Retina display</li>
  <li>Apple MacBook Pro 15-inch: 2.3GHz</li>
  <li>Apple Macbook Pro 15-inch: 2.4GHz with Retina display</li>
  <li>Apple MacBook Pro 15-inch: 2.7GHz with Retina display</li>
</ul>

<p>I wonder: will the maximum RAM upgrades you can install in any MacBook Pro will stop at 16GB. I guess it’s time to come to ask the question: <strong>How much ram do you need? </strong></p>

<p>The Apple MacBook Air models don’t even come with upgradable ram upgrades. If you buy a MacBook Air and want the most ram you can install in it  you better be ready to buy an 8GB MacBook Air because if you don’t you’re stuck with the 4GB option which leaves you little ram left over once you get the MacOS up and running. That said, small screens and 4GB of RAM seem to be a popular choice with Apple customers, especially if the MacBook Air is the secondary or light use computer. (another option would be to buy a chromebook)</p>

<p><strong>Apple MacBook Pro Memory Price Increases</strong></p>

<p>Also, RAM for Apple MacBook Pros have close to doubled in recent months. This is one of the very few memory price increases I have seen in the 15 years I have been monitoring ram prices for Apple computers. Usually, ram prices for Apple computer have always dropped in price over time.This is a first.</p>

<p>At current ram prices, the cheapest 16GB RAM for MacBook Pro you can buy  is about $125.00.  This means if you were to buy 32GB MacBook Pro RAM it’s quite possible that the price would be double that if not more with 32GB MacBook Pro memory costing as much as $250.00 to $300 or even more. And god forbid if you buy the memory from the Apple Store, as this option will <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/do-i-have-to-buy-memory-ram-from-apple/" title="Do I Have To Buy Memory RAM From Apple?">cost you much much more</a>.</p>

<p>A MacBook Pro with 32GB would be a pricey notebook computer. Assuming the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0074703CM/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0074703CM&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=ramseeker-20">best price you can get on a 13 inch MacBook Pro is about $1100.00 </a>, and adding 32GB MacBook Pro RAM costing you say $300, the cheapest MacBook Pro maxed out with 32Gb of RAM could cost you close to $1500.00, and if you upgrade to the Apple MacBook Pro 15-inch: 2.7GHz with Retina display you’d be north of 3 grand with 32GB of RAM installed.</p>

<p>This all assumes that ram prices for MacBook Pros stay stable too. If you start adding RAM later it might even cost you more. Now if you’ve got deep pockets or need the fastest MacBook Pro money can buy, then the price for 32GB of RAM for MacBook Pro is not much at all, especially if you use your MacBook Pro for photo or video editing you need the fastest MacBook Pro you can buy and the price of RAM or the MacBook Pro might not matter at all because you’re making money with your MacBook Pro.</p>

<p><strong>Sell Your Factory Installed MacBook Pro RAM</strong></p>

<p>One thing that might help offset the cost of 32GB would be to<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/where-can-i-sell-old-ram/" title="Where Can I Sell Old RAM?"> sell your old ram</a> that came with the MacBook Pro in the first place. Let’s say you’ve got 16GB of RAM from your MacBook Pro installed from the Apple directly. You could remove the ram and trade it for 32GB MBP ram. You won’t get a whole lot for the old ram but there’s many memory vendors that will allow you to trade in your old ram for larger memory upgrade modules effectively lowering the price you have to pay for the bigger ram for your MacBook Pro.</p>

<p><strong>You’re Going To Have To Wait for 32GB MacBook Pro RAM</strong></p>

<p>I don’t know any memory store that sells 32GB for MacBook Pro just yet. There’s MacBook Pro rumors that a 2013 refresh of the MacBook Pro’s could happen at WWDC later this summer but like all Apple rumors, that’s all it is at this time – a rumor.</p>

<p>Of course,<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/apple-macintosh-memory-16gb-macbook-pro-ram/" title="MacBook Pro 16GB RAM Upgrades"> just like I did with 16GB of RAM</a> I’ll let you know when 32GB of RAM for MacBook Pros does come available and of course I will find the lowest price you can pay for 32GB MacBook Pro Memory</p>

<br>

		<div class="post-content">When buying <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com">memory upgrades for your notebook</a> it's often because you <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Best-Sellers-Electronics-Laptop-Computers/zgbs/electronics/565108/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;tag=ramseeker-20">bought a brand new laptop for 2013</a></strong> at least, that's usually when I personally buy RAM because I want the fastest computer when the computer is brand new and not wait until the computer gets old and slower when compared to newer computer models, regardless of brand.
<h2>Best Laptop Computer Brands for 2013</h2>
In 2013 as smartphones and and tablets increase market share, you might think that the notebook computer is dead, but this is not the case because even though tablets and phones increase in popularity nothing can beat typing on a real and physical keyboard and a notebook computer is  the only portable computing device that offers such. With that in mind, here's a look at some of the best manufacturers of notebook computers for this year, in 2013.
<h2>Google</h2>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009LL9VDG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B009LL9VDG&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=ramseeker-20"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7231" alt="Notebook Deal under $400" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Screen-Shot-2013-02-13-at-9.38.09-AM-600x455.png" width="600" height="455" /></a>

New to the list of best selling notebooks this year when compared to last year is Google, with their line of notebook computers called chromebooks. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009LL9VDG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B009LL9VDG&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=ramseeker-20"><strong>Google offers some of the best selling notebooks</strong></a> this year thanks to the fact that these are the cheapest notebook computers you can buy. Take the Samsung ChromeBook for an example. At $249.00, you get an 11 inch notebook for 2013 that runs on the Google Chrome OS and offers excellent portable computing value for the price.

Some may argue that the Chromebook isn't a real notebook computer when compared to Dell or HP or other notebook brands but that's because you can't run traditional applications on it like you can on a Windows based notebook computer. But with the flexibility and price the chrome OS offers thanks to Google Drive applications and the popularity of blogging sites or software that don't require any applications but offer all work to be done online or in the cloud the chromebook is  an excellent notebook for the price and is small and light enough to be carried with you everywhere yet still offers USB ports, a full sized keyboard and a bright 11 inch LED display, it's no wonder that the chromebooks for 2013 are the best selling notebook computer brands in 2013 so far this year.

<h2>Apple</h2>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009LL9VDG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B009LL9VDG&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=ramseeker-20"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7048" alt="macbookprobig" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/macbookprobig.png" width="480" height="350" /></a>

On the other end of the spectrum when comparing Apple notebooks to Google notebooks, you get one of the best selling computer brands this year, but at a price. The cheapest price for a notebook from Apple will cost you close to $1000, if not more, depending on what model you buy. The MacBook Air is what one might consider a direct competitor to the Google Chromebook when it comes to screen size (the 11 inch MacBook Air) but the OS is much more advanced on the Macintosh OS than if you were to buy a Chromebook. Google wants you to primarily to work in the cloud, while the MacBook is more of  a traditional PC. The advantages of the Apple notebooks vs Chromebooks is the OS and the available software. Faster processors and more RAM are also a distinct advantage of an Apple Macbook Air or MacBook Pro and if you've got other Apple products such as iPhones or iPods, they all work together without fuss or problems. Apple offers a high end solution for portable computing and charges a premium for the tight integration of hardware and software in Apple notebooks.

Dell has long been a price leader when it comes to buying a cheap notebook online and in 2013, this hasn't changed and their 2013 Dell Inspiron notebooks always tend to be one of the best selling notebooks of the year. The 15 inch Dell Inspiron is one example of a best selling notebook computer from Dell. Compared to the price of an Apple MacBook Pro, the Dell Inspiron is an absolute bargain at under $400.00 on sale for a full featured 15 inch notebook with a fast Intel Core i3 processor, 6gb of RAM and a 500GB hard drive all standard. The Inspiron also features one of the bigger displays when compared to the Apple or Google offerings with a 15.4 inch display. Windows 7 Home Premium is included for the price and you can upgrade to Windows 8 very inexpensively too if you feel the need.  There was a time when an under $500 notebook from Dell would be considered an absolute bargain but with notebook prices dropping over time thanks to cheaper components inside a Dell notebook you don't need to look too hard to get a great deal on a Dell notebook in 2013.

<h2>Toshiba</h2>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00B3PLPEQ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00B3PLPEQ&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=ramseeker-20"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7233" alt="Toshiba notebook under $400" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Screen-Shot-2013-02-13-at-10.01.22-AM-600x397.png" width="600" height="397" /></a>

Despite the fact that Toshiba has the very worst naming conventions on their notebook PC's with long model numbers instead of memorable names like the other manufacturers of notebooks above, you should consider buying a Toshiba notebook in 2013 due to the fact that the folks at Toshiba make a very good high quality product. You can buy cheaper notebooks to be sure (Acer comes to mind) but when in the market for  a higher quality notebook at a great price don't hesitate to consider Toshiba notebook. Take the<strong> Toshiba Satellite C855D-S5320 </strong>for example.<strong>  With a street price of under $400 </strong>this is a great deal on a notebook for 2013. There's not too many under $400 notebook computers you can buy today that offers the quality you can expect from Toshiba. This particular model of Toshiba notebook features a E-Series Dual-Core E2-1800 1.7 GHz processor with a 15.6 inch display, Windows 8 and 4GB of RAM with a 500GB hard drive.

<h2>Lenovo</h2>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ATANVMA/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00ATANVMA&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=ramseeker-20"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7240" alt="Screen Shot 2013-02-26 at 4.41.33 PM" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Screen-Shot-2013-02-26-at-4.41.33-PM-600x407.png" width="600" height="407" /></a>

Lenovo is a relatively new notebook computer brand but if you look closely at the Lenovo brand you will see that this brand is really a subsidy of IBM, a name in computing that dates back decades, so you can rest assured you are buying a quality product when you are considering the Lenovo brand. Offering a top ten notebook for 2013 is not easy in the notebook shopping landscape with so many deals being available for a notebook computer this year. Lenovo offers a sub $500 notebook computer in the form of the Lenovo G580 notebook that offers a 15.6 inch display and comes with a fast Intel Core i3 processor, 4GB of RAM with a 500GB hard drive and Windows 8 pre-installed.

<span style="font-size: 13px;">These are but a few of the best selling notebooks you can buy for 2013 and this list will change over the course of the year and I will do my best to keep this list updated but when shopping for a new notebook this year from some of the best brands, some models have a very short lifespan and replacements will soon be available so that's why I recommend you keep an eye on the best selling notebooks of 2013 available </span>

Lenovo is a relatively new notebook computer brand but if you look closely at the Lenovo brand you will see that this brand is really a subsidy of IBM, a name in computing that dates back decades, so you can rest assured you are buying a quality product when you are considering the Lenovo brand. Offering a top ten notebook for 2013 is not easy in the notebook shopping landscape with so many deals being available for a notebook computer this year.

When buying <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com">memory upgrades for your notebook</a> it's often because you <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Best-Sellers-Electronics-Laptop-Computers/zgbs/electronics/565108/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;tag=ramseeker-20">bought a brand new laptop for 2013</a></strong> at least, that's usually when I personally buy RAM because I want the fastest computer when the computer is brand new and not wait until the computer gets old and slower when compared to newer computer models, regardless of brand.
<h2>Best Laptop Computer Brands for 2013</h2>
In 2013 as smartphones and and tablets increase market share, you might think that the notebook computer is dead, but this is not the case because even though tablets and phones increase in popularity nothing can beat typing on a real and physical keyboard and a notebook computer is  the only portable computing device that offers such. With that in mind, here's a look at some of the best manufacturers of notebook computers for this year, in 2013.
<h2>Google</h2>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009LL9VDG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B009LL9VDG&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=ramseeker-20"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7231" alt="Notebook Deal under $400" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Screen-Shot-2013-02-13-at-9.38.09-AM-600x455.png" width="600" height="455" /></a>

New to the list of best selling notebooks this year when compared to last year is Google, with their line of notebook computers called chromebooks. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009LL9VDG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B009LL9VDG&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=ramseeker-20"><strong>Google offers some of the best selling notebooks</strong></a> this year thanks to the fact that these are the cheapest notebook computers you can buy. Take the Samsung ChromeBook for an example. At $249.00, you get an 11 inch notebook for 2013 that runs on the Google Chrome OS and offers excellent portable computing value for the price.

Some may argue that the Chromebook isn't a real notebook computer when compared to Dell or HP or other notebook brands but that's because you can't run traditional applications on it like you can on a Windows based notebook computer. But with the flexibility and price the chrome OS offers thanks to Google Drive applications and the popularity of blogging sites or software that don't require any applications but offer all work to be done online or in the cloud the chromebook is  an excellent notebook for the price and is small and light enough to be carried with you everywhere yet still offers USB ports, a full sized keyboard and a bright 11 inch LED display, it's no wonder that the chromebooks for 2013 are the best selling notebook computer brands in 2013 so far this year.

On the other end of the spectrum when comparing Apple notebooks to Google notebooks, you get one of the best selling computer brands this year, but at a price. The cheapest price for a notebook from Apple will cost you close to $1000, if not more, depending on what model you buy. The MacBook Air is what one might consider a direct competitor to the Google Chromebook when it comes to screen size (the 11 inch MacBook Air) but the OS is much more advanced on the Macintosh OS than if you were to buy a Chromebook. Google wants you to primarily to work in the cloud, while the MacBook is more of  a traditional PC. The advantages of the Apple notebooks vs Chromebooks is the OS and the available software. Faster processors and more RAM are also a distinct advantage of an Apple Macbook Air or MacBook Pro and if you've got other Apple products such as iPhones or iPods, they all work together without fuss or problems. Apple offers a high end solution for portable computing and charges a premium for the tight integration of hardware and software in Apple notebooks.

Dell has long been a price leader when it comes to buying a cheap notebook online and in 2013, this hasn't changed and their 2013 Dell Inspiron notebooks always tend to be one of the best selling notebooks of the year. The 15 inch Dell Inspiron is one example of a best selling notebook computer from Dell. Compared to the price of an Apple MacBook Pro, the Dell Inspiron is an absolute bargain at under $400.00 on sale for a full featured 15 inch notebook with a fast Intel Core i3 processor, 6gb of RAM and a 500GB hard drive all standard. The Inspiron also features one of the bigger displays when compared to the Apple or Google offerings with a 15.4 inch display. Windows 7 Home Premium is included for the price and you can upgrade to Windows 8 very inexpensively too if you feel the need.  There was a time when an under $500 notebook from Dell would be considered an absolute bargain but with notebook prices dropping over time thanks to cheaper components inside a Dell notebook you don't need to look too hard to get a great deal on a Dell notebook in 2013.

    <h1><a href="/2013/01/where-to-buy-windows-7-ram/">Where To Buy Windows 7 RAM</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>When you’re in the market for a brand new computer in 2013 most all computer buyers this year will tend to be buyers of notebook computers or even tablet computers, but both of those options may not be the best computer of 2013 for you. With a brand new laptop this year it will come equipped with a default install of Windows 8. Many say that Windows 8 is better than Windows 7 when you compare the two versions of Windows you can still buy today. (Why anyone would want to buy Vista is beyond me).</p>

<p>Despite the new Metro design and features offered by Windows 8, some (like me) actually prefer to stick with Windows 7. Why? Because it’s familiar. I still cannot get used to the new user interface of Windows 8, even if it is considered to be a better Windows operating system. Yes, you could install Windows 7 on a Windows 8 notebook, but then you will have to download Windows 7 from Amazon or some other online retailer that sells Windows 7 and this will cost you at least $100 or so. You’re better off keeping your older Windows 7 notebook and adding more memory to the notebook you have rather than try to install Windows 7 on a PC designed for Windows 8</p>

<p>Adding more memory to your PC running Windows 7 offers a very big speed increase and the ability to run more applications simultaneously than if you were to just to stick with the standard memory configurations on most notebooks running Windows 7.  It’s easy to add more ram to a Windows 7 notebook too – all you have to do is this:</p>

<p><strong>1. Find out what Memory Type you need to buy</strong>. Most online memory stores can help with this thanks to their online memory configurator. You usually just enter your PC manufacturer, model name and you will get information on what type of memory you need to buy, what the maximum is you can install in your PC and how many memory upgrade slots you have to replace the stock ram with the new RAM.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Remove the old Factory Memory Upgrades. </strong>In most cases, you will have to remove the original RAM from the factory to install new memory upgrades. This is especially true if you are trying to upgrade a notebook computer as there are usually just two memory upgrade slots to use so you will definitely have to remove the factory ram first. With desktop computers running Windows 7, you have a bit more room as there is usually many memory slots (4 or more) and not all memory slots tend to be filled by the factory leaving you with lots of room for additional desktop memory to be installed.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>3. Install Larger Memory Modules. </strong>Once you have removed the older memory modules, and have bought the new ram upgrades for you Windows 7 computer, all you need to do is add the newer  and larger ram upgrades.</p>

<h2 id="where-to-buy-windows-7-ram">Where To Buy Windows 7 RAM</h2>

<p>Below are a few suggestions for stores that offer the best prices on Windows 7 RAM Today:</p>

    <h1><a href="/2012/12/should-you-buy-new-memory/">Should You Buy New Memory?</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>The answer, is yes.</p>

<p>The answer also is : <strong>Max out the memory on your computer with new memory.</strong> You’ll get the best performance boost that** offers more bang for dollar spent <strong>than any other upgrade you could make on your computer. Most new software (excepting freeware, shareware, or um, borrowed software) costs way more than a **new memory upgrade</strong> would cost, yet the <strong>new ram upgrade offers performance enahancements</strong> that are usually unprecedented  and will also allow you to use your** new ram to speed up your computer**. Once you’ve **added memory to your desktop or notebook computer **you will find that the new fancy software that you bought will run faster than before you added the memory.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002WE6D44/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002WE6D44">Best Selling Memory Card Today</a></strong></p>

<div>
</div>

<p><strong>Used Memory</strong>, I suppose ten years ago wasn’t as bad an idea as** memory prices for both desktop and notebook computers were much much higher** on average. Now you can get a new notebook and ** fill it with memory** for under $500 in most cases and the** performance adavantages will be higher than what used memory could be<strong>. Unless you’re a hobbyist, and are tinkering with a project where even new memory is too much money to spend, than you can search ebay/craigslist, etc for used memory.</strong> But it’s my opinion that new memory is really the only way to go **unless you’re really on a tight budget and can spend the time and make the effort for used memory. But even then, the used memory doesn’t come with any support usually.</p>

<p>For me, it’s <strong>new memory or not at all</strong>.</p>

<p>For new computers, Apple or PC. and except for the odd few configurations (8gb for the iMacs seems to be a little on the high prices, but prices are dropping) I suggest maxing out your new computer purchase right at the beginning when the computer is still new and offers the best return on your money, that’s the time you want add new memory to your Mac or PC I would think.</p>

<p>I’m writing this on a year-old plus MacBook Pro and I upgraded the memory and replaced the factory ram with new memory at a total cost of $100 to fill my Macbook with new ram. Over the year, this works out to a cost of  .27 cents per day for my new memory.</p>

<p>Some might argue that I’m biased as I track and monitor the new memory prices but it’s really hard to argue with an upgrade that costs on average  less than a quarter per day.</p>

		<div class="post-content"><h2 id="when-will-the-new-2013-macbook-air-be-released">When will the new 2013 MacBook Air Be Released?</h2>

<p>It’s now pushing December 2012 as I write this and the MacBook Air line from Apple is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;field-keywords=macbook%20air&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;url=search-alias%3Daps"><strong>now the oldest Mac you can buy today</strong></a>. iMacs, Mac Mini’s and MacBook Pros have all seen refreshes and are new. In fact, the <del><strong>2012 iMacs aren’t even shipping yet</strong></del> (update, they are here) and the 2013 MacBook Air should be the next Apple computer to be released. I hope.</p>

<p>Ultrabooks are here to stay, make no mistake and now that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009X8EB8W/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B009X8EB8W&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=ramseeker-20"><strong>PC notebooks are under $400</strong></a> and[** ultrabooks under $500<strong>]<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009RUS452/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B009RUS452&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=ramseeker-20">3</a> one has to ask themselves if it’s even worth it to buy a MacBook Air in 2013. IF you want to buy the cheapest ultrabook you can you can now **pick up a chromebook for under $250</strong>. Granted there’s lots you can’t do with a chromebook thanks to it’s OS that’s really not much more than a chrome web browser. If you need to do some serious video editing or photo editing a chromebook isn’t for you, but you must admit it’s an attractive alternativ to a MacBook Air. You could buy five chromebooks for the same price as one MacBook Air. I know that with my work it’s all web based for the most part and I think I could  make do with one. (I should buy a chromebook and test it and report back).</p>

<h2 id="is-there-a-new-macbook-air-soon">Is There a New MacBook Air Soon?</h2>

<p>I have no inside information on the workings of Apple and their future products but I see a release date of early 2013  – maybe as early as mid January. This may be a little early as the lastest MacBook Air models were released in June 2012 so that’s just seven months from the last release if I’m right. Apple may take a bit longer to finally release a new MacBook Air but early winter to early spring is a good guess, and that’s all it is: a guess.</p>

<h2 id="will-there-be-a-500-macbook-air">Will There Be a $500 MacBook Air?</h2>

<p>I don’t  think so. Apple has priced their products as high end consumer electronics rather than selling commodities like PC’s that are just the sum of their parts with Windows OS tacked on.  These windows ultrabooks  are priced at $500.00 now. Apple products have always been extraordinarily higher. Take tablets as an example: An iPad Mini  costs over $300 while android based tablets like the Nexus 7 from google or the Kindle from Amazon are priced under $200.00. I think if there’s any discount on future MacBook Air’s it will be small. There could be a small price decrease – maybe a bump both MacBook Airs down in price by $200, but again – why would Apple do this? These small and light Apple notebooks are selling in the thousand dollar price range quite nicely and have for some time. I doubt Apple would do this.</p>

<h2 id="what-new-features-will-the-new-macbook-air-have"><strong>What New Features Will the New MacBook Air Have?</strong></h2>

<p>A faster processor is a given. If nothing else, you’ll get a speed bump. I also wonder if Apple will include a lightning connector on future Apple product? I have no idea how this would be used but it’s a thought. A retinal display is probably a given, but one argument against this would be that the MacBook Air would cannibalize sales of MacBook Pros that already have retina displays.  I don’t think that Apple will really change the MacBook Air that much. There’s only so small they can make the thing and I think they are real close to being there. More RAM and bigger SSD drives are another really good possibility as both ram and SSD prices continue to drop. This might be a good way for Apple to justify the higher pricing. More RAM and more storage is always welcome</p>

<h2 id="would-i-buy-a-macbook-air-in-2013">Would I Buy a MacBook Air in 2013?</h2>

<p>I’ve lived without a MacBook Air for over five years now, and I’ll probably continue along this path. I have a relatively fast windows notebook  with Windows 8 with a lot more weight than the MacBook Air, but a much bigger screen and much cheaper. I could buy three of these notebooks for the price of one 13 inch MacBook Air. If I need to buy any notebook, I think a Google Chromebook is probably on my shopping list for any new ultrabook computer. I live in chrome and a text editor and as I type this I am listening to Pandora so I don’t even need  to store any music. I think that in 2007 a MacBook Air was a much more attractive choice for a small and light notebook, but now with release of netbooks and chromebooks and ultrabooks with Windows 8 there are much cheaper  choices for small and light computers in 2013.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2012/11/who-has-the-best-memory-scanner/">Who Has the Best Memory Scanner?</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>There’s lots of ways to find out what memory you need to buy but the best way to get the right ram for your Mac or PC (or even unix box) is to <strong>use a memory scanner. </strong>Depending on what store you buy memory from, you could be using a memory tool,memory finder, or memory software or memory configurator.</p>

<p>Some memory stores list a million products on their front page with best selling memory lists, best memory upgrade brands, and so on but almost every store offers a memory scanner to help you buy the correct memory. Most memory scanners work the same: You pick the brand, computer type and model and a program spits back of compatible memory upgrades. The scanner also offers a buch of other useful information too like the maximum memory allowed, memory banks available, memory type required and more. But, like all things in life some memory scanners are better than others  so let’s  have a look:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957"><strong>Amazon</strong></a>. Amazon may have the cheapest prices on RAM but you need to know what memory type you need. Sometimes for the Mac Memory you can search for MacBook Pro memory for an example  and you will get some results returned, but to view the entire selection you really should know what ram you need to buy before you visit Amazon. One way to find out the right ram is to read reviews on memory upgrades and check the best selling memory upgrade lists too. If everybody else is buying a particular type of RAM, you can probably do some research and see if the ram that’s selling will work in your Mac or PC.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.ramjet.com">RAMJET</a> </strong>Ramjet has had the exact same website since the mid-nineties and at one time did not have any memory selector tool at all – just links to pages but in recent years they do offer a pull down menu like the others that allow you to choose ram for popular  Macintosh computers. RAMJET does sell PC memory too but their primary focus and sales are for Macintosh memory upgrades. One area for improvement might be in the sorting – they list ram for the oldest models on the top of the page and you have to scroll for newer modeles. I would reverse this.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-1548159-10273954"><strong>Crucial Technology</strong></a></p>

<p>Crucial has in some ways almost too much choice when scanning for the right RAM. You can start with their memory configurator, use the memory scanner that scans your PC and reports on ram compatibility. Lastly, you can search for model names and I have goodl luck with that as the search engine usually offers the information I need. When Crucial finds the right ram for your PC you get info on maximum memory, memory type and memory slots available</p>

<p><a href="http://www.datamemorysystems.com"><strong>Data Memory Systems </strong></a>DMS just updated their website and now offers many more memory upgrades than before but you have to work a bit hardter to find them as you have to select type of memory (desktop, notebook etc), memory brand, memory line and  memory model. That’s a lot. But, the good news is once you find the page with your memory upgrade on it , there’s a lot of information including what the original memory is/was  in your specific computer model in addition to the maximum memory, number of memory slots available and memory type.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.oempcworld.com">OEMPCWORLD</a> </strong>is the only other computer memory store besides Crucial Technology that offers both a memory scanner and memory configurator. The configurator works just like all the others and matches your  PC to the memory type but the scanner actually scans your PC for the memory you need. It’s noted that this is a one-time scan that happens and the software doesn’t scan the contents of your hard drive – it’s more interested in your hardware than software. If you prefer to not use this for security or paranoia or both, then you can still use the memory configurator that this store offers.</p>

<p><strong>Who has the best memory scanner?</strong> If you want to have software actually scan your computer you have to choose between Crucial and OEMPCWORLD and I give the nod to Crucial due to the brand name. If you don’t want to use a system scanner to find the right memory upgrade than you’re using a memory configurator and most offer the basics such as maximum memory, memory type and  number of memory upgrade slots. A few will just match you  up with memory type and leave you on your  own to figure out the maximum ram your PC would run. I would avoid these and the memory stores I list above do a much better job of helping you buy memory for your notebook or desktop PC.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2012/11/first-look-crucial-upgrade-advisor/">First Look: Crucial Upgrade Advisor</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>Most other memory store where you can buy online call the tools they offer to help you configure your PC with more memory memory finders, memory tools or even memory configurators, but only <a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-1548159-10273954"><strong>Crucial calls theirs an ‘upgrade advisor’.</strong></a> I guess it is but you’re not asking the website what ram you use and it spits back an answer. Nope, you have to tell it all the specifics of your PC and then wait for it to match the specs with the RAM.</p>

<p>Also, if you forgo the memory advisor from Crucial you can find your ram numerous ways and one way is to visit Crucial and then select memory&gt;shop by manufacturer and select your manufacturer you will see that the best upgrades for Apple are for much older computers. I mean really? when was the last time you thought about upgrading your PowerBook G4? The ram would cost as much as you can buy the notebook on eBay. This is a missed opportunity if you ask me. I think it would do Crucial much better to promote more modern Apple memory like the new 2012 MacBook Pro’s or iMacs – memory that people are wanting to buy.</p>

<p>Quibbles aside: If you use the Crucial Upgrade Advisor you get one thing that might just trump all – and that’s a guarantee that the RAM you will buy will work – or you get to send it back for a refund (or an exchange). This is actually a great marketing scheme if you think about it: You do all the work by entering all your data (which you have to do anyway to figure out your memory) and then Crucial’s advisor spits out the RAM (and BTW tends to list the largest ram first – at least they got that right) and guarantees it will work.</p>

<p>Other stores guarantee their RAM but save for a badge or something on the bottom of their sites’ homepage their warranty isn’t something that’s promoted much, and in this area alone Crucial’s got them beat. They promote the warranty that comes with the advisor which I am sure sells more memory and yet lowers support costs. First, you enter the data so as long as you enter the right info there’s no way the advisor can mess up. A lot of computers use the exact same part so they’re just selling you the same ram regardless of PC model. And because you used the advisor from Crucial instead of just guessing there’s less chance of returns. In effect their guarantee costs very little to offer because they know the ram will work and it’s tested name brand memory. There will be very few problems when handled correctly and Crucial knows this.</p>

<p>The Crucial Upgrade Advisor is a good deal for both customers and Crucial alike. It keeps support costs low and the you know you will get the right ram for your Mac or PC, <a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-1548159-10273954"><strong>guaranteed</strong></a>.</p>

    Corsair RAM is a really good value
  </p>
</div>

<p> </p>

<p>Corsair RAM has been around for at least as long as I have been tracking memory prices, if not longer and you can buy Corsair RAM directly at <a href="http://www.corsair.com">Corsair.com </a> or from third party websites and memory resllers such as Amazon and others.</p>

<h2 id="corsair-memory-products">Corsair Memory Products</h2>

<p>Corsair ram comes in a variety of different memory types, sizes and speeds as well as selling hard drives and other PC related products such as PC cases, cooling supplies and USB flash drives, but I want to first look at the different Corsair Memory Types. Corsair memory is offered in five main computer memory types:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Intel Memory Upgrades</li>
  <li>AMD Memory Upgrades</li>
  <li>Mac Memory Upgrades</li>
  <li>Notebook Memory Upgrades</li>
</ol>

<p>These main memory types from Corsair  are also available for sale for any budget from budget memory upgrades to the most advanced memory technology available today. The Corsair memory upgrade categories are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Dominator Platinum</li>
  <li>Dominator</li>
  <li>Vengeance</li>
  <li>XMS</li>
  <li>Value Select</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="where-to-buy-corsair-memory-upgrades">Where to Buy Corsair Memory Upgrades</h2>

<p>Corsair memory is offered directly from the company (a bit pricey, if you ask me) and like pretty much all memory stores offers an easy to use shopping cart as well as a memory configurator to help you order the correct RAM for your notebook or PC. Corsair calls their configurator the Corsair Memory Finder. But if you want the best deal on Corsair memory I suggest you check Amazon for cheaper prices on Corsair ram than you could buy from the factory direct. There have even been times where there has been a rebate coupon for Corsair memory that increases the savings even more. Below are som of the best selling Corsair Memory Upgrades on sale today:</p>

    <h1><a href="/2012/11/what-is-triple-channel-memory/">What is Triple Channel Memory?</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>Triple Channel Memory is ram that offers (big surprise) more bandwidth than dual channel or even single channel memory. Single Channel memory runs at 64 bits, Dual Channel memory is 128 bits and lastly triple channel memory runs at 192bits.</p>

<p>DDR3 memory is the common name for triple channel memory upgrades and can be in the form of both DDR SDRAM dimms for destkop computer use or in sodimm memory modules for use with notebook computers. Common speeds of triple channel memory can be DDR3 1600MHz or DDR3 1333Mhz with the prior being the most popular triple channel memory type for computers in 2012 and beyond.</p>

<h2 id="triple-channel-memory-use">Triple Channel Memory Use</h2>

<p>It’s recommended to install triple channel memory in matched pairs. Most computers offer either two, four or in some cases eight memory upgrade slots with various memory upgrade banks  and it’s best to fill each bank with the same memory type and speed. It’s not  suggested to mix triple memory speeds as this can hinder PC performance and in some cases damage the motherboard.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-buy-triple-channel-memory">How to Buy Triple Channel Memory</h2>

<p>One way to get the correct ram for your desktop or PC is to use a memory upgrade configurator that will help you in getting the right RAM for your PC. All you do is enter your PC manufacturer, model name, and in some cases model Number. For example, manufacturer name would be Dell, model name would be Inspiron and model number would be N5010. When you have this information all you have to do is select the correct information and the memory upgrade store will help you get the right ram for your desktop or notebook PC.</p>

<p>Some computer  memory manufacturers also create a memory upgrade software that scans your  computer system to find the right memory type and then suggests compatible memory upgrades. <a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-1548159-10273954">Crucial Technology</a> is one memory manufacturer that offers this.</p>

<p>If  you’re a more experienced computer user who is comfortable building your own PC you can forgo the memory configurator and software altogether and buy triple channel memory from a selection of memory stores, or  if you prefer you can order triple channel memory from Amazon. I find that in most cases Amazon has the cheapest memory upgrades. Below are some of the best selling triple channel memory upgrades on sale today:</p>

    <h1><a href="/2012/11/how-to-get-a-free-pc-memory-test/">How To Get a Free PC Memory Test</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>PC Memory, in rare instances can go bad. RAM Memory is a very sensitive computer component that is susceptible to static electicity that can fry your memory very quickly, so it’s always a good idea to use an anti-static wristband and install ram in a humid environment to reduce the chance of static electricity. But even if you install the memory correctly you can still have problems with your PC memory but thankfully there are many methods to test your PC memory for any errors.</p>

<h2 id="remove-the-memory">Remove the Memory</h2>

<p>This seems kindof obvious I know, but one way to test ram to see if it’s bad is to remove and replace the memory upgrade with another memory chip. Usually, you have upgraded the ram in your PC with newer and larger memory upgrade modules, and if you still have the original factory installed memory upgrades all you have to do is replace the ram you suspect has gone bad with the older RAM. If your PC now runs without incident, then you know the RAM is bad and will have to be replaced. In the event of problems with your PC you should check your RAM for any problems</p>

<h2 id="free-pc-memory-testing-software">Free PC Memory Testing Software</h2>

<p>You don’t have to remove the ram you think has gone bad. There are many software programs that will allow you to test the memory in your PC without having to replace it to diagnose the memory problems:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.memtest86.com/"><strong>Memtest86</strong></a></p>

<p>This software is free software that allows you to test your PC ram for any errors. It’s easy to use and is a free download. This memory testing software does not require any software installed on the PC to run. Just download the ISO and using your  CD burning software. Easy to use, and diagnose any memory problems with this free memory testing software</p>

<p><a href="http://www.softpedia.com/get/Tweak/Memory-Tweak/Microsoft-Windows-Memory-Diagnostic.shtml"><strong>Windows Memory Diagnostic</strong></a></p>

<p>This memory testing software is like Memtest86 above, as it does not require an operating system to run and will run on any PC. Just download the ISO and follow the instructions to burn a bootable CD to test your PC memory with the Windows Memory Diagnostic Tool</p>

<p><a href="http://www.memtest.org/"><strong>MemTest86+</strong></a></p>

<p>Note the plus sign at the end. This is newer memory testing software that tests for memory module failure. Download the ISO, burn to a CD and you can test the memory on your PC with ease with MemTest86+</p>

<p>These are just three of the memory testing software for your PC. One other way to be certain your PC memory is error free is to buy brand name memory or ram from a trusted memory manufacturer like Crucial, Corsair, or Kingston Memory. All these manufacturers offer a lifetime replacement guarantee in the event that your memory upgrade goes bad. Below are some of the more popular memory upgrades available on sale today:</p>

    <h1><a href="/2012/11/where-to-buy-micron-technology-ram-and-flash-memory-upgrades/">Where To Buy Micron Technology RAM and Flash Memory Upgrades</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>Micron Technology has been manufacturing ram and more recently flash memory products since the early 1980’s and at one point actually sold micron branded memory upgrades. But in 2012, Micron Technology sells most of the memory and flash memory they manufacture under two brand names:</p>

<h2 id="crucial-technology1"><strong><a href="http://www.crucial.com">Crucial Technology</a></strong></h2>

<hr />
<p>Crucial Technology is one of the best memory upgrade brands you can buy and have been selling memory upgrades online for over 15 years now (at least as long as I have been tracking and monitoring ram prices.</p>

<p>One of the main features of Crucial Technology is the number of tools they offer to help you get the right memory upgrade for your computer regardless of make or computer brand. Using either the memory configurator where you select the Make and Model of your computer, or the application you can download that scans your computer for the right memory upgrade for you Mac or PC.</p>

<p>Popular memory upgrades are just a mouse click away for Apple, Dell, HP and Sony computer memory upgrades</p>

<p>In recent times as demand for memory upgrades have declined, Crucial Technology have expanded their product line to include both traditional and solid state hard drives as the prices for solid state hard drives continue to drop it’s now possible and affordable to replace the standard hard drive in your notebook or desktop computer with a much faster solid state hard drive. In some cases, a SSD drive upgrade can cost less than $100.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2012/11/what-is-dual-channel-memory/">What is Dual Channel Memory?</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>Dual Channel Memory is commonly known as DDR or DDR2 memory and usually ships in two distinct sizes: SDRAM DDR2 DIMMS for desktop computers and DDR2 SDRAM sodimms for notebook computers. Speeds for DDR2 memory range from PC-3200 to PC-6400. In 2012, DDR2 dual channel memory is not the fastest DDR memory you can buy with DDR3 technology up tp 1600Mhz and beyond being the most popular DDR memory upgrades today. DDR2 memory upgrades were more popular from the period of about 2005 to 2008 when they were replaced with the much faster DDR3 memory standard.</p>

<h2 id="how-dual-channel-memory-works"><strong>How Dual Channel Memory Works</strong></h2>

<p>Dual Channel Memory is usually installed in pairs, and refers to the fact that the DDR or DDR2 memory is used on the moterboard. With two memory slots on a DDR2 motherboard available for memory upgrades, when DDR2 or even DDR memory is installed the computer can process memory data twice as fast as the DDR standard. The dual channel allow for one memory bank to read and write data while the next memory bank is getting ready for the next stream of data. This eliminates wait time as one memory bank is always ready for the next stream of data, effectively doubling the read and write timings. To gain the advantage that DDR2 memory upgrades offer, it is recommended that you install DDR2 memory upgrades in matched pairs for the most reliable computing experience.</p>

<h2 id="most-popular-ddr2-memory-brands">Most Popular DDR2 Memory Brands</h2>

<p>DDR2 dual channel memory is available in both generic memory where the memory vendor manufactures or resells the memory and the warranty for DDR2 generic memory depends on the vendor or  you can buy name brand DDR2 memory upgrades from a wide array of computer memory manufacturers: Crucial Technology, Kingston Technology and Corsair Memory are just a few DDR2 memory upgrade manufacturers that offer brand name memory and warranty support for dual channel memory upgrades.</p>

<h2 id="where-to-buy-dual-channel-memory">Where To  Buy Dual Channel Memory</h2>

<p>You can buy dual channel memory from a wide array of memory vendors (see my list of memory stores bel0w) but some of the best prices and  cheapest dual channel memory upgrades tend to be found online at Amazon. Below are a few examples:</p>

    <h1><a href="/2012/11/how-to-upgrade-flash-memory/">How To Upgrade Flash Memory</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>Flash Memory is becoming the defacto memory standard of 2012 and int0 2013 with products from digital cameras to notebook computers and even smartphones using flash memory upgrades for more storage for your data. Flash memory comes in many different form factors depending on the device you want to use flash memory for but  below are some of the more common flash memory upgrades on sale today:</p>

<h2 id="solid-state-drives">Solid State Drives</h2>

<p>Solid state hard drives have become the standard hard drive installed in many new notebook  computers (and to a lesser extent, desktop computers too) thanks to advancements in manufacturing and more demand for the much faster flash storage that SSD drives offer. At time of writing, one can buy a 128GB SSD drive for less than $100 and 256GB SSD drives  can be had for under $200.00. What was once a luxury on the leading edge is becoming more mainstream each and every day. SSD drives offer no moving parts, much faster read and write times and startup times than even the fastest standard drive. The disadvantage to the SSD drive is that larger capacity SSD’s at 512GB and up are still much more expensive than traditional hard drives in the same capacity</p>

<h2 id="compact-flash-memory">Compact Flash Memory</h2>

<p>Compact Flash Memory is usually used in more advanced digital cameras such as pro-sumer or  professional DSLR’s and offer faster read and write times than SDHC memory cards can offer that are smaller in size and more popular in compact digital cameras and other devices. Compact Flash memory upgrades are available in a wide array of sizes in speeds but common and best selling compact flash memory upgrades are 32GB  and up to 400x in speed.</p>

<h2 id="sdhc-memory">SDHC Memory</h2>

<p>SDHC memory is available in many sizes. The standard micro SDHC memory cards are a favorite for digital camera and computer users thanks to their smaller size when compared to compact flash memory upgrades.  Micro SD memory cards are also a very popular choice for cellular and smartphones and it’s hard to imagine that storage space of up to 64GB can fit on a memory card smaller than your fingernail.</p>

<h2 id="usb-flash-memory">USB Flash Memory</h2>

<p>These might be the most popular types of flash memory and grace many a keychain or computer users desktop. With many shapes and sizes these USB drives or thumb drives come in a variety of  shapes and sizes from standard design to novelty designs shaped like teddy bears. USB flash memory is a popular marketing tool thanks to the fact that you can buy USB flash drives with your  company message screen printed on the flash drive itself. With a cost of under $1.00 each in  some cases, customized usb flash memory drives are a great way to promote your  company and your message or logo.</p>

<h2 id="where-to-buy-flash-memory-upgrades">Where To Buy Flash Memory Upgrades</h2>

<p>All of these types of flash memory upgrades are available at numerous stores online but I find one of the best places to buy flash memory of any kind is at Amazon. They constantly have the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957"><strong>lowest prices on flash memory</strong></a> regardless of type or size.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2012/11/cheap-computer-memory-upgrades-where-to-buy/">Cheap Computer Memory Upgrades: Where To Buy</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>If you’re looking to buy cheap computer memory, you’ve come to the right place because all I do every day is help you get the cheapest computer memory prices possible and I have been monitoring and tracking cheap computer memory prices for over 15 year now. If you’re in the market for cheap memory I list prices that are the lowest I could find.</p>

<h2 id="cheap-apple-computer-memory"><strong>Cheap Apple Computer Memory</strong></h2>

<p>I started ramseeker tracking ram prices for just Apple computers so if there’s one thing I know, it’s where to get computer memory for Apple computers cheaply. In 2012, almost all current Apple computers take the same amount of RAM. Mac Mini, MacBook Pro and Apple iMac all use  DDR3 1600Mhz  SDRAM sodimms. Here are the lowest prices on Apple Memory I could find:</p>

<p>[table id=15 /]</p>

<h2 id="cheap-hp-computer-memory"><strong>Cheap HP Computer Memory</strong></h2>

<p>Memory for HP notebooks are another type of memory you can get cheaply now and like the Apple products, most HP notebooks like the HP Envy will allow up to 16GB of RAM installed and not only is HP memory cheap, but  it will allow you to work much faster regardless of whether you use your HP notebook for fun or business.</p>

<p>[table id=15 /]</p>

<h2 id="cheap-dell-computer-memory">Cheap Dell Computer Memory</h2>

<p>Dell Inspirons, XPS or Latitude models all take more ram and like the HP and Apple’s above you can get ram much much cheaper when you buy the memory anywhere but from Dell which tends to overcharge for their memory upgrades. You’re much better off buying ram from one of the memory stores below. When you do, not only will you save money on RAM, your dell will run faster and allow you to open more applications at the same time. Most Dell notebooks this year can accept up to 16GB of RAM. Check your manual .</p>

<p>[table id=15 /]</p>

<p> </p>

<h2 id="cheap-sony-computer-memory">Cheap Sony Computer Memory</h2>

<p>Sony computers are usually not known for being the cheapest computer you can buy, unless you get a deal on a Sony notebook  most  Sony VAIO models tend to be expensive than their DEll or HP counterparts.  But just because the Sony notebook is pricey doesn’t mean you can’t  get ram for Sony notebook computers cheaply. Most Sony’s can accept  up  to 16GB of RAM and installing ram in a Sony notebook is easy and cheap when you buy ram for Sony Notebooks from these stores:</p>

<p>[table id=15 /]</p>

<h2 id="where-to-buy-cheap-computer-memory-upgrades">Where To Buy Cheap Computer Memory Upgrades</h2>

<p>In addition to the memory stores in the pricing tables above,  I like buying cheap memory from Amazon as a lot of times they tend to have better prices on RAM than any other memory store and offer not only the cheapest computer memory prices but outstanding return policies too. Here are some suggestions for cheap computer memory:</p>

    <h1><a href="/2012/11/where-to-buy-imac-ram/">Where To Buy iMac RAM</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>The iMacs in 2012 are becoming one of the most popular Apple desktops to be released this year for a few reasons: First, the design is even slimmer for the new Apple iMacs vs the 2011 Apple iMacs, and secondly you can upgrade some of the higher end iMac models all the way to 32GB, which is double the ram capacity for older iMacs from laster year. The ram upgrade chart for the current iMacs look like this:<img class="size-full wp-image-6672 alignnone" title="where to buy iMac RAM" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Screen-Shot-2012-11-05-at-3.10.27-PM.png" alt="" width="837" height="744" /></p>

<h3 id="ghz-apple-imac-215-inch-screen">2.7GHz Apple iMac 21.5 inch Screen</h3>

<p>This iMac ships from the factory with just 8GB of ram installed (4GBX2), but you can max out the ram on this iMac model and I suggest you do because iMac ram is so cheap this year.</p>

<h3 id="ghz-apple-imac-215-inch-screen-1">2.9GHz Apple iMac 21.5 inch Screen</h3>

<p>This iMac is the same specifications when it comes to memory – you still start with 8GB of iMac ram from Apple, but you can max out the ram on this iMac to 16GB</p>

<h3 id="ghz-apple-imac-27-inch-screen">2.9GHz Apple iMac 27 inch Screen</h3>

<p>If you cough up big money for the 27 inches of screen real estate, you not only get a bigger display, you also get more memory capacity – but if you add 8GB of ram x 4 you can max out the memory on the new Apple iMacs all the way to 32GB of RAM – one of the first Apple iMacs able to accept 32GB of RAM</p>

<h3 id="ghz-apple-imac-27-inch-screen-1">3.2GHz Apple iMac 27 inch Screen</h3>

<p>The fastest Apple iMac also requires the same ram as the other 27 inch Apple computer and will also accept 32GB of ram in the four memory upgrade slots the Apple iMac has.</p>

<h2 id="where-to-buy-imac-ram">Where To Buy iMac RAM</h2>

<p>All of the Apple iMac models above require the newest in Apple memory technology  – and that’s DDR3 1600Mhz sodimms.  The sodimms are considered notebook ram but the iMac, despite the desktop form factor does require the smaller sodimm for notebook compters vs the SDRAM DIMM designed for desktops computers.</p>

<p>The prices for iMac RAM continue to drop over the years and in fact the memory for iMacs have been the best deal I have ever seen on Apple iMac memory. Below are the best prices on iMac RAM and the memory stores where you can buy iMac RAM.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2012/11/what-ram-do-i-need-for-apple-imac/">What RAM Do I Need for Apple iMac?</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>One of the best ways to find out exactly what ram you need for your iMac is to use a memory configurator to get the best ram prices for iMac that you know will work. You also don’t have to guess with charts and tables either. All you have to do is choose your brand (Apple, obviously) what Apple iMac you have (2010, 2012, processor speed, screen size ) and the memory configurator will then tell you exactly what RAM you need to buy for your Apple iMac.</p>

<p><strong>2012 Apple iMac RAM Types </strong></p>

<p>The 2012 iMacs were just released in late October 2012 and now join the MacBook Pro models and the Mac Mini as using the much faster DDR3 1600Mhz sodimms. This is the fastest iMac RAM you can buy today.</p>

<p><strong>Where to Buy RAM for 2012 Apple iMac </strong></p>

<p>You can buy ram for iMac from pretty much any store that will sell and stock ddr3 1600mhz sodimms, but I suggest you buy RAM from the following memory stores for memory for the new Apple iMacs. One thing to note is that the 27 inch Apple iMacs can now accept 32GB of ram so you will need to buy 8GB memory modules x4. For the smaller screen iMacs, you are limited to a maximum of  16Gb and you can buy a 16GB memory upgrade kit or two 8GB iMac RAM kits or 4x4GB ddr3 1600 Mhz sodimms to get you to the maximum of 16GB allowed.</p>

<p>[table id=15 /]</p>

<p><strong>2011 Apple IMac RAM Types </strong></p>

<p>The now discontinued Apple iMacs (<a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-1548159-10847025"><strong><em>check here for some great deals</em></strong></a>) take the slower 1333mhz spec’d ddr3 sodimms so be sure to buy the right memory for the 2011 iMacs vs the 2012 iMacs that use faster memory. Like the smaller 2012 iMac models, all 2011 Apple iMacs can only accept up  to 16GB of RAM maximum. If  you want to install more than 16GB of RAM in a 2011 or older iMac – you can’t and will need to buy a 27 inch Apple iMac.</p>

<p>[table id=7 /]</p>

<p>For older iMac models,I recommend you check either <a href="http://www.lowendmac.com">lowendmac</a> or <a href="http://www.everymac.com">everymac</a> for ram specifications for the older Mac models as I tend to concentrating on getting you the best deals on iMac memory for new iMacs vs older iMacs.</p>

<p>Buy a Brand New 2012 iMac.</p>

<p>If you’re ready to buy a 2012 iMac I suggest you check <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;field-keywords=iMac&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;url=search-alias%3Daps"><strong>Amazon</strong></a> or <a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-1548159-10847025"><strong>MacMall</strong></a> for the best deals on a 2012 Apple iMac.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2012/11/what-is-the-best-value-usb-dac-for-2012/">What is the Best Value USB DAC for 2012?</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p><img class="alignnone" title="best usb dac for 2012" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/JIM_5414.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" /></p>

<p>One way to get better sound out of your computer or iPod  is to use an external DAC. A DAC, (digital audio converter) does what the description says it does: It translates digital audio to analog sound that is then amplified to your headphones (or loudspeakers) . In all but a few cases, the DAC inside your computer is not the best way to convert the digital signal from your audio files, regardless of whether they are in FLAC format, MP3 or Apple Lossless format the DAC inside your notebook or desktop computer is not going to be the best quality.</p>

<p>If you can now easily buy a brand new laptop for under $400, it only makes sense that the DAC isn’t going to be the best of quality. Then you also have to consider the noise inside the notebook computer from spinning hard drives (this is not really an issue with solid state drives thanks to the lack of moving parts on solid state drives), and all these factors add up to the fact that you’re not going get the best sound out of the headphone jack on your iPOd or notebook computer.</p>

<p>The solution to this is buy an external DAC for your notebook. You can spend silly money on a DAC  if you want, but one of the best DACs I have found (and am listening to right now as I write this) is the Fiio E7 portable headphone DAC. (<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/fiio-e7-portable-dac-and-headphone-amplifier-review/" title="Fiio E7 Portable DAC and Headphone Amplifier Review">see my review here</a>). This small DAC is about the size of a small deck of cards and yet features a much better quality chip inside of the small and battery powered DAC.</p>

<p>Using the Fiio E7 with an iPod is easy (buy the iPod adapter cable) and then connect the Fiio E7 to the connector on the bottom of your iPod and then plug your headphones into the DAC</p>

<p>If you want to connect the DAC to your computer, all you need is a USB cable that comes with the Fiio E7 and connect the DAC to the USB output (you’re going to have to configure your computer to output through the USB port) and then connect your headphones.</p>

<p>For the money,  (well under $100) this has to be one of the  best values in a small and portable DAC that is very flexible and can be used as a portable self powered DAC for your iPod,  a notebook computer DAC or if you buy an external amplifier, can also be used as a DAC for your desktop computer to. You really can’t find a more versatile DAC for listening to your digital files and getting much better sound quality in 2012.</p>

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>While we hang around and wait for the 2012 Apple iMacs to show up, I thought I’d take a look at the current offerrings from Apple in the iMac department. I mean, afterall – I do track iMac memory prices – it only makes sense to learn all I can about the 2012 iMac.</p>

<h2 id="the-2012-imac-lineup">The 2012 iMac Lineup</h2>

<p> </p>

<p>Is really, the summer 2011 Apple iMacs as that’s the latest Apple iMac to come out of Apple. Except for MacBook Pro’s we haven’t seen one new computer from Apple this year. But seeing as how these are the best iMacs we’re going to see for a while it looks like, we may as well get to know <a href="http://www.apple.com/imac/">Apple’s best selling Apple Desktop computer. </a></p>

<h2 id="i5-apple-imacs">i5 Apple iMacs</h2>

<p><strong>Apple iMac 21.5 inch 2.5Gz</strong></p>

<p>This iMac is the cheapest Apple iMac you can buy today. Starting at just $1199.00, you get a 2.5Ghz Intel i5 processor, a 500gb hard drive and 4GB of RAM. (add more ram – see the prices to your right)</p>

<p><strong>Apple iMac 21.5 inch 2.7Ghz</strong></p>

<p>If you’ve got a bit more money to spend, it might be worth it to check out the 2.7Ghz i5 iMac. You get more speed, and a bigger 1TB hard drive for $300 more. (I still think the cheaper iMac is the better deal)</p>

<p><strong>Apple iMac 27 inch 2.7Ghz</strong></p>

<p>If I were going to spend any money on an iMac, this is where I would start. The bigger real estate is a welcome addition to my workflow, and the price difference isn’t that bad-you have to find another $500 from the starter iMac but you get a faster processor and 1TB hard drive. You’re paying t a premium for the iMac screen but I think it’s worth the cost</p>

<p><strong>Apple iMac 27 inch 3.1Ghz </strong></p>

<p>Unless you have money  to burn  I would stay away from this model. To me, the biggest iMac isn’t the best deal on an iMac when you compare the 3.1Ghz model to other iMac models in 2012.</p>

<h2 id="i7-apple-imacs">i7 Apple iMacs</h2>

<p>I wish. It turns out, there are no Apple iMacs available yet with faster i7 processors. There’s a complete selection of Apple i5 iMacs from which to choose but nope, no i7 Apple iMacs yet. Again, something to look forward to when Apple finally releases the 2012 Apple iMacs.</p>

<p>I would buy the 8GB MacBook Air vs the 4GB MacBook Air – finances allowing, of course.</p>

<p>And here’s why: Initially, the 8GB MacBook Air will cost you more money, but over time if you keep your MacBook Air or even sell it down the road you get more value out of a MacBook Air with more ram than you would by buying a MacBook Air with less memory, even though short-term you can save money with a cheaper MacBook Air.</p>

<h2 id="a-8gb-macbook-air-is-a-better-deal">A 8GB Macbook Air is a Better Deal</h2>

<p>Let’s assume you only keep your MacBook Air for two years.</p>

<p>A 4GB MacBook Air costs $1199 for the 13inch MBA, yet the 8GB MacBook Air costs only $100 more bringing the total to $1299.00. That $100 difference is a small price to pay, especially when amortized over 2 years.</p>

<p>4GB MacBook Air – 1200/24 = 50.00 a month</p>

<p>8GB MacBook Air – 1300/24 = $54.17 a month.</p>

<p>For the price of one starbucks latte a month you can get into a MacBook Air with more RAM. Applications are only going to require more ram as browsers get more complicated, facebook starts to display larger photos, or if you’re into photo editing with Apple Aperture like I am you’ll definitely wish you bought the 8GB of RAM.</p>

<p>I would even skimp on hard drive space if I had a choice between buying more ram for my MacBook Air vs adding a bigger SSD storage. You can always add storage later externally. I find I need very little storage when it comes to using my portable computers as all my files are on external drives tethered to my Mac Mini.</p>

<h2 id="sell-the-8gb-macbook-air-for-more-money">Sell The 8GB MacBook Air for More Money</h2>

<p>Resale value is another thing to consider when thinking about buying a brand new MacBook Air. Using my 2 year estimate (at least that’s the amount my wife lets me upgrade – you may be single, or have a larger budget for Apple computers than I do) you’re looking at getting more value from your MacBook Air with more ram than you would with a MacBook Air with just 4GB.</p>

<p>Unlike the Apple MacBook Pro models, where you can add ram later on, the MacBook Air models do not offer a chance to later upgrade the memory so you’d better get your MacBook Air purchase right the first time and buy the MacBook Air with more ram. 8GB of ram in 2012 for the MacBook Air is not a lot of RAM with 16GB starting to be the standard for MacBook notebooks as we enter into 2013.</p>

<p>For the cost of a cup of coffee, I would buy the 8GB MacBook Air over the 4GB MacBook Air as I would find the extra four dollars a month it would cost me to buy the MacBook Air with more RAM.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2012/08/who-has-the-best-pc-memory-finder/">Who Has The Best PC Memory Finder?</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>If you’re looking to buy RAM for any of the best selling computer brands, one of the easiest ways to get the right ram for your PC is to use what is called a PC Memory Finder. This could also be known as a PC memory configurator, or PC memory helper, or PC Memory Menu even, but essentially a tool to help you decipher memory upgrades, because for folks like you and me, getting the right ram for your Mac or PC can be sometimes tricky.</p>

<h2 id="how-a-pc-memory-finder-works">How a PC Memory Finder Works</h2>

<p>You need to know just three things in order to use a PC Memory Finder and they are:</p>

<p>You computer brand. What brand of computer do you have? Dell? Apple? HP? Sony? Usually you select your computer brand and then continue to the next step.</p>

<p>Your Computer Model or Group. If you have an Apple MacBook Pro you would select MacBook Pro, for instance.</p>

<p>Your Computer Model Number or Name. Because computers come in sooo many sizes and shapes you need to know your computers model number. For Apple, that may be Apple MacBook Pro Retina Display Spring 2012, or a Dell Inspiron N5040, whatever you need to specify exactly what computer you need.</p>

<p>That’s it. Once you have these 3 pieces of information, you’re presented with a list of compatible memory upgrades and usually the vendor’s web page will supply other pertinent information in regards to your specific computer model – like how many memory slots your computer has, or how much the maximum ram your PC can use and recognize.</p>

<p>You then pick the right ram for your PC. I suggest buying the maximum memory for your PC to enhance performance to the maximum.</p>

<h2 id="the-best-pc-memory-finder"><strong>The Best PC Memory Finder</strong></h2>

<p>I like the <a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-1548159-10273954"><strong>PC Memory Finder at Crucial</strong></a> the best out off all the computer memory finders available online – not only do you get name brand memory upgrades with a gaurantee that the ram is the right ram for you computer, you also get recommendations for hard drives compatible with your computer too allowing you to upgrade the hard drive for your PC at the same time. A hard drive and ram upgrade is one way to extend the life of your current computer without having to buy a brand new computer which can be more expensive than upgrading the computer you already have.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2012/08/where-to-buy-memory-cards-for-digital-cameras/">Where To Buy Memory Cards for Digital Cameras</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p><strong>Memory cards for digital cameras</strong>. If you don’t have one(or more) you are dead in the water and your <a href="http://www.camerahelpers.com" title="best digital camera">fancy digital camera might</a> as well be a door stop, or conversation piece for your coffee table. A digital camera memory card is to a digital camera or DSLR, what a roll of film or kodachrome (RIP) was to film cameras back in the day.</p>

<h2 id="what-kind-of-memory-cards-for-digital-cameras-do-i-need"><strong>What Kind of Memory Cards for Digital Cameras Do I Need? </strong></h2>

<p>For most of us memory cards for cameras in 2012 come in two different forms: compact flash and SDHC memory cards. The former tend to be used with higher end DSLR’s (My Nikon D300 takes compact flash) while the latter is mostly used in compact or more consumer based DSLR’s. One of the benefits of the SDHC cards over the compact flash is that they tend to be more compatible with other devices too and there’s a good chance your notebook Mac or PC will include a SDHC memory card reader built into the notebook, avoiding the need to use or carry an external memory card reader.</p>

<p>There are a few memory card types from Sony that tend to be less mainstream – their memorystick technology never really took the world by storm and it’s too soon to see if the Sony XQD technology will become mainstream. Right now, this is a very expensive memory card.</p>

<h2 id="what-about-memory-card-speed">What About Memory Card Speed?</h2>

<p>Like a lot of things in the technology world – the faster the better, and this applies to memory cards too as the faster the card the faster your camera can write the file to the card and is ready to take the next shot. The last thing you want to do is be left waiting while your memory card writes your file(s) to your memory card. Common speeds are 45Mb/s for SDHC memory cards and 30 to 90 MB/s for compact flash memory cards.</p>

<h2 id="what-size-of-memory-card-should-i-buy-for-my-digital-camera">What Size of Memory Card Should I Buy For My Digital Camera?</h2>

<p>I like to buy the biggest memory card I can buy for the best price I can find online. This may require some time and patience but you can get some really good deals on camera memory if you shop around. I tend to shoot JPEG vs RAW so my space requirements are much less than a RAW shooter with a high megapixel digital camera. I have an 8GB card in my Nikon D300 that’s been just fine for years, and I have never run out of room.</p>

<h2 id="where-to-buy-memory-cards-for-digital-cameras"><strong>Where To Buy Memory Cards for Digital Cameras </strong></h2>

<p>I like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/mn/search/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;bbn=516866&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;keywords=memory%20card&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;qid=1345744164&amp;rh=n%3A172282%2Cn%3A!493964%2Cn%3A541966%2Cn%3A172456%2Cn%3A516866%2Ck%3Amemory%20card&amp;tag=ramseeker-20"><strong>Amazon for lots of memory cards</strong></a> due to the fact that I have an Amazon Prime membership, so shipping is fast and free, but you should also check <a href="http://www.adorama.com/?&amp;KBID=64104"><strong>Adorama</strong></a> and<a href="http://www.bhphotovideo.com/?BI=8956&amp;KBID=10401&amp;DFF=d10-v1-t8-x4">** B+H**</a> for Digital Camera memory cards too as they often feature deals on memory cards as well from time to time too.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2012/08/when-will-the-2012-mac-mini-release-date-be/">When Will The 2012 Mac Mini Release Date Be?</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>I am writing this on a** 2011 Apple Mac Mini<strong>. It’s the higher end model, and my wife works with the l</strong>ower end model too<strong>. We’re a Mac Mini family. But both of these apple Mac Minis were released in 2011, not this year – and that means they are a year old now, <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/is-applecare-for-a-2011-macbook-pro-worth-it/" title="Is AppleCare Worth It for A MacBook Pro?">out of warranty</a> and slowly becoming obsolete. We would love to buy new Apple Mac Mini’s but there’s one problem. Apple has not released them yet. The only brand new Apple computer we have seen is the **MacBook Pro Retina</strong> display, and even that model is a few months old now</p>

<h2 id="when-i-think-the-mac-mini-release-date-will-be"><strong>When I think the Mac Mini Release Date Will Be</strong></h2>

<p>The Apple Mac Mini is one of the more popular computers due to the fact that they are the cheapest Apple Mac you can buy. They are not the Apple computer under $500, but they are close. If you shop around you can buy a Mac Mini for a small discount  – about $35.00 on <strong>Amazon</strong>, <strong>MacMall</strong> or** Best Buy** for even less than the Apple Store charges. And speaking of the Apple Store, one way to get a cheap Mac Mini is to check the <a href="http://store.apple.com/us/browse/home/specialdeals/mac/mac_mini"><strong>refurbished Apple Mac Mini section</strong></a> on the Apple Store online. It’s hit and miss with stock, but if you’re willing to wait this is the only way to buy a Mac under $500.00.</p>

<p>Another reason for the popularity of the Mac MIni is the fact that these make excellent home theater or audio servers. You don’t need fancy software of any kind. All you need is the free iTunes and some sort of wireless connector for your TV or stereo – usually in the form of an <strong>airport express</strong> or <strong>Apple TV</strong>. You don’t need a monitor once you’ve got the Mac Mini set up for serving your movie and music files and you can control the Mac Mini via your Apple iPhone thanks to the free Apple remote software.</p>

<p>All this said, there’s more than one computer from Apple we’re waiting for we haven’t seen a release date for the iMac either yet, or the Mac Pro yet too. All the rumors for the Mac Pro seem to state 2013 for it, but we could see a brand new <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/when-will-the-imac-2012-release-date-be/" title="When Will The iMac 2012 Release Date Be?">Apple iMac release as early as September 2012.</a> We’re already into the end of August, so that doesn ‘t leave much time and Apple usually refreshes the iPod line in the fall too to grab a good share of the holiday shopping season. We might even see an iPad 4 by the end of the year too.</p>

<p>So when to squeeze a Mac Mini release into all that? The Mac Mini would be a better choice than a new iMac release due to the cost and use as a media servier so I think that this will come first. When, I have no idea but my guess would be either late fall or early in January 2013 we should see a faster processor (probably the same as the MacBook Pro’s) and probably a ram increase too to <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/mac-mini-ddr3-memory-upgrade-prices/">8GB of RAM</a> with a maximum of 16GB for the Mac Mini instead of the current 8GB maximum Apple recommends.</p>

<p>Of course, I could be wrong with all of this and Apple could wait until later in 2013 and continue to sell the best selling computer in their lineup, the MacBook Pro and MacBook Air, as these are 2012 Apple computers already. Like a lot of things in life, only time will tell <strong>when the final release date for the Apple Mac Mini</strong> will be.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2012/08/what-is-the-least-expensive-nikon-full-frame-camera/">What is the Least Expensive Nikon Full Frame Camera?</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>If you’re shooting any type of full frame lenses, your best bet is to shoot with a full frame camera vs a DX camera – especially if you’re shooting wide angle lenses and want to take advantage of their perspective and large viewing angle. On full frame cameras, the wide angles can really sing in getting you great photos whether you are shooting landscapes or group photos or perhaps you just want to get a different view on the world – shooting wide angle lenses allows you to do it.</p>

<p>If you’re shooting longer lenses, or even normal lenses on DX cameras like the Nikon D7000 for example, understand that any Nikon lens you mount on a Nikon DX camer will multiply the focal length by 1.5x. Your 35mm 1.8 becomes a 52mm 1.8 – In a way this is great because you now have a<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/nikon-afs-nikkor-35mm-f1-8-dx-g-review-and-best-prices/" title="Nikon AFS Nikkor 35mm f/1.8 DX G Review and Best Prices."> very fast normal lens for under $200</a>, and if you shoot longer telephotos – they really help you extend your reach – great for shooting sports or birds when you can’t get close to the action.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0076AYNXM/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0076AYNXM&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=ramseeker-20"><img class="size-full wp-image-6174 alignleft" title="Best full frame nikon camera" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Screen-Shot-2012-08-23-at-9.31.50-AM.png" alt="cheapest full frame Nikon camera" width="291" height="298" /></a></p>

<p><strong>The Advantages of Full Frame Cameras</strong></p>

<p>The advantage of full frame cameras usually come in the terms of image quality. Because a full frame or FX camera’s sensor is bigger the images tend to be more natural because you’re not cramming as much pixels into such a small space. For me, the advantages of full frame are the wide angle lens use, but there’s ways around it by buying DX wide angle lenses but even at 18mm wide you may not find that wide enough. I would much prefer to shoot with my Nikon 20mm f/2.8 at 20mm than an 18-55 DX lens where the math works out to a 28mm focal length.</p>

<p><strong>The Cheapest Nikon Full Frame Camera</strong></p>

<p>For Nikon shooters, we currently have two options if you want to shoot in full frame, and that comes in the form of the Nikon D800 or Nikon D700.</p>

<p>The Nikon D700 is the cheaper of the two with a street price of about $2200. This is a four year old camera though and offers the technology that was the best at the time with 12 megapixels of resolution, outstanding low light performance and 51 point autofocus system. Check <a href="http:/http://www.adorama.com/INKD700.html&amp;KBID=64104"><strong>Adorama</strong></a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BTCSI6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001BTCSI6&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=ramseeker-20"><strong>Amazon</strong></a> and <a href="http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/570162-REG/Nikon_25444_D700_SLR_Digital_Camera.html/BI/8956/KBID/10401"><strong>B+H</strong></a> for the best prices on the Nikon D700</p>

<p>The Nikon D800 is the much newer full frame camera from Nikon and offers much higher resolution – almost 3x as much at 36MP, faster processors, and much newer technology than the much older Nikon D700. You’ll pay a premium for this though with a street price for the Nikon D800 of about $3000.00 online. Check <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0076AYNXM/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0076AYNXM&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=ramseeker-20"><strong>Amazon</strong></a>, <a href="http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/842926-REG/Nikon_D800_D_800_SLR_Digital_Camera.html/BI/8956/KBID/10401"><strong>B+H</strong> </a>and <a href="http://www.adorama.com/INKD800.html&amp;KBID=64104"><strong>Adorama</strong></a> for prices.</p>

<p>At the current time, the cheapest Nikon full frame camera is the Nikon D700. Is it worth it to skip the Nikon D700 and go to the Nikon D800? One question you have to ask yourself is do you shoot video, or are you planning to? The Nikon D700 does not offer HD video shooting while the Nikon D800 does. In my mind, this is the major difference between the Nikon D700 and Nikon D800 and depending on your answer the price you pay for the Nikon D800 – even though you may end up paying more for it than the Nikon D700 might be worth it.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2012/08/what-is-the-best-sony-5-1-receiver-price/">What is the Best Sony 5.1 Receiver Price?</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content">Sony receivers for both home theater use and even stereo listening can be great bargains, if you shop around and analyze your needs on what you plan on using the 5.1 receiver for. All come with a plethora of features that include several audio and video inputs, HDMI in and out, and a stereo tuner for AM and FM listening. Of course, being a 5.1 receiver from Sony, that means there are also front speakers, a center speaker and surround speaker connectors to. You'll need to buy your speakers for your sony receiver separately, and there's too many options to list here today. But, let's look at a few Sony 5.1 Receivers and their prices. One of these should be the best Sony receiver for you.
<h1></h1>
<h1>Sony STRDH520 7.1 Channel 3D AV Receiver</h1>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006U1VGQU/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B006U1VGQU&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=ramseeker-20"><img class="size-full wp-image-6169 alignleft" title="best sony receiver" alt="cheapest sony receiver" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Screen-Shot-2012-08-23-at-8.05.56-AM.png" width="461" height="356" /></a>

This Sony is a 7.1 vs 5.1 receiver, but don't worry about that as all this means is there are an extra set of surround speaker connectors on the back of the receiver, and you don't need to use them if you don't need or want to. This is one of the best selling home theater receivers under $300 and definitely worth consideration thanks to it's impressive feature set:
<ul>
	<li>100 watts per channel for all seven channels.</li>
	<li>6 HD connections. Four are HDMI and 2 component video</li>
	<li>3D Pass Thru</li>
	<li>HD Digital Cinema Sound</li>
	<li>Dolby TrueHD, Pro logic IIz and dts HD enhanced audio codecs</li>
</ul>
This is a full featured receiver for both audio and HT from Sony, and the best part is all this<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004NHCGJO/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004NHCGJO&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=ramseeker-20"><strong> only costs a little over $200. </strong></a>

But what if you need more features and want to spend a little more money for a Sony receiver to get those features? The Sony mentioned above might be the best budget receiver from Sony, but it may not be the best overall deal. Sometimes, it's best to spend a bit more money on a Sony receiver.
<h1>Sony STRDH830 Sony 3D 7.1 Channel A/V Receiver</h1>
This Sony <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006U1VGQU/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B006U1VGQU&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=ramseeker-20"><strong>will cost you a bit more money</strong></a>, double in fact compared to the cheaper STRDH5220 above, but you get one important feature that I think every receiver for 2012 should have, and that's iPod connectivity. The Apple iPod has become the defacto standard when it comes to portable music, but when you're at home or office you want to listen to something with a little more oooph, and the Sony receiver above offers that in spades and will sound much better than the Apple earbuds that came with your Apple iPod.

The best part? This Sony receiver even includes an Apple iPod dock, unlike some other brands that force you to buy an iPod dock for your stereo or home theater receiver separately. This is the perfect marriage between the two biggest electronics companies in the world today.

Besides the fact that you can use the iPod with this receiver, the Sony STRDH830 also offers more power (140 watts, instead of 100 watts), another HDMI input (5 vs 4), the ability to upscale analog video to 1080i, an advanced on-screen digital display, Digital audio calibration for perfect sound from all your speakers, and Bravia sync so you only need one remote control when used in conjunction with your Sony Bravia HDTV.

Overall, I think that this is the much better value receiver from the two. Yes, you pay more up front, but the higher end Sony includes an iPod dock, and connectivity options, and I know for me, that's worth much much more than the minimal increase in cost.

This Sony is a 7.1 vs 5.1 receiver, but don't worry about that as all this means is there are an extra set of surround speaker connectors on the back of the receiver, and you don't need to use them if you don't need or want to. This is one of the best selling home theater receivers under $300 and definitely worth consideration thanks to it's impressive feature set:
<ul>
	<li>100 watts per channel for all seven channels.</li>
	<li>6 HD connections. Four are HDMI and 2 component video</li>
	<li>3D Pass Thru</li>
	<li>HD Digital Cinema Sound</li>
	<li>Dolby TrueHD, Pro logic IIz and dts HD enhanced audio codecs</li>
</ul>
This is a full featured receiver for both audio and HT from Sony, and the best part is all this<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004NHCGJO/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004NHCGJO&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=ramseeker-20"><strong> only costs a little over $200. </strong></a>

But what if you need more features and want to spend a little more money for a Sony receiver to get those features? The Sony mentioned above might be the best budget receiver from Sony, but it may not be the best overall deal. Sometimes, it's best to spend a bit more money on a Sony receiver.

The best part? This Sony receiver even includes an Apple iPod dock, unlike some other brands that force you to buy an iPod dock for your stereo or home theater receiver separately. This is the perfect marriage between the two biggest electronics companies in the world today.

Besides the fact that you can use the iPod with this receiver, the Sony STRDH830 also offers more power (140 watts, instead of 100 watts), another HDMI input (5 vs 4), the ability to upscale analog video to 1080i, an advanced on-screen digital display, Digital audio calibration for perfect sound from all your speakers, and Bravia sync so you only need one remote control when used in conjunction with your Sony Bravia HDTV.

Overall, I think that this is the much better value receiver from the two. Yes, you pay more up front, but the higher end Sony includes an iPod dock, and connectivity options, and I know for me, that's worth much much more than the minimal increase in cost.

Sony receivers for both home theater use and even stereo listening can be great bargains, if you shop around and analyze your needs on what you plan on using the 5.1 receiver for. All come with a plethora of features that include several audio and video inputs, HDMI in and out, and a stereo tuner for AM and FM listening. Of course, being a 5.1 receiver from Sony, that means there are also front speakers, a center speaker and surround speaker connectors to. You'll need to buy your speakers for your sony receiver separately, and there's too many options to list here today. But, let's look at a few Sony 5.1 Receivers and their prices. One of these should be the best Sony receiver for you.

    <h1><a href="/2012/08/when-will-the-imac-2012-release-date-be/">When Will The iMac 2012 Release Date Be?</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>Boy, if there’s one theme for 2012 when it comes to releases of new Apple computers, one word comes to mind and that’s stingy. In recent years we would have had at very least two different models released this year from Apple – more if you consider items like the Apple iPad too.</p>

<p>This time last year, we saw new MacBook Pros in Feb 2011, new Apple iMacs in May 2011 and new Apple Mac Minis in July 2011. Yet here it is at August 2012 and the only new model from Apple is the new MacBook Pro’s (and Air’s too) but for the most part – with the exception of the Apple MacBook Pro Retina Display – all the others considered new are really just the same old notebooks from Apple with faster graphics cards and processors and USB 3.0 ports.</p>

<p>The l<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/new-2011-apple-imac-models-announced/" title="New 2011 Apple iMac Models Announced">ast release date for the iMac</a> was in May 2011, so we’re long overdue for a new consumer desktop of some sort – even if it’s not an iMac, there’s a lot of us who are chained to their desk much more than some other road warriors, and we don’t need to pay the portable tax of more money for a smaller screen and battery power we don’t use when we would much rather appreciate a large display and more comfortable ergonomics a desktop system provides.</p>

<p>That’s a long time between iMac releases and I’m surprised that Apple hasn’t offered up a new iMac for the summer 2012 back to school crowd, or maybe they’re trying to get this market into their portable notebooks like the MacBook Air or MacBook Pro which probably offer a bigger profit margin.</p>

<p>I’m going to guess we will not see an iMac release in August as everybody is on holiday and it’s way too late to catch the back to school market now. This leaves us with September or October. By then, 90+ days will have passed on the MacBook Pro release date and history shows us that Apple tends to save the fall for the iPods as these are the hottest holiday electronics gift for the holidays year after year.</p>

<p>We may have to wait until January 2013 to see an new Apple iMac, and my guess is it will be something revolutionary – like the release of the MacBook Pro Retina Display was for the aging MacBook Pro line. The iMac has essentially been unchanged for years now and for most of us you would be hard pressed to tell one year from another at first glance when comparing iMac models, so it would be very refreshing to see not only a new and improved iMac but also a completely new design too.</p>

<p>My totally uneducated guess is Apple will wait until the new year the iMac release date. They alreada have a bunch of really great products to get them through the remainder of 2012 and I think they should concentrate their efforts on future products that offer more for Apple and their bottom line.</p>

<p>As far as computing technology goes an Apple Desktop of any kind is far from cutting edge in 2012 as more and more of us migrate to using portables, tablets and even smartphones.</p>

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><div style="float: right; margin-right: 5px;">
  <p>

<p>One of the best things about technology is that sooner or later everything becomes affordable and one area where this is especially true is when it comes to hard drive technology. What once was unreachable for the average consumer is now available on sale for under $50.00 depending on the size of the hard drive you are shopping for.</p>

<p>First, we have to determine whether you need an internal 2.5 inch hard drive or an external 2.5 inch hard drive because in most cases they have different uses. Internal 2.5 inch hard drives usually are available as SATA hard drives and are designed to fit in notebook computers, netbooks or some small desktop computers like nettop desktop computers. You may even find a 2.5 inch hard drive in older Apple TV models too.</p>

<p>External 2.5 inch hard drives, are, as the name implies designed to be connected to your computer externally. In most instances, the only difference between an internal hard drive and an external hard drive is that the small portable external hard drives tend to be powered by an USB port and are compatible with Macs or PCs via the USB 2.0 and USB 3.0 port. External 2.5 inch hard drives are the perfect solution for small and portable storage when need to move files from computer to computer or just need extra room for your music, files, photos or movies to be stored. External 2.5 inch hard drives are also a perfect solution as a backup drive too.</p>

<p>**Where to Buy Under $50.00 2.5 inch Hard Drives. **</p>

<p>One of the first places I check for hard drives of any size is at <strong><a>Amazon</a></strong>, as the prices tend to be the lowest and <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/mn/search/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;field-keywords=2.5%20inch%20hard%20drive&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;sprefix=2.5%20inch%2Caps%2C251&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;url=search-alias%3Daps">there’s always a hard drive on sale</a>.</strong> Another place to check for hard drive deals is <a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-1548159-10273954"><strong>Crucial</strong></a>, as they too – after years of selling memory upgrades have ventured into the hard drive arena as well. I find that Amazon is my go-to for anything and not just hard drives and I have found it’s really hard to beat their price when it comes to finding the best 2.5 inch hard drive for the best price.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2012/08/is-8gb-of-ram-enough-for-photo-editing/">Is 8GB of RAM Enough For Photo Editing?</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><div style="float: right; margin-right: 5px;">
  <p>

  </p>
  
  <p>
    &nbsp;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    &nbsp;
  </p>
</div>

<p>I think so.</p>

<p>Most notebooks today and desktops too, ship with about 4GB of RAM and so I recommend you double the memory on your Mac or PC to 8GB – especially for photo editing as some of the more advanced processing like sharpening or unsharp mask in Photoshop take a lot of processing and memory power.</p>

<p>Most photo editing software will run fine on less ram, but with 8GB of RAM being so cheap I think if you do any photo editing, even if you’re just using Apple iPhoto, you would be wise to install the additional memory upgrade.</p>

<p>Minimum memory requirements for the photo editing software just means that the software will open on your Mac or PC and all functions should run. But, they don’t say how fast the work will get done, and if you really want to increase the photo editing or post processing process in your photography workflow, an 8GB ram upgrade is a no brainer if you ask me.</p>

<p>Some Macs, like the new MacBook Pros and the iMacs will even accept 16GB of RAM which of course doubles the ram from 8GB to 16Gb and speeds up the process when it comes to photo editing even more.</p>

<p>Adding more ram allows your Mac or PC to get more work done faster and avoid the spinning pinwheel as you wait for your computer to catch up with your current photo editing task or function and with ram prices being so cheap, you can fill your Mac or PC with memory for much less than you may think.  At the time I write this, 8GB is priced about $50, and 16GB runs you double the price at about $100. If you have a new MacBook Pro released this summer – expect to pay a bit more –  especially if you want to max out the MacBook Pro’s ram to the full 16GB – current street prices cost about $175.00 for 16GB of RAM</p>

  </p>
</div>

<p><strong>In a way, both Crucial and Apple are correct.</strong></p>

<p>Let me explain:</p>

<p>You see, the Apple iMac last saw a refresh over a year ago, in May 2011and at the time 16gB was the maximum memory supported for the Apple iMac due to the fact that only 4GB memory modules in a 1333Mhz configuration were available and even a year ago it would cost you over $100 for 8GB of RAM for the iMac and a whopping $400 if you bought the RAM from Apple directly.</p>

<p>So, when Apple released the iMac they stated that 16GB was the maximum ram you can buy by upgrading all four available memory slots with 4GB DDR 3 SDRAM sodimms: 4x4GB = 16GB</p>

<p>Fast forward to today where you can buy 8GB memory modules for iMac that were not available at the time of the iMac’s release date, so in this case Crucial is correct because if you were to buy 4x8GB DDR3 sodimms for the iMac from Crucial you’d have 32GB installed.</p>

<p>Is It Safe To Install 32GB of RAM into an Apple iMac</p>

<p>Here’s the tricky part. It’s more than likely OK that you’ll be fine installing 32GB of RAM in your iMac and seeing that the recommendation comes from Crucial and not some questionable seller on eBay I’m going to stick my neck out and say you’ll probably be fine with the 32GB in your iMac. After all, Crucial’s big slogan is that crucial memory is guaranteed to work with your computer.</p>

<p>All this said, because Apple states the maximum of 16GB, that’s where I would stop. Why? Because there’s a good chance your warranty is toast if you install more than the amount of RAM recommended by Apple at the time of release.</p>

<p>I know that personally, with my Mac Mini bought in March, I stopped at 8Gb even though I could technically install 16GB in my Mac Mini I choose not to because I didn’t want to void my one year of Applecare and adding more ram than what Apple suggests could do that. Perhaps when I replace the Mac Mini or the Applecare Warranty lapses I may attempt an upgrade of more RAM.</p>

<p>It all comes down to how comfortable you are with voiding your warranty in the rare case that something may go wrong with 32GB of RAM in a 2011 iMac.</p>

<p>I can’t recommend you go higher than 16GB of RAM, regardless of memory upgrade advice from Crucial.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2012/08/can-you-repair-a-macs-ram/">Can You Repair Mac RAM?</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><div style="float: right; margin-right: 5px;">
  <p>
  </p>
  
  <p>
  </p>
  
  <p>
     
    
    <p>
      No.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      If the RAM on your Mac is bad, or has gone bad <strong>it&#8217;s toast.</strong>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Your only option is to replace the RAM with new RAM and if you&#8217;re going to go to the trouble of buying new RAM to replace the dead RAM, I suggest you double (or even triple the RAM too) at the same time for on reason only. RAM is so cheap.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Just like current interest rates the prices have never been so low for so much memory in the over 15 years I have been monitoring RAM prices. It&#8217;s just a few years ago, you would have to pay over $1000 for a 16GB ram upgrade for the iMac and now that same upgrade will cost you nothing at all in comparison &#8211; usually under $100 and even less if you sell your old RAM. (this option may not be available to you if your current RAM upgrade has gone bad)
    </p>
    
    <p>
      But, before you go and replace ram be sure that it&#8217;s gone bad. I know <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/diagnosing-memory-problems-on-your-computer&amp;ei=zBQhUKXIMKK36QHgt4HIBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=unauthorizedredirect&amp;ct=targetlink&amp;ust=1344347092798233&amp;usg=AFQjCNG5ydFAjs1OvQvZX3BSNGyZZVKosg">Microsoft windows offers a memory test option</a>, and you can test the RAM on your Mac too using <a href="http://cdn.command-tab.com/2008/memtest_422.zip">memtest</a>.(direct download link).
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Another option to consider: Is the ram upgrade in your Mac or PC seated properly. I know from personal experience, this has happened to me where I thought I had installed memory on my Mac Mini only to find that I hadn&#8217;t and that the Mac would crash every time I woke from sleep. So I flipped the Mac Mini over, unscrewed the handy plastic cover (if only all Macs allowed such an easy upgrade) and removed and re-installed my memory upgrade ensuring that it was fully installed &#8211; sometimes you have to press hard on the memory module to have the ram seat in the memory upgrade slot correctly.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Once I had re-installed the RAM on my Mac Mini &#8211; all my crashing and startup errors were gone. It wasn&#8217;t the RAM that was bad afterall, it was the crummy installation job by yours truly.  It costs you nothing to try and reinstall your ram in your computer or complete a full memory test so I suggest you check these two items before you spend your hard earned money on RAM you may not need to buy.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      If it turns out your memory really has gone south, the only option is to replace the RAM, but RAM is so cheap it&#8217;s worthwhile upgrading the RAM over replacing your PC. 8Gb of RAM currently is priced about $50 for most computer models and if your Mac or PC can handle it &#8211; I suggest going all the way to 16GB of RAM with street prices running you only about $100 for 16Gb of RAM today.

The Fiio E9 Desktop Headphone Amplifier is designed to give you more ooomph or power for higher end headphones that are more power hungry, but this Headphone Amplifier is a great bargain to get better sound from your computer thanks to the output power of 1watt at 16 Ohms or 800mW at 600 Ohms. This Headphone Amplifier can be used in multiple modifications - either in your home audio system with passive loudspeakers or in your computer area with either headphones or both active and passive speakers

I bought the Fiio E9 Headphone Amp for one reason, and one reason only: I wanted a big and easy to use volume button without having to adjust the computer's volume via keyboard or a mouse. The extra amplification with the highly regarded Burr Brown OPA2134 Op Amps was really just a bonus. Another reason to buy the Fiio E9 is the fact that it plays very nicely with the <a title="Fiio E7 Portable DAC and Headphone Amplifier Review" href="http://www.ramseeker.com/fiio-e7-portable-dac-and-headphone-amplifier-review/">Fiio E7 USB DAC </a> I reviewed recently and results in a powerful headphone amp and DAC <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004M172FY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004M172FY">all for under $200 on sale</a>.

The Fiio E9 Headphone Amplifier is finished in anodized aluminum and feels like a sturdy audio device with a weight of 445 grams, this has a very good feel for it and doesn't feel light and cheesy at all.

<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/JIM_5846.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5581" title="JIM_5846" alt="JIM_5846" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/JIM_5846.jpg" width="1024" height="734" /></a>

The front of the Fiio E9  is where you'll find yourself interacting with the unit the most and the design could not be simpler: A big smooth volume button that takes up almost the entire front of the unit accompanied by two headphone jacks - one for 1/8 (3.5mm) and one for 1/4 (6.35mm) connectors. There's also a power indicator light that when first turned on glows red for one second, and then switches to blue. I'm not sure why they designed this other than to indicate that at first it gets power and then a second later it's ready to use? When you turn the power off to about 7pm (as in photo above) the power light obviously goes out too.

I have two complaints about the Fiio E9's front. One, after a few months the volume got scratchy when adjusting - it probably only needs to be cleaned with  a can of air or possibly contact cleaner, but I have only had this a few months and other items I have owned that have knobs and switches do not seem to be affected by dust  like the volume knob on the Fiio E9.

The other issue I have is the indented ports on the headphone jacks sometimes mean the headphone jack can easily pop out or it can be hard to seat the jack. This holds especially true with the 1/8th mini jack. I hope that on future products Fiio decides to omit this and sit the headphone jack inputs flush, the same as they are for the 3.5mm ports on the back of the unit.

Speaking of the back of the unit, there's more than one way and one port on this headphone amp:

<strong>Line In</strong> This port allows you to hook any line output to the Fiio E9. For example, use one of the outputs on your home stereo connected to this port and you can use the headphone Amp with your home audio stereo if it lacks a built in headphone amplifier and output, and even if it does the Fiio E9 will probably sound better anyway. You will need a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004YEBK66/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004YEBK66">rca to 3.5mm adapter cable</a> (not included) to do this. I wish Fiio had also included a RCA left/right input instead of making the input a 1/8inch headphone jack.

<strong>Pre Output </strong>This allows you to connect the fiio headphone amplifer to an amplifier and use this as a pre-amplifier. You could, for example connect your iPod to the line in port, and connect the pre-out port to an amplifier and use the fiio as a preamplifier. The output from this would be a fixed output, and would bypass the volume control on the Fiio E9. You would use the volume control from your amplifier or if applicable - your source.

<strong>Line Out </strong>This port allows you to output the sound via a 3.5mm port to an amplifier, and unlike the pre-output option, this allows volume adjustment via the volume knob on the front of the headphone amplifier.

<strong>Gain Switch </strong>This is pretty self explanatory. If you have sensitive headphones you won't need the extra gain, but if you have high impedance headphones flip the gain switch to the up position.

<strong>USB Input </strong>This allows you to connect your computer to the headphone amplifier, but this only works if you<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/fiio-e7-portable-dac-and-headphone-amplifier-review/"><strong> buy the Fiio E7</strong></a> as well and connect it to the dock (see the photo below) . If you don't and plan on using it just with a line in, you'll still get the benefits of the headphone amplifier but miss out on the functionality the USB IN provides

<strong>Power Input </strong>Pretty self explanatory - you need to plug it in using the included power adapter (see photo below)

<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/JIM_5843.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5579" title="JIM_5843" alt="JIM_5843" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/JIM_5843.jpg" width="1024" height="680" /></a>

The top of the Fiio E9 offers one connection and it's proprietary and only works with other Fiio DAC's like the Fiio E7.  I have both the DAC and this amp, and it's a match made in heaven as the amplifier charges the fiio E7's battery so when you need to use the Fiio E7 as a portable headphone amplifier you'll be all charged up and ready to go. When the Fiio E7 is plugged in, the amplification comes from the Fiio E9 and not the Fiio E7. You're using the Fiio E7 as a DAC only when docked into the Fiio E9.

<h2><strong>Fiio E9 Specifications </strong></h2>
The biggest specification is more power for your headphones than you could get out of your iPod, smartphone or notebook computer. This is the perfect companion for more power  hungry headphones. The Fiio E9 ships with loads of power. Using Sennheiser HD 25's I am never able than to go louder than 9 o'clock on the dial for comfortable listening. The texas instruments TPA6120 amplifier offers loads of room and with a total harmonic distortion of 0.00014%, the Fiio E9 offers clean sound.

<h2>Fiio E9 Connection Options</h2>
Probably one of the bigger features of the Fiio E9 is the choices on how you can use it. Using the USB IN or Line IN, you have six different connection options: (USB In requires <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003N0XDT4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B003N0XDT4">purchase of Fiio E7</a>)

<strong>Line In Connection Choices</strong>

1. Source via 3.5mm out to 3.5mm line in to 3.5mm or 6.35mm headphones

2. Source via 3.5mm out to 3.5mm line in to 3.5mm line out to amplifier to speakers

3. Source via 3.5mm out to 3.5mm line in to 3.5mm line out to active powered speakers

<strong>USB In Connection Choices</strong>

4. Computer USB to USB IN to 3.5mm or 6.35mm headphones

5. Computer USB to USB IN to 35mm line out to amplifier to speakers

6. Computer USB to USB IN to 3.5mm line out to active speakers
<h2>Summary</h2>
For the money (usually under $100) this is a good looking headphone amplifier that looks good and sounds even better  - especially when paired with the Fiio E7 that it was designed for. I find myself listening to music I haven't played in years, because the sound is so clear than the sound output I have been used to by using my MacBook Pro's headphone amp. I really,really appreciate the old school volume control where a quick tweak of the dial adjusts volume control without me having to stop my workflow to find a sound menu or keyboard button - this feature alone is worth the price and makes computer audio much more enjoyable.

On good recordings, the sound and power output are nothing less than breathtaking. On lesser recordings this device, like a lot of audio devices that are high quality and don't color the sound at all will want you to stop listening, but this is the fault of the original recording and not the Headphone Amplifer. With high quality parts from Texas instruments and with processors and chips usually reserved for high end audiophile equipment costing much more, the Fiio E9 (and matching Fiio E9) could be the best bargain in headphone amplification and listening this year.

The Fiio E9 Desktop Headphone Amplifier is designed to give you more ooomph or power for higher end headphones that are more power hungry, but this Headphone Amplifier is a great bargain to get better sound from your computer thanks to the output power of 1watt at 16 Ohms or 800mW at 600 Ohms. This Headphone Amplifier can be used in multiple modifications - either in your home audio system with passive loudspeakers or in your computer area with either headphones or both active and passive speakers

I bought the Fiio E9 Headphone Amp for one reason, and one reason only: I wanted a big and easy to use volume button without having to adjust the computer's volume via keyboard or a mouse.

Speaking of the back of the unit, there's more than one way and one port on this headphone amp:

<strong>Line In</strong> This port allows you to hook any line output to the Fiio E9. For example, use one of the outputs on your home stereo connected to this port and you can use the headphone Amp with your home audio stereo if it lacks a built in headphone amplifier and output, and even if it does the Fiio E9 will probably sound better anyway.

I find myself listening to music I haven't played in years, because the sound is so clear than the sound output I have been used to by using my MacBook Pro's headphone amp. I really,really appreciate the old school volume control where a quick tweak of the dial adjusts volume control without me having to stop my workflow to find a sound menu or keyboard button - this feature alone is worth the price and makes computer audio much more enjoyable.

On good recordings, the sound and power output are nothing less than breathtaking. On lesser recordings this device, like a lot of audio devices that are high quality and don't color the sound at all will want you to stop listening, but this is the fault of the original recording and not the Headphone Amplifer. With high quality parts from Texas instruments and with processors and chips usually reserved for high end audiophile equipment costing much more, the Fiio E9 (and matching Fiio E9) could be the best bargain in headphone amplification and listening this year.

The Fiio E9 Desktop Headphone Amplifier is designed to give you more ooomph or power for higher end headphones that are more power hungry, but this Headphone Amplifier is a great bargain to get better sound from your computer thanks to the output power of 1watt at 16 Ohms or 800mW at 600 Ohms. This Headphone Amplifier can be used in multiple modifications - either in your home audio system with passive loudspeakers or in your computer area with either headphones or both active and passive speakers

I bought the Fiio E9 Headphone Amp for one reason, and one reason only: I wanted a big and easy to use volume button without having to adjust the computer's volume via keyboard or a mouse. The extra amplification with the highly regarded Burr Brown OPA2134 Op Amps was really just a bonus. Another reason to buy the Fiio E9 is the fact that it plays very nicely with the <a title="Fiio E7 Portable DAC and Headphone Amplifier Review" href="http://www.ramseeker.com/fiio-e7-portable-dac-and-headphone-amplifier-review/">Fiio E7 USB DAC </a> I reviewed recently and results in a powerful headphone amp and DAC <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004M172FY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004M172FY">all for under $200 on sale</a>.

The Fiio E9 Headphone Amplifier is finished in anodized aluminum and feels like a sturdy audio device with a weight of 445 grams, this has a very good feel for it and doesn't feel light and cheesy at all.

<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/JIM_5846.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5581" title="JIM_5846" alt="JIM_5846" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/JIM_5846.jpg" width="1024" height="734" /></a>

The front of the Fiio E9  is where you'll find yourself interacting with the unit the most and the design could not be simpler: A big smooth volume button that takes up almost the entire front of the unit accompanied by two headphone jacks - one for 1/8 (3.5mm) and one for 1/4 (6.35mm) connectors. There's also a power indicator light that when first turned on glows red for one second, and then switches to blue. I'm not sure why they designed this other than to indicate that at first it gets power and then a second later it's ready to use? When you turn the power off to about 7pm (as in photo above) the power light obviously goes out too.

I have two complaints about the Fiio E9's front. One, after a few months the volume got scratchy when adjusting - it probably only needs to be cleaned with  a can of air or possibly contact cleaner, but I have only had this a few months and other items I have owned that have knobs and switches do not seem to be affected by dust  like the volume knob on the Fiio E9.

The other issue I have is the indented ports on the headphone jacks sometimes mean the headphone jack can easily pop out or it can be hard to seat the jack. This holds especially true with the 1/8th mini jack. I hope that on future products Fiio decides to omit this and sit the headphone jack inputs flush, the same as they are for the 3.5mm ports on the back of the unit.

Speaking of the back of the unit, there's more than one way and one port on this headphone amp:

<strong>Line In</strong> This port allows you to hook any line output to the Fiio E9. For example, use one of the outputs on your home stereo connected to this port and you can use the headphone Amp with your home audio stereo if it lacks a built in headphone amplifier and output, and even if it does the Fiio E9 will probably sound better anyway. You will need a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004YEBK66/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004YEBK66">rca to 3.5mm adapter cable</a> (not included) to do this. I wish Fiio had also included a RCA left/right input instead of making the input a 1/8inch headphone jack.

<strong>Pre Output </strong>This allows you to connect the fiio headphone amplifer to an amplifier and use this as a pre-amplifier. You could, for example connect your iPod to the line in port, and connect the pre-out port to an amplifier and use the fiio as a preamplifier. The output from this would be a fixed output, and would bypass the volume control on the Fiio E9. You would use the volume control from your amplifier or if applicable - your source.

<strong>Line Out </strong>This port allows you to output the sound via a 3.5mm port to an amplifier, and unlike the pre-output option, this allows volume adjustment via the volume knob on the front of the headphone amplifier.

<strong>Gain Switch </strong>This is pretty self explanatory. If you have sensitive headphones you won't need the extra gain, but if you have high impedance headphones flip the gain switch to the up position.

<strong>USB Input </strong>This allows you to connect your computer to the headphone amplifier, but this only works if you<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/fiio-e7-portable-dac-and-headphone-amplifier-review/"><strong> buy the Fiio E7</strong></a> as well and connect it to the dock (see the photo below) . If you don't and plan on using it just with a line in, you'll still get the benefits of the headphone amplifier but miss out on the functionality the USB IN provides

<strong>Power Input </strong>Pretty self explanatory - you need to plug it in using the included power adapter (see photo below)

<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/JIM_5843.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5579" title="JIM_5843" alt="JIM_5843" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/JIM_5843.jpg" width="1024" height="680" /></a>

The top of the Fiio E9 offers one connection and it's proprietary and only works with other Fiio DAC's like the Fiio E7.  I have both the DAC and this amp, and it's a match made in heaven as the amplifier charges the fiio E7's battery so when you need to use the Fiio E7 as a portable headphone amplifier you'll be all charged up and ready to go. When the Fiio E7 is plugged in, the amplification comes from the Fiio E9 and not the Fiio E7. You're using the Fiio E7 as a DAC only when docked into the Fiio E9.

For the money (usually under $100) this is a good looking headphone amplifier that looks good and sounds even better  - especially when paired with the Fiio E7 that it was designed for.

<p>The Fiio E7 is a very cheap USB DAC and one of the cheapest USB DACs I have used to date. I bought this to partner with the Fiio E9 (review to come) headphone amplifier as I wanted a knob or dial to adjust the volume on my headphones as opposed to having to control the headphone volume with my computer on my Apple Mac Mini. I find that I’m listening to headphones more and more and I wanted to get better sound out of my Mac. Little did I know how versatile this USB DAC and headphone amplifier is:</p>

<p>The front side of the DAC/Headphone Amp offers what is either a love it, or hate it mirror finish. I’m not keen on it due the fact that the mirror finish attracts fingerprints easily, and if you’re using this more as a portable headphone amp for your ipod or smartphone this could be a consideration.</p>

<p><strong>Fiio E7 Input Options</strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/JIM_5450.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5543" title="JIM_5450" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/JIM_5450.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="507" /></a></p>

<p>As the photo above shows there are three different ways to get your music to/through the USB DAC/Headphone Amp.</p>

<p>The first is an AUX input that consists of a 1/8 headphone jack allowing you to plug any source into the DAC as long as it has the standard mini headphone jack size for it’s output  (or, you can convert it to this. Up next, is a proprietary input jack that can accept accessories such as the Fiio Line out adapter.</p>

<p>There’s also a line in connector that’s proprietary for connecting to the Fiio E9 headphone amplifier. This allows you to easily dock the Fiio E7 into the Fiio E9. According to the website this is supposed to make the Fiio E7 sound even better – probably due to the more power in the Fiio E9</p>

<p>Lastly, the mini USB input for connecting the Fiio E7 to your computer for use as a small headphone amplifier/DAC.</p>

<h2 id="fiio-e7-output-options"><strong>Fiio E7 Output Options</strong></h2>

<p><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/JIM_5448.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5542" title="JIM_5448" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/JIM_5448.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="401" /></a></p>

<p>The flipside of the E7 from Fiio is where you connect your headphones into.  A nice touch is  that there’s two headphone jacks on the top.  If you plan on using this as a USB DAC I suggest you spend the few dollars and invest in the Fiio Line Out Dock  that plugs into the Fiio’s connector on the bottom of the DAC and offers a mini USB input and a true Line Out connector instead of using the headphones.  It’s clear that with the omission of  the line level output as standard equipment that Fiio designed the E7 with the intention of using it as a headphone based unit first and a desktop DAC second. But with a few bucks spent (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004QVNS0S/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004QVNS0S">under $10 online</a>) you can fix this.</p>

<h2 id="fiio-e7-volume-and-controls"><strong>Fiio E7 Volume and Controls</strong></h2>

<p><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/JIM_5447.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5541" title="JIM_5447" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/JIM_5447.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="331" /></a></p>

<p>On the left side of the small DAC and headphone amplifier are four buttons that are pretty self explanatory. Volume Up and Down, Menu Options  and Exit and Power.</p>

<h2 id="fiio-e7-operation-and-menu-options"><strong>Fiio E7 Operation and Menu Options</strong></h2>

<p>Menu Button: Click it once to enter the menu, and twice to enter submenu or to confirm your menu choice. Speaking of choices, the Fiio E7 offers a few different options to control this tiny headphone amp and DAC:</p>

<p><strong>EQ/Bass Boost.</strong> There’s 3 different levels of bass boost from 1 to 3. I found I like the 1 setting.  A true audiophile would have a straight and no processing, but I find for headphone use especially it’s nice to add a bit more bass.</p>

<p><strong>USB Charging </strong>You can choose to turn off the charging when USB is connected.  I don’t see a reason why you would need to switch this off, but there you go.</p>

<p><strong>Sleep Function.</strong> To save battery life set the Fiio E7 to sleep from 10 to 90 minutes at ten minute intervals. Or, turn off the sleep function completely.</p>

<p><strong>Keylock. </strong>Set the Fiio E7 to lock the buttons after a specified time interval  from 20 to 60 seconds.</p>

<p><strong>Maximum Volume. </strong>This is a very useful to save damage to your ears that could be permanent. You can set the volume from 20 to 60 (the maximum volume) I found <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/sennheiser-hd-25-1-headphone-review/" title="Sennheiser HD 25-1 Headphone Review">using my headphones </a> I rarely went past 20 so there’s lots of extra power to spare assuming you’re using relatively sensitive headphones.</p>

<p><strong>Volume Memory </strong>You can choose to remember what volume you last had when you turned off the Fiio E7 or you can choose not to.</p>

<p><strong>USB Audio Decoding</strong> The problem with the digital audio converter in your iPod or notebook is that the part is not the same high quality as the parts inside the Fiio E7.  But with the portable headphone DAC, you can set your computer’ operating system to output the sound via USB which the Fiio can then decode.</p>

<p><strong>Name Brand Chips for Decoding </strong>The Fiio E7 ships with the Texas Instruments 2706 chip for a USB receiver and for the digital to analog conversion it’  powered by Wolfson DAC chips – the WM 8740</p>

<p><strong>Built In Headphone Amplifier and Pre Amp</strong>The Fiio E7 pre-amp section is powered with a Texas Instrument TPA6130A for processing and an AD8692 chip for headphone amplifier section.</p>

<p><strong>Standard 3.5mm Line In Jack </strong>I had already mentioned this earlier as this is a great way not only to hook up your iPod or iPad to the Fiio, but also any item that can outuput sound via a very standard and popular 3.5mm headphone port.</p>

<p><strong>Dual Headphone Outputs </strong>A great way to share your music with others.</p>

<p><strong>Digital Volume Control</strong> offers fast and precise volume adjustment</p>

<p><strong>Built In Equalizer</strong> with 3 different levels of bass boost</p>

<p><strong>Built In Battery </strong>offers up to 80 hours of use,  and full charge from USB port in less than six hours.</p>

<p><strong> Specialized Docking Port </strong>for connecting the Fiio E7 to  the Fiio E9 for even greater versatility and performance.</p>

<p>**Aluminum Case and Small Size **96mm x 55mm x 15.5 mm and weight of just 100g allow it to easily be portable with lightweight and strength of the aluminum case.</p>

<p><strong>USB Charging Option </strong>This allows you to turn off the USB charging for even greater performance by allowing you to turn  off the charging circuitry completely via a menu option. This prolongs the battery lifespan and allows you to achieve even cleaner sound.</p>

<p>**Volume Memory and Maximum Volume **Protect your ears and pick up where you left off when you turn the Fiio E7 back on.</p>

<p><strong>Automatic Keylock  </strong>Assures you won’t bump the buttons when it’s in your pocket</p>

<p><strong>Sleep Timer </strong>Saves you on battery life.</p>

<h2 id="fiio-e7-technical-specifications"><strong>Fiio E7 Technical Specifications </strong></h2>

<h2 id="using-the-fiio-e7"><strong>Using the Fiio E7</strong></h2>

<p>Now that we’ve looked at the specs and stats of the Fiio E7, <strong>how does it sound?</strong></p>

<p>I found the sound to be accurate in both use as a headphone DAC (I used the Fiio E9 for the amplifier section, bypassing the Fiio’s amplification) and as a DAC for my home music server via the USB input and both sound great.</p>

<p>The sound is very accurate so if you have an inferior recording, it will show.  This DAC does not hide or color the sound I have found. For the money I spent on the Fiio E7, this might be the best USB DAC I have used and reviewed to date. With a street price well under the $99.99 MSRP this is a cheap USB DAC and headphone amp that offers great value for those wanting more power and better sound for both their Apple iPods, or home music server systems.</p>

<p>The one thing I could do without is the mirrored finish as it collects fingerprints very easily, Not photographed is the included cleaning cloth to help with this though. Fiio E7 comes with an amazing amount of free accessories too allowing multiple uses and configurations when out and about or use at home with 2 different cases.  It’s light, has oodles of power (I never made it past 1/3) has decent specifications when it comes to distortion and well, just sounds great.</p>

<p>1TB SSD Prices are still in the stratosphere for the time being, but over time we will see the prices for 1 TB ssd drives drop, just like we have seen the prices for 1TB hard drives drop over the years. But I suggest while you wait for the prices for 1TB SSD’s to come down to earth, <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/mn/search/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;field-keywords=hybrid%20drive&amp;url=search-alias%3Daps">check out hard drives that are known as hybrid drives</a></strong></p>

<p>Consider the cost of a brand new SSD drive will set you back close to $2500 (if not more, as you can see from some of the best prices I found for 1TB SSD prices currently for a solid state drive with that much capacity. But what if you could get real close to the performance of an SSD for a fraction of that? You’d be all over it, right? I know I was an that’s why I upgraded my MacBook Pro with a hybrid SSD drive as opposed to buying a SSD. I think I paid a little over $100 for my Seagate Hybrid drive and it works great because after a while it remembers your most accessed data for faster hard drive performance when compared to standard hard drives, but at a fraction of the SSD costs.</p>

<p>If you’re buying a 64GB SSD or even a 128GB SSD you may not care about the hybrid drives as the realSSD prices may be cheaper than a hybrid drive anyway, but for the 1TB size for Solid State Drives, I think you’d be better to spend your money elsewhere. At the prices the Solid State hard drives are demanding for 1TB you could buy a few, if not many computers for the same price.</p>

<p>This is not the cheapest Apple MacBook you can buy today, but I find that unless you need the faster processor speed of the more advanced MacBook Pro this would do the trick for me quite nicely. The cheaper 15 inch MacBook Pro is one of the better deals when it comes to specifications too.</p>

<p>Available with either a 500gb or 750gb hard drive, and a 2.2 Quad Core Intel i7 processor with 4GB of RAM and a 15.4 inch LED display that’s the main attraction for this particular MacBook Pro model. With lesser MacBook Pro models you can buy them cheaper sure, but you pay with a smaller screen size. But for the road warrior, this might not be the best notebook because the 5.6lbs of weight can add up over a long business day. The advantage of this MacBook Pro model is the affordable price and the bigger screen size.</p>

<p>But there’s another 15 inch MacBook Pro that is a little more money but you do get a faster processor with a 2.4GHz processor and a bigger hard drive – the cheaper MacBook Pro ships with a 500GB as standard equipment, but this model ships with bigger 750GB model for those that need more storage space than the less expensive MacBook Pro offers and as you can see above this <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005CWJ3MM/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B005CWJ3MM">15 inch MacBook Pro is on sale for a $200 discount</a></strong>, making this the better deal when you compare the 2.2 Ghz MacBook Pro vs the MacBook Pro 2.4 Ghz models.</p>

<p>With the prices for solid state drives continuing to drop over time, this just might be the year where 128GB SSD drives become affordable for folks like you and I. In the past, due to the newness of the SSD technology, you would pay a very high price for an 128gb solid state drive, or SSD drive of any kind but now they are slowly becoming the default choice when it comes to buying a hard drive, either as a replacement hard drive or installed at the factory in a brand new notebook.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2012/06/hrt-music-streamer-ii-usb-dac-digital-audio-converter-review/">HRT Music Streamer II USB DAC (Digital Audio Converter) Review</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content">I had originally sent an email to High Resolution Technologies for a review sample of this model, and although the president of HRT got back to me, I was to hear from the US distributor of this audio component and I never did hear back and I really wanted to review this product  so I just bought the DAC myself.  I find it mightt just be easier to do it this way than to worry about return dates and shipping costs, especially for inexpensive products like the <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0038O4UFQ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0038O4UFQ">HRT Music Streamer II</a></strong>

<a href="cheapest HRT music streamer"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4778" title="HRT1" alt="" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/HRT1.png" width="630" height="341" /></a>

<strong>Size and Weight</strong>

<strong></strong>One of the very first thing I noticed was the size and weight of the HRT Music Streamer II, and it was much smaller in size than I had anticipated by the online photos I had seen. The actual dimensions of the DAC from High resolution technologies are not much bigger than the photo above, at just  a tad over 5 inches long and 2 inches wide and one inch tall , this is one of the smaller audio components I own.

<strong>Connections</strong>

The output side of the HRT Music Streamer II  is all about the business of connecting the DAC to your  Amplifier or Home Audio reciever, or any other device that offers line in inputs.  Connect some analog interconnects to this and your stereo and you are off to the races.

<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/HRT2.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4780" title="HRT music streamer II analog out. " alt="" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/HRT2.png" width="630" height="422" /></a>
The business end of the HRT Music Streamer II is where the rubber hits the road and allows you to connect the DAC to your computer.  This allows you to do one very important thing and that is to bypass the sound card of  your PC (in my case, a cheap acer netbook) and use the HRT Music Streamer II  to process the digital sound coming out of your computer. The dedicated DAC will sound much better than the sound card installed in your PC as an afterthought.

<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/HRT3.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4781" title="HRT3" alt="" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/HRT3.png" width="630" height="330" /></a>

The Asynchronous USB connection is what you really need to pay attention to, as it's my understanding that this feature allows for the DAC to dictate the speed and control of the data as it processes it in real time. This results in less errors or audio 'jitter' I am led to understand because with this feature the DAC has control of the speed and not the PC.

Also on this end are the different digital sampling rates up to 96k, yet for my use I just want better sound from my CD collection I ripped to ALAC format and just want to have bitperfect output at 16/44.1 so I did not try all the other sampling rates for this review, but the DAC instantly locked on to the redbook CD output signal and had the display change to light up the 44k1 LED. It just worked, right out of the box without having to worry about PC drivers or other issues

<strong>How does the HRT Music Streamer Sound? </strong>

I am just an audio enthusiast looking to get the best sound affordably from my system, I want my speakers to be the most expensive component and this is why I was attracted to the HRT Music Streamer II. I am not looking to be the expert audiophile by any stretch. We just like to listen to music and the sound from the notebook from the PC was far from perfect. With the HRT Music Streamer II the first indicator of how good this product is is that my wife noticed and appreciated the difference in sound with the DAC installed.

I found that for the price this is a welcome addition to our home stereo. Due to system placement issues the system is tucked into a corner and the speakers are too close together for my liking and listening position.  Without the DAC, the system lacked imaging but with the HRT Music Streamer II integrated I found much more stereo imaging and placement of the musical instruments than before.

The bottom line is we are pleased with our purchase as it improved the sound of our home stereo system greatly and affordably, allowing us to replace the CD player with a cheap digital music server and DAC solution. The entire cost for both PC and DAC was well under $400. You don't need to buy an expensive music server to get great sound. A Mac Mini or cheap notebook will serve very nicely as an excellent music server and storage device.

<strong>Features and Benefits of the HRT Music Streamer II
</strong>
<strong>USB Powered</strong>. This means that you don't need any ugly wall warts or power adapters to use this DAC and this is important if you're planning to use the music streamer in a living area where you don't want unsightly cables. This also is pretty energy efficient because all your power needs are served by your PC.

<strong>Size and Weight</strong> - This unit is small and will not take up any rack or shelving space. You could easily hide the HRT music streamer behind an amplifier or even place the DAC on top

<strong>Ease of Use.</strong> This truly is a plug and play device.

<strong>Asynchronous USB</strong>. The DAC dictates the transfer rate for better sound.

<strong>24/96 Sample Rate and Bit Depth.</strong> High Resolution Audio never sounded so good

<strong>Mac and PC compatible.</strong> Use iTunes or Windows Media Player for playback of your audio.

<strong>Summary: </strong> For a little over $100 this is an affordable DAC that sounds really great for the price. Considering you can spend this much on cables to connect the DAC to your amplifier, the fact that you get an actual audio component for the same price might be the best audio bargain of this year. I do wish the DAC were more in the design of standard audio component either full sized or half sized but the small size does make this easy to tuck behind a more standard stereo component.

<strong>Where to Buy the HRT Music Streamer II.</strong> I <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0038O4UFQ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0038O4UFQ">bought mine at Amazon</a></strong> and I ask you to consider the same if you enjoyed this digital review. Prices tend to be the lowest not just for the HRT Music Streamer II but every other audio component too such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00415A3XY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00415A3XY">USB cables</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003USZS8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B003USZS8I">audio interconnects</a> you will need to buy as well to get the best sound out of the HRT Music Streamer II and this will sound much better for say, MacBook Pro Audio via the USB port than if you were to   use the regular headphone output  on the Apple notebook.

<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/HRT3.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4781" title="HRT3" alt="" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/HRT3.png" width="630" height="330" /></a>

The Asynchronous USB connection is what you really need to pay attention to, as it's my understanding that this feature allows for the DAC to dictate the speed and control of the data as it processes it in real time. This results in less errors or audio 'jitter' I am led to understand because with this feature the DAC has control of the speed and not the PC.

Also on this end are the different digital sampling rates up to 96k, yet for my use I just want better sound from my CD collection I ripped to ALAC format and just want to have bitperfect output at 16/44.1 so I did not try all the other sampling rates for this review, but the DAC instantly locked on to the redbook CD output signal and had the display change to light up the 44k1 LED. It just worked, right out of the box without having to worry about PC drivers or other issues

<strong>How does the HRT Music Streamer Sound? </strong>

I am just an audio enthusiast looking to get the best sound affordably from my system, I want my speakers to be the most expensive component and this is why I was attracted to the HRT Music Streamer II. I am not looking to be the expert audiophile by any stretch. We just like to listen to music and the sound from the notebook from the PC was far from perfect. With the HRT Music Streamer II the first indicator of how good this product is is that my wife noticed and appreciated the difference in sound with the DAC installed.

I found that for the price this is a welcome addition to our home stereo. Due to system placement issues the system is tucked into a corner and the speakers are too close together for my liking and listening position.  Without the DAC, the system lacked imaging but with the HRT Music Streamer II integrated I found much more stereo imaging and placement of the musical instruments than before.

The bottom line is we are pleased with our purchase as it improved the sound of our home stereo system greatly and affordably, allowing us to replace the CD player with a cheap digital music server and DAC solution. The entire cost for both PC and DAC was well under $400. You don't need to buy an expensive music server to get great sound. A Mac Mini or cheap notebook will serve very nicely as an excellent music server and storage device.

<strong>Features and Benefits of the HRT Music Streamer II
</strong>
<strong>USB Powered</strong>. This means that you don't need any ugly wall warts or power adapters to use this DAC and this is important if you're planning to use the music streamer in a living area where you don't want unsightly cables. This also is pretty energy efficient because all your power needs are served by your PC.

<strong>Size and Weight</strong> - This unit is small and will not take up any rack or shelving space. You could easily hide the HRT music streamer behind an amplifier or even place the DAC on top

<strong>Ease of Use.</strong> This truly is a plug and play device.

<strong>Asynchronous USB</strong>. The DAC dictates the transfer rate for better sound.

<strong>24/96 Sample Rate and Bit Depth.</strong> High Resolution Audio never sounded so good

<strong>Mac and PC compatible.</strong> Use iTunes or Windows Media Player for playback of your audio.

<strong>Summary: </strong> For a little over $100 this is an affordable DAC that sounds really great for the price. Considering you can spend this much on cables to connect the DAC to your amplifier, the fact that you get an actual audio component for the same price might be the best audio bargain of this year. I do wish the DAC were more in the design of standard audio component either full sized or half sized but the small size does make this easy to tuck behind a more standard stereo component.

Prices tend to be the lowest not just for the HRT Music Streamer II but every other audio component too such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00415A3XY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00415A3XY">USB cables</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003USZS8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B003USZS8I">audio interconnects</a> you will need to buy as well to get the best sound out of the HRT Music Streamer II and this will sound much better for say, MacBook Pro Audio via the USB port than if you were to   use the regular headphone output  on the Apple notebook.
I had originally sent an email to High Resolution Technologies for a review sample of this model, and although the president of HRT got back to me, I was to hear from the US distributor of this audio component and I never did hear back and I really wanted to review this product  so I just bought the DAC myself.  I find it mightt just be easier to do it this way than to worry about return dates and shipping costs, especially for inexpensive products like the <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0038O4UFQ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0038O4UFQ">HRT Music Streamer II</a></strong>

<strong>Size and Weight</strong>

<strong></strong>One of the very first thing I noticed was the size and weight of the HRT Music Streamer II, and it was much smaller in size than I had anticipated by the online photos I had seen. The actual dimensions of the DAC from High resolution technologies are not much bigger than the photo above, at just  a tad over 5 inches long and 2 inches wide and one inch tall , this is one of the smaller audio components I own.

<strong>Connections</strong>

The output side of the HRT Music Streamer II  is all about the business of connecting the DAC to your  Amplifier or Home Audio reciever, or any other device that offers line in inputs.  Connect some analog interconnects to this and your stereo and you are off to the races.

    <h1><a href="/2012/06/cheapest-laptop-deals/">Cheapest Laptop Deals</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>I like to shop for memory upgrades being the first thing I tend to look for, but there are times when you need to buy a brand new laptop and with the prices for notebooks continually dropping as more and more features get added over time.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007G7CO2C/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B007G7CO2C">The Acer Aspire is one of many cheap laptops available today</a><br />
**<br />
**Where to Find The Best Laptop Deals</strong></p>

<p>I’ve always like the good folks at <a href="http://www.dealnews.com">dealnews</a> to help me find a deal on PC notebooks especially, and if you’re interested in Apple products, <a href="http://www.macprices.net">Mac Prices</a> does a great job on updating you on the latest Apple deals on Apple Notebooks  and other Apple products too.</p>

<p>eBay is a great place to look for a notebook deal, especially if you can manage the idea of buying a used notebook – folks upgrade their notebooks all the time and when they do they often sell the old notebooks on eBay or Craigslist which is another great  place to look for notebooks.</p>

<p>I find the easiest way to find a great deal on a notebook is to just shop at Amazon, and the last time I was in the market for a notebook,  I just used their best selling notebooks feature to scan the most popular notebook deals of the hour as the list  continually gets updated over time  and if it’s a popular notebook there’s usually a reason and others have bought the exact same notebook and kept it – The deal sites for laptops and the like may offer and calculate great discounts on notebooks, but that doesn’t mean it’s a good notebook. It means it’s a cheap laptop.</p>

<p>Amazon offers the best prices on Laptops continually. Here’s a few of the current best selling cheap notebook computers:</p>

<p>The Acer Aspire AS5750Z-4835 15.6-Inch Laptop offers a really good price and is one of the cheapest laptops you can buy.</p>

<p>The ASUS A53U-EH11 is another cheap laptop on sale today:</p>

<p>And the new Samsung Chromebook is another way to get into a problem free laptop:</p>

<p>These are just 3 of the cheapest and best selling laptops you can buy today. See the best selling laptops for <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/electronics/565108/?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">up to the minute laptop deals</a></strong>.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2012/06/what-is-the-best-affordable-laptop/">What is the Best Affordable Laptop?</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>As newer computer models change over time, so will this list but I thought I’d take time to research some cheaper laptops and what’s currently available on sale. (Of course, you’ll need to add ram to your laptop). You will note I’m not  listing the best selling laptops or even the cheapest laptops because I have found that sometimes spending a bit more money is worth it when laptop shopping.</p>

<div style="float: right; margin-right: 5px;">

<div style="float: right; margin-right: 5px;">
</div>

<p><strong>What is affordable?</strong></p>

<p>If you want a Mac Laptop you’re going to need <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/apple-laptops-price-list/" title="Apple Laptops Price List">close to $1000 to play</a>, and if you don’t have that kind of money then you’re forced to look at a Windows notebook. There was a time that I would loathe to recommend a PC laptop but with Windows 8 on the horizon and a <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/release-preview">consumer preview available</a> I may have to change my tune. You can also install <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a> on the Windows PC and with a bit of tweaking you can get a notebook that feels real close to the Mac OS for a fraction of the price.</p>

<p><strong>Laptops Under $400</strong></p>

<p>I’ve already written about $400 laptops and there’s lots to choose from. Three current  best sellers are:</p>

<p>The Acer Aspire AS5750Z-4835 is one notebook worth a look and offers all the basics of a cheap notebook in a 15.6 inch package with 4GB RAM, 500GB hard drive and a 15.6 inch display.</p>

<p>The Asus A53U-EH11 is another cheap laptop that’s feature packed with and AMD dual core processor, 3GB of RAM and a 320GB hard drive and at under $350.00, this is one of the cheapest notebooks you can buy today.</p>

<p>Don’t discount a chromebook either. The Samsung series 5 chromebook is an option as there’s less hassle with OS stuff and viruses. If you live in a web browser, this could be the perfect notebook for you.</p>

<p><strong>Laptops $500 to $1000</strong></p>

<div>
</div>

<p>If screen real estate is what you need the HP g7-1310us is a hard deal to beat for a 17 inch notebook, especially for the price of just over $500.</p>

<p>If the thought of lugging around a big screen notebook all day brings shivers up your spine, check out the Dell Inspiron i14RN-1227BK. At just under $500 this 14 inch beauty shaves weight off the traditional laptop and is cheaper than an Ultrabook.</p>

<p>And speaking of Ultrabooks, now that they are dropping in price, they are a much cheaper alternative to an Apple offering and are the cheapest and are the best laptops and notebooks you can buy today.</p>

<p>These notebooks are just a taste of what’s available when shopping for a laptop and all I would consider affordable laptops.</p>

<p>I don’t know why, but next to some pretty shady memory stores (that I don’t list), the next area where you can get into trouble when shopping online is when you buy a digital camera.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004V4IWKG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004V4IWKG"><strong>The Nikon D5100 is the best selling digital camera</strong></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004V4IWKG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004V4IWKG"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4739" title="Nikon D5100 deal" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Screen-Shot-2012-05-31-at-8.42.17-AM.png" alt="Best Selling Digital Camera" width="310" height="304" /></a></p>

<p>You want to be sure you’re buying a camera that comes in the original box, with all the accessories and packaging too and most important  of all, the warranty card.</p>

<p>You know the saying about how if the price is too good to be true, it is. Well, this applies to camera buying as well and especially with the warranties missing from some camera manufacturers you need to certain that the camera you buy will be supported, especially when you buy a digital SLR camera that tends to be pretty expensive, and why when you shop online for digital slr’s the prices you see from some online vendors can sure be enticing.</p>

<p>But in the long term, they’re not. Some sellers will sell you just the camera body and take out all the accessories, and some online stores try to sell you gray market cameras. These are cameras that were manufactured for one market, but end up being sold in another. An example  would be the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0076AYNXM/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0076AYNXM">Nikon D800 </a>–  a very popular and very expensive digital SLR on sale right now, and a perfect candidate for a grey market SLR.</p>

<p>You want to ensure the Nikon D800 (or any camera you buy) is manufactured for market intended. Differences may be slight or not at all, but if you buy a grey market camera it will not have any warranty. In my case, I want Nikon USA to support my Nikon SLR in the case there’s a problem with the camera.</p>

<p>It’s pretty easy to buy a camera online safely. Buy from trusted vendors you have heard of. If Jim’s Camera  store is offering a too good to be true discount on the camera – guess what? it really is  too good to be true.</p>

<p>I have found that when buying cameras online, <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/electronics/281052/?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">Amazon</a></strong>  continues to offer the best selling cameras at the best  prices and you can be sure you are buying a camera with all the accessories and warranty support you need.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2012/05/where-to-buy-apple-computers-refurbished/">Where To Buy Apple Computers Refurbished</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>These computers are usually returned computers for various reasons that have been inspected by Apple, cleaned and then put back out on sale at a discounted price. If you’re patient and wait for the perfect refurbished Mac to appear you can save money on what essentially may be a brand new Mac.</p>

<p>One way to get a better price or great deal on an Apple computer is to buy a refurbished Apple Computer.</p>

<p><a href="http://store.apple.com">Apple</a> of course is an excellent source for refurbished Macs and also other products too from Apple such as refurbished iPads and iPods too.</p>

<p>Examples of refurbished Macs currently available are:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005CWJ76O/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B005CWJ76O">Apple MacBook Pro 17 inch.</a> Save $200<br />
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005CWIVYI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B005CWIVYI">Apple MacBook Pro 13.3 inch</a> Save $100<br />
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005CWJ1DI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B005CWJ1DI">Apple MacBook 15 inch</a> Save $120.00</p>

<p>**Refurbished iPads<br />
** Another great way to get an iPad deal on an essentially new Apple iPad is to buy refurbishe too, and here’s a few examples of the savings you may expect when compared to the prices of a brand new Apple iPad</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00365F6EG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00365F6EG">Apple iPad (1st Generation 32GB Wifi)</a> Save $70.00<br />
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0047DVWQM/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0047DVWQM"> Apple iPad 2 (32GB Wifi) </a>Save $87.00<br />
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00365F6G4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00365F6G4"> Apple iPad (1st Generation 64GB Wifi)</a> Save $170.00</p>

<p>As you can see from the few examples above, these are pretty good deals on Apple certified and refurbished products and it’s a great way to save money when buying  Apple computers  as they can be expensive when compared to other PC’s using Windows.</p>

<p>Mac Mall is another source you should  check for deals on Apple products as I find that they offer more selection than even the Apple Store and they tend to offer a deal of some sort too –  something that Apple does not, save for the discounted refurbished price.</p>

<p>Buying refurbished Apple Products is one of the better ways to save on Apple products, regardless of whether you’re in the market for an iPad, or Apple Macintosh computer.</p>

		<div class="post-content"><p>Recently, I wrote about memory finders being a perfect way to buy more memory for your Mac or PC  if you’re looking to buy more memory, but what if you just want to find out what kind of RAM you have installed in your desktop or notebook computer already?</p>

<p>On the Mac, it’s easy.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Go to the Apple Menu and select About This Mac</p>

  <li>
    <p>You’ll see the amount of memory and type of RAM</p>

  <li>
    <p>If you click ‘more info’  there’ s a memory tab that displays the amount of ram installed, how many slots are in use by the ram installed and the type of RAM installed.</p>

<p>If you’re more interested in finding out what brand of RAM you have, then the only way I know how to do this is to physically inspect the RAM as most RAM brands are not displayed in any memory information tool, regardless of operating system.</p>

<p>My Mac Mini shipped with Hynix RAM when I went to replace the 4GB of Mac Mini RAM with 8GB (I went with <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/mn/search/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;field-keywords=CRUCIAL%20MEMORY&amp;url=search-alias%3Daps">Crucial from Amazon</a></strong> as my wife was buying some books at the same time and we get free shipping)  but the Hynix memory upgrades worked just fine for me, as does the Crucial upgrades.</p>

<p>When shopping for ram upgrades I would be more concerned that you have the correct memory speed and  type installed as opposed to buying ram brands. RAM either works or it doesn’t and all ram built or sold by the memory stores I list will do you just fine and come with money back guarantees in the rare event there is a problem.</p>

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>Most, if not all RAM you buy today is tested by the memory manufacturer or reseller before it gets shipped to you or installed in your computer when you buy it, but even with these failsafe measurements in place, it does happen that  sometimes your computer will start to act up and one cause of the PC’s troubles could be the RAM has gone bad.</p>

<p>There’s also the chance that the operating system you are running doesn’t like to run the memory you have installed. This is rare though and usually happens when an OS update is performed.  It’s been a decade or more since I’ve seen RAM go bad due to and OS change.</p>

<p>But, <strong>RAM does go bad</strong>, as does hard drives (which is  why you should always have a backup too) and there’s many free ram testers out there to help you determine if your RAM has gone bad or not.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.memtest86.com/">MemTest</a>. This memory testing software is completely free to use and the most popular memory testing tools to use today.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/diagnosing-memory-problems-on-your-computer">Windows Memory Diagnostic.</a>. If you’re on a Windows PC, this software comes built in to the operating system so you don’t need to download anything.  Just click start, control panel and search for memory in the search box and click ‘diagnose your computer’s  memory problems’</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>These two programs will help you determine the health of your installed memory upgrades on your Mac or PC. If you do find you have bad RAM, contact the computer memory manufacturer to determine if your installed RAM applies for a warranty replacement as most memory stores today offer a lifetime guarantee  on the ram upgrades they sell.</p>

<p>Memory Upgrade for the average user can be confusing to the average consumer. Sure, there’s propellor heads or those interested in technology and memory upgrades to know the difference between DDR2 and DDR3 SDRAM, but for the customer that does all their computer shopping at Best Buy the ram you need to buy for you notebook or desktop computer can become quite confusing.</p>

<p>That’s why the memory manufacturers and memory stores usually offer some tool online at their website to help you get the right memory upgrade. These tools can be called memory finders, or memory configurators or some other name but they essentially do the same thing and match your computer model with the RAM you need to buy. This is something you won’t find at one of the biggest memory store – Amazon. If you were searching for the best digital cameras you would find a tool to use but not for memory upgrades for your Mac or PC.</p>

<p>Most of the memory finders you will come across work as an online form and you choose your computer manufacturer, computer model, and finally – computer model name where the program redirects you to the proper ram upgrade for you computer. All you then have to do is place your memory upgrade order to complete your memory upgrade sale.</p>

<p>Of course, there’s other ways to find the right memory upgrade for your computer and another (and in my opinion, easier) way to get your ram upgrades is to just offer a search engine – you type in keywords and the search trys to match the memory to what you type. This has both advantages and disadvantages because if you fail to search correctly you may miss out on finding the right memory for your PC.</p>

<p>Lastly, one other way to find the correct memory upgrade is to download software to your PC or Mac that will scan your computer for the right memory for your notebook or desktop computer. Crucial Technology is one memory store that offers this method and also guarantees that your ram will be correct using this tool.</p>

<p>Sometimes a Memory Store may choose to specialize in one PC brand rather than trying to cater to every PC desktop and notebook ever made. Other World Computing comes to mind as an online store that has chosen to build sales and relationships with Apple Macintosh customers over PC users with Windows based machine.</p>

<p>Whatever method you choose, I suggest you use a memory finder to get the best deal on memory upgrades that are guaranteed to work with your computer model.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2012/05/where-to-buy-a-4gb-ram-stick/">Where To Buy a 4GB RAM Stick</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>They’re usually not called ‘ram sticks’ and more commonly known as memory modules or ram upgrades but whatever you call them there’s a very good chance that if you’re looking to upgrade your ram for either your desktop computer or notebook or laptop you need to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/mn/search/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;field-keywords=4gb%20RAM&amp;url=search-alias%3Daps">buy 4GB of RAM </a>. Heck you may even need to buy two 4gb memory modules to max out the memory on your Mac or PC.</p>

<p>I’m showing my age here, but I remember when 1-800-4-Memory first released 1GB ram (for the iBook maybe, I can’t remember) and the price for 1GB of RAM at that time was over $2000. I thought for certain it was a typo because even though ram upgrades were much more expensive back then two thousand dollars for a memory upgrade seemed almost criminal.</p>

<p>Now, you can buy 4GB of RAM for about twenty dollars – a fraction of that price and 4x the memory capacity too.</p>

<p>This goes to show you how <strong>cheap you can buy a 4GB RAM stick this year</strong> as opposed to just a few years ago when 8GB of RAM would cost more than the machine it was going into. It’s different times indeed.</p>

<p>If you’re in the market for 4GB of ram you may want to have a look at 16GB of ram for your Mac or PC too as some computer manufacturers offer the ability to max out your machine at 16GB. On desktop computers, this isn’t that big of a deal as they usually offer 4 or more memory upgrade slots to allow for 4GBx4 ram upgrades, but for notebooks the 16GB usually has to happen by using two 8GB memory modules and you will in most cases have to replace the factory ram too with the bigger 8GB ram upgrades.</p>

<p>For the best prices on 4GB RAM, notebook memory seems to be the most popular and with some notebooks under $400 you want to be sure you get a good deal on RAM too.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2012/05/the-dell-memory-selector-you-can-get-a-better-deal-on-memory-upgrades/">The Dell Memory Selector: You Can Get A Better Deal on Memory Upgrades</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>This should be common knowledge to anybody who’s even remotely familiar with computer memory but in case you’ve missed it – you can do better on ram prices when you buy ram elsewhere.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://accessories.us.dell.com/sna/memconfig.aspx?c=us&amp;l=en&amp;s=bsd&amp;cs=04">Dell Memory Selector </a> is really handy for finding out what memory upgrades you need for dell both new and old and over the years, there have been a lot of dell computers released and it’s always a good ideal to add ram to whatever model you choose but the ram prices from Dell seem to be high when you compare the prices on memory upgrades from other memory manufacturers:</p>

<p>Let’s use an example: The Dell Inspiron 15 is one of the most popular Dell laptops today and to buy <a href="http://accessories.us.dell.com/sna/category.aspx?c=us&amp;l=en&amp;s=bsd&amp;cs=04&amp;category_id=4325&amp;mfgpid=224725&amp;chassisid=-1">memory for the Dell Inspiron 15 from Dell </a>is pretty expensive when you compare the prices to other memory manufacturers and retailers.</p>

<p>Dell charges $38 for 4GB of RAM currently which really is a lot more realistic than the $400 Apple wants for the ram upgrades for their MacBook Pro lineup. Assuming you will need to buy two 4GB DDR3 1333Ghz laptop memory modules to maximize the memory on your Dell, you’re looking at just under $80.00 to max out the dell notebook ram if you buy direct from Dell.</p>

<p>Compare this to <strong><a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT2KIT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1339">memory from Crucial Technology</a></strong> (or others in the pricing table for dell notebook memory below) where you can buy the exact same upgrade for a bit over $40.00 currently. (again, prices may change – see prices below for current dell notebook ram prices ).</p>

<p>That’s a half price discount, or close to – all by doing about 30 seconds of research and looking for alternative sources for Dell Memory Upgrades, other than buying ram from Dell Directly.</p>

<p>Now, if saving money on RAM is not your first and foremost concern, and you want Dell to install RAM in your new Dell notebook than the extra $40 or so you pay for RAM from dell compared to other cheaper sources may be worth it as now you don’t have to install the Dell memory upgrade yourself and can let a certified Dell Technician install the ram into your brand new Dell notebook.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2012/05/web-hosting-shopping-a-look-at-11-web-hosting-plans/">Web Hosting Shopping: A Look at 1&#038;1 Web Hosting Plans</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>There was a time when I didn’t really care about web hosting and happily paid three thousand dollars a year or more for a dedicated web server to host this site (and others), but as the demand for RAM has leveled off and the ram prices have dropped, I am starting to look for ways to save money on my annual web hosting bill.</p>

<p>**I’m with <a href="http://www.pair.com">Pair</a>. **</p>

<p>A few years back, I switched platforms to use wordpress instead of my ever so more complicated html setup. I’ve had a few complaints about tracking the ram prices for the older macs, but my research shows you folks are not looking for ram for older Macs so I now just concentrate on the newer Apple computer models as those are the Macs people are buying and need to upgrade the RAM on. I can speak from personal experience that the only time I have ever bought RAM is when I needed to upgrade the RAM on a brand new Mac – most recently being an Apple Mac Mini I upgraded with 8gb of RAM.</p>

<p>Anyway, back to the web hosting: In an effort to cut costs I transferred this site to shared hosting and except for the odd burp in service, I don’t really have any complaint with them except for the fact that for shared hosting – at $85.00 a month they’re kind of pricey when I compare other web hosting packages available online.</p>

<p>This will, I think be the first in a series of web hosting plan comparisons I hope to do as I can’t help myself – I like to shop and get the best price on stuff, whether it’s web hosting or memory upgrades and 1&amp;1 web hosting is the first host I found alphabetically so I’ll start there:</p>

<p><strong>1&amp;1 Web Hosting Plans</strong></p>

<p>The good folks at 1&amp;1 offer a few plans but the best web hosting from 11 web hosting costs just a little over 3 bucks a month. Even with the 25% discount I got from Pair networks that’s still a significant savings over the $80 a month I am paying now for web hosting. a</p>

<p>I really don’t need a lot for my web hosting needs, as this is just a blog and I bet that any old host would work for my site and traffic load. I would need some mysql databases for the wordpress databases and unlimited traffic and storage space that this cheap web hosting plan from 11 web hosting offers.</p>

<p>I don’t care less about free domain names, email accounts, ssl certificates and or dual hosting. I may be inclined to upgrade the hostin to their business web hosting as opposed to their personal plan, only for the fact that the performance may be better and I think the faster ramseeker is the better.</p>

<p>I can always pay more for web hosting later too, as I have yet to find any business that will not take more money than you are currently paying.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2012/05/what-is-the-best-selling-laptop-brand-of-2012/">What is the Best Selling Laptop Brand of 2012?</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>A lot of times, the best selling notebook of the year is also going to be the cheapest notebook of the year too as you can get a lot of notebook for very little money these days, and if you’re just going to be surfing the internet or writing documents with your laptop you don’t need to buy a high powered gaming notebook for that to happen. If this is the case, then all you need to do is buy the cheapest notebook you can buy.**<br />
Price<strong>When shopping for a new laptop, one way to decide on what laptop to buy this year is to take the easy way out and **just  buy the laptop everybody else is buying</strong>.  This sure takes the guesswork out of having to decide on what notebook to buy but there are other factors to consider when notebook shopping in 2012:</p>

<p><strong>Screen Size </strong></p>

<p>The best sellers in the notebook department also tend to be those with the smallest screens as screen size determines price more than any other component on a notebook computer today. If you want a bigger screen notebook, be prepared to pay for the additional  screen real estate.</p>

<p><strong>Power</strong></p>

<p>Fast  Processors are going to cost more and likely not as popular due to price, than if you were to buy a cheaper notebook computer with a slower chip.</p>

<p><strong>RAM and Hard Drives</strong></p>

<p>When notebook shopping you want to  be sure to buy the notebook with the most RAM and hard drive space. In 2012, that translates to RAM with 4GB and about 500GB hard drive space for entry level notebooks – especially when you’re shopping for notebooks under $500.</p>

<h2 id="best-laptop-brands-in-2012">Best Laptop Brands in 2012</h2>

<p>I’ll try to keep this updated, and this will easily change over time, but you really can’t go wrong with the following notebook computer brands:</p>

<p><strong>Apple </strong></p>

<p>You’ll pay a premium for this brand, and it’s arguable whether an Apple notebook is worth the extra money  but these notebooks are constantly on the best selling notebook lists year after year.</p>

<p><strong>Lenovo</strong> is another brand that’s popped up recently and it’s probably doe in part to the fact that you can buy their laptops so cheaply – some are priced as low as $399. Try getting a Mac notebook for that little.</p>

<p><strong>Acer</strong> ranks number  3 currently and I really don’t know why as they tend to have a very extensive lineup of notebooks this year – from more traditional notebooks to the ultra light ultrabooks. If you had to pick any notebook brand, I would say that Acer  will have a laptop that would suit your needs.</p>

<p>**HP **Personally, I have had bad luck with a HP notebook so  I am reluctant to recommend this brand, but I suppose I shouldn’t let one bad apple ruin the bunch</p>

<p><strong>Asus</strong> is a brand of notebook I haven’t used much but they are in the top ten best selling notebooks  right now so I must include this brand too.</p>

<p>Unless you consider Apple, all the others ship with Windows 7 as the defacto operatings system and of course, I suggest  you max out the ram in all of them.</p>

<p><strong>Where To Buy The Best Laptop Brands?</strong></p>

<p>I have a hard time beating  any price on any notebook and suggest you <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/electronics/565108/?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957"><strong>buy your 2012 notebook at Amazon</strong> </a>as they stock every item under the sun and have the best notebook prices I have seen this year to date.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2012/05/what-is-a-good-amount-of-ram/">What is a Good Amount of RAM?</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>8GB  of RAM is enough for most of  us.</p>

<p>There was a time when ram mattered more and I’m loathe to say this  because I feed my family with the stuff – there’s a good chance the RAM installed  is enough. In 2012, and on a notebook computer that means you’ll usually have about 4GB of ram installed, or if you end up buying an older computer you may have 1GB of RAM or maybe 2.</p>

<p>Netbooks are another story. In an effort to keep the cost of the netbook down  the computer manufacturers skimp on RAM and if there were ever an increase in performance for your netbook that’s  super cheap  then adding RAM is the ticket.</p>

<p>But if you’re surfing and blogging and maybe running a small video or photo editing with your notebook (or desktop too) than you will be OK with 8GB of RAM.</p>

<p><strong>What about 16GB? </strong></p>

<p><strong>**Some notebooks today ship with 4GB and could be upgraded to 16GB. The Apple MacBook Pro is one such notebook. The problem I find with buying and installing 16GB of RAM  into your notebook is that even with the recent **<a href="http://www.amazon.com/mn/search/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;field-keywords=16gb%20notebook%20memory&amp;url=search-alias%3Delectronics&amp;sprefix=16gb%20notebook%2Celectronics%2C213">price drops on 16GB notebook memory</a> </strong>you still end up paying more for 16GB of RAM.</p>

<p>A case study that’s far from scientific is I am writing this on a<strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/mn/search/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;field-keywords=16gb%20notebook%20memory&amp;url=search-alias%3Delectronics&amp;sprefix=16gb%20notebook%2Celectronics%2C213#/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias=electronics"> 2011 Mac Mini  </a></strong> and with 8Gb installed I still have 3GB of RAM free. I have over a dozen applications  open and to be honest I find no need to buy more RAM than 8GB.</p>

<p>This will change over time as the 16GB prices keep on dropping and dropping, it’s only a small matter of time before you can buy 16GB of RAM, but for now – <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002YUF8ZG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002YUF8ZG">8GB of RAM will do you just fine</a>.</strong></p>

    <h1><a href="/2012/05/macbook-air-vs-macbook-pro-for-2012/">MacBook Air vs MacBook Pro for 2012.</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>Way back in August of 2011 I wrote about whether <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/should-i-buy-a-macbook-pro-now-in-august-or-should-i-wait-for-the-macbook-pro-2012/" title="Should I Buy a 2011 MacBook Pro Now in August, or should I wait for the MacBook Pro 2012?">I should buy a new MacBook Pro today</a> or whether I should wait for the 2012 MacBook Pros to arrive (I’ll wait – there has to be a new MacBook Pro released any day now)</p>

<p>But this got me thinking. What if you can’t wait to buy a MacBook Pro and you need one now? Do you go with the MacBook Air instead of MacBook Pro?</p>

<p>**2012 MacBook Air vs MacBook Pro **</p>

<p>To start, I’m comparing the 13 inch versions of these models as there isn’t a 15 inch MacBook Air and it wouldn’t surprise me if Apple discontinued the 17 inch MBP any day now. So this leaves us comparing the 2012 Apple MacBook Pro vs the 2012 MacBook Air – both with 13.3 inch displays.</p>

<p>**Advantages of MacBook Air<br />
**</p>

<p>Weight. It weigh less and for a portable computer this may be your buying decision right there.<br />
Hard Drive Speed. The SSD drive smokes the standard hard drive in the MacBook Pro<br />
Newer Technology when it comes to Airport speed and bluetooth technologies.</p>

<p><strong>Advantages of MacBook Pro</strong></p>

<p>Weight. I don’t care what the marketers would like you to believe – that extra pound and a half is a lot when it’s digging into your shoulder<br />
Price. The MacBook Pro is cheaper by $100.<br />
Speed. The MadcBook Pro is faster with a 2.4GHz processor compared to the MacBook Air’s 1.7GHz<br />
Memory.You can upgrade the MacBook Pro with more RAM. the MacBook Air you’re stuck with the default 4GB for the lifetime of the computer.<br />
Optical Drive. The MacBook Pro has one.<br />
Facetime HD video camera<br />
Thunderbolt port<br />
Backlit Keyboard<br />
Way more connections on the MacBook Pro. The Air is limited to thunderbolt and USB 2.0 and headphone and microphone.</p>

<p>As you can see, the advantage of the Air over the Pro this year so far is far lighter and the zippy SSD drive.</p>

<p>If you can handle the extra weight of the MacBook Pro, <strong>that’s the one I would buy</strong>. It’s $100 cheaper and less if you <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005CWIVYI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B005CWIVYI">buy the MacBook Pro at Amazon</a></strong>. It all depends on how you plan on using your notebook. For me, I plug the notebook into a LED display and external hard drive and only unplug it for couch surfing or the odd trip out for coffee for a change of scenery.</p>

<p>I vote for the MacBook Pro.</p>

Almost every notebook pc built today in 2012 will use and accept DDR3 notebook memory and this applies to all brands of laptops – even the Mac vs PC – it doesn’t matter.

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>I spent $22.00 on my Dell Music Server to be exact.</p>

<p><img class=" wp-image-4253 " title="Cheap Music Server" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/JIM_3337-1024x680.jpg" alt="Dell Music Server" width="450" /></p>

<p>Over the years one might say my CD collection has grown some. I’m closing in on 1000 CD’s in my collection and I have a problem: My wife doesn’t like the space it takes. Thus my search began on how to manage my CD collection and at the same time be able to access all my music easily without the bulk and space requirements of a physical CD collection taking up space in our main living area, so my search began for a cheap music server to eventually replace my CD’s and CD Player.</p>

<p><strong>I really want to Buy a Mac Mini ** But like a lot of other folks, money is tight and **<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004YLCLM6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004YLCLM6">spending almost $600 on a Mac Mini</a></strong> really isn’t in the cards for now as there’s home repairs and other stuff like the mortgage that currently keeps our fiscal attention so for the time being, the Mac Mini has to wait. Paired with an iPhone or iPad this really could be the best way to manage your music for under $1000 <em>**</em> <em>*But what if I could make a cheap music server for a fraction of that cost? ** <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/JIM_3341.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-4255" title="JIM_3341" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/JIM_3341-1024x680.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="" /></a> *I did have to <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com">add more memory</a> to get my cheapo dell up and running </em> A bit of searching led me to <a href="http://www.vortexbox.org">vortexbox.org</a> and this is music server software that’s linux based and offers a free and easy way to make a music server out of pretty much any old PC you’ve got kicking around.  I could build a PC for this purpose  but by the time you’ve got the PC built you’re over $300 or more into it  and by that point I’d rather save my pennies and buy what I really want – a Mac Mini. (This might be a good topic to explore further though)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.vortexbox.org"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4271" title="VortexBox GUI Interface" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Screen-Shot-2012-04-30-at-7.43.48-PM-600x648.png" alt="" width="600" height="648" /></a></p>

<p> </p>

<p><em>The web user interface on the vortexbo</em></p>

<p>**So I searched eBay for some cheap desktop computers and found a <a href="http://www.ebay.com">Dell Optiplex 280 on ebay</a> that’s obviously been put to use in an office environment but is now off lease. It’s an older Intel P4 processor running  at 2.8GHz but it came with a fresh install of Windows XP, and 512mb of RAM and a 40GB hard drive – enough power to allow me to test the vortexbox software and see if it’s for me and whether I should invest in a faster PC in the future to use as a dedicated music server. As this is really just a hobby, I didn’t want to spend a whole lot of money on a music server just for a PC to test software with and this little $22 wonder got me off the ground to test. I did underestimate the ram requirements of the Vortexbox and had to find another 512mb of DDR2 to get the minimum 1GB of RAM required as the Dell only shipped with 512mb  of RAM and I needed 1GB  of RAM  to get this box up and running.</p>

<p><strong>The Beauty of Vortex Box</strong></p>

<p>You do have to be a bit of technical soul to work your way around vortexbox if you need to add more programs and change some settings  and  you may even have to work with a command line, but I found it relatively easy to do and have been able to get the media server online and I can play my music with Itunes with ease, which was the entire point. Once you have the vortexbox set up who cares if you only spent $20?</p>

<p><strong>Set It, and Forget It</strong>   <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/JIM_3338.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-4254" title="Rip a CD with ease" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/JIM_3338-1024x680.jpg" alt="It's easy to RIP a CD with vortexbox" width="600" height="" /></a> Simplicity  is why a Mac Mini is so attractive to me as I want to be able to replace my CD Player – a Rega Planet –   and have all my music in one place.  Once I change a few settings on the Mac Mini I can run the server headless and the Mac Mini is a wife-approved form factor in the living room that’s quiet. <strong>This is an important factor that must not be overlooked</strong>. But the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VSY66O/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001VSY66O">Vortex Box is a cheaper music server by far,</a> and once you get the server software installed on your PC you can run the music server anywhere there’s a network and power as all the management of the vortexbox is run through the easy to use web interface that you can access from any  PC or even a tablet with  a web browser. The best part about a music server is that it’s hidden from view and yet you can still access all your music and  the convenience far outweighs using storing and caring for a CD collection. In the case of the Dell this  was really just to play with rather than really use as a music server but the software did run on this old P4 computer with just 1GB of RAM, but save for the fact that it’s a slow computer to work with, once I had it setup as a music server I noticed no difference between using this computer due to a quad core PC. Thankfully, you really don’t need a lot of processing power to play music. If I tweaked the server, I could have done two things had I really wanted to use this Dell as my one and only music server:</p>

<p>I could have <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/review-western-digital-wd-scorpio-black-750-gb-2-5-inch-mobile-hard-drive/" title="Review: Western Digital WD Scorpio Black 750 GB  2.5-Inch Mobile Hard Drive">bought a bigger hard drive</a> to toss inside the Dell. I would use at least a 1TB drive, perhaps even a 2TB hard drive as the cost for the bigger drive isn’t that much more in price. Or – and this is the cheaper option. I have a 500GB external drive that would be put to use as  as an external source for my music. The hard drive doesn’t have to be inside the PC. You do have to configure the vortexbox installation to use an external drive for storage instead, but it is possible and this would be the cheaper option too as I already have the hard drive and it’s bought and  paid for. The best part of using the vortexbox is that you don’t have to touch the server once you have it configured. You can copy all your music to the external drive and hook it up and you’re done. I found no connection or other issues. The vortexbox served and played my music.</p>

<p><strong>Ease of Use</strong> But if your music is still on CD’s the Dell music server really shines as all you have to do to get the music onto your music server is to open the CD player, toss in a CD and shut the door. The PC does all the rest from getting the cover art to ripping the CD in flac format. When all the songs on the CD have been imported the drawer opens and you remove the CD and install another. Rinse, Lather, Repeat. As a test I tried to rip Van Morrison’s Best Of and the rip went fine but it did take a while – about 15 minutes. I think this speed could be increased with a faster processor. This is an older computer. But, if you’ve got the time, an old PC and enough storage there’s no reason why you couldn’t use your old PC as a music server with this free music server software   <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/JIM_3347.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-4256" title="JIM_3347" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/JIM_3347-1024x680.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="" /></a> **Buy a new vortexbox. ** If the thought of working and waiting for an old PC sends shivers down your spine you can take the easy way out and buy your own brand new vortexbox with a modern processor and the software installed and pre configured already:</p>

<p> </p>

<p>This modern music server uses the exact same software as on my $20 dell, but it’s wrapped in a faster processor and is ready to go out of the box. The cheap Dell does take some tweaking to get going, but once it’s running as you like you really don’t have to touch it I found. <strong>Summary. </strong> For  the money  I spent on the Dell Music Server I’m quite happy. You do have to be a bit more of a propellor  head  and you many even have to dip into the command line  to get things set the way you like but once you do , I  found  the vortexbox to be easy to use as both an iTunes ana DLNA server. <strong>Pros</strong>. cheap cheap cheap. and runs on almost any old PC. <strong>Cons</strong>. Would take some tweaking  to get my entire CD collection on, and at 15 minutes to RIP this might take a while.  Also, the fan is noisy on this PC. You can use it as a server, but not  a player in the same room.  There are other quieter PC’s out there</p>

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>This particular **Mac Pro from Apple **uses 240 pin sdram dimms and you don’t have to worry about  lack of memory slots with this Apple Mac Pro model  as there’s four banks of memory upgrade slots, and each memory bank contains two different memory upgrade slots on each bank, for a total of eight slots you can install memory for this Apple Mac Pro. From the Factory the **Mac Pro Dual Core 2.0 GHz **shipped with just 1GB of memory, which is almost pitiful in these times but you can do much better with the memory upgrades and max this Mac Pro Model out to 32gb of RAM.</p>

<p><strong>Where to Buy Memory for Apple Mac Pro Dual Core 2.0 GHz</strong></p>

<p>First,  I need to  tell you that vendors of memory upgrades for the Mac Pro’s list both memory upgrade kits and memory upgrade modules for the Mac Pro Dual Core 2.0 GHz.   As memory must be installed in matched pairs, or memory upgrade kit with this particular Mac Pro model, some vendors have chosen to sell and market the memory for this Mac Pro model in memory ugrade kits. This allows the customer to buy a matched pair of memory upgrades and know they don’t need anything else.</p>

<p>But, (and there’ always a but..) some vendors have chosen to stick to listing the memory upgrades for this Mac Pro in just single modules and will assume that the customer is wise enough to buy memory in matched pairs. It’s my opinion that this is a mistake as well..why make it harder than it needs to be to buy ram for your Mac Pro?</p>

<p>Anyway, I here are <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/240-pin-ddr2-pc5300-sdram-memory-upgrade-prices/" title="240 Pin DDR2 PC5300 SDRAM Memory Upgrade Prices"> <strong>memory modules for the Mac Pro</strong></a></p>

<p>With this info you can make  an educated decision when buying memory upgrades for your Apple Mac Pro 2.0GHz</p>

<p>here’s not a day goes by where I’m not asked the question:</p>

<p><strong>What kind of RAM do I need? What RAM and Memory Upgrades Should I Buy?</strong></p>

<p><strong style="line-height: 18px;"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I">Apple MacBook Pro. Best Selling NoteBook Today</a></strong></p>

<p><img class="size-full wp-image-1484 alignleft" title="Best Selling Notebook" alt="Best laptop" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Screen-shot-2011-03-26-at-2.24.37-PM.png" width="300" height="242" />Well, that depends. On the PC side of the memory equation you usually have more options and it’s easier to** find out what kind of memory you need for your computer** as the manufacturer and models names for the desktop and notebook computers are distinct for each computer manufacturer and model.</p>

<p>For example, If you  are looking to** upgrade your del<strong>l, and you have a **dell notebook</strong> you need memory upgrades for all you usually have to do is find out what model number that is and you’re usually off to the races. For an example: <strong>You need memory for your brand new Dell inspiron 14  or Inspiron 15 or even inspiron 17 models with core i3 and core i5 processors **that are **current notebook models from Dell</strong>, but would perform much better if you just <strong>added more memory.</strong> (as adding memory to most computers will offer: more ram equals faster software)</p>

<p>Right, so you’ve got the model name from Dell:  So you find any<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com"><strong>memory store</strong> </a>that you choose and each of these stores will offer a <strong>memory configurator **where you just plunk in your manufacturer and model name of your</strong> desktop or notebook <strong>and you’re returned with a list of **memory &amp; ram upgrades</strong> that match your computer.</p>

<p>Sounds Easy, Right? And it is: For this example, I’ll use<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial"><strong>Crucial Technology</strong></a><strong>,</strong> but you could pick from any <strong>vendor of memory</strong> I list on <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="ramseeker memory prices">ramseeker</a> as they all carry easy to use** memory configurators that will help you choose the right memory** and ram upgrades.</p>

<p>But for this example, I’ll use<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial"> Crucial Technology</a>: So I find my manufacturer: Which is in this case, Dell. And then I’ll choose <strong>Inspiron laptops/notebooks,</strong> and then lastly I find my model, for this example I will use Dell Inspiron 15 and I see theres’s two choices: One is just Dell inspiron 15, and the other  is <strong>dell inspiron 1564</strong>, The <strong>dell inspiron 15</strong> seems  to list a  little older types of memory  and I’m going go guess that the** dell inspiron 15 (1564) <strong>is the better choice for me as this model listing at crucial specifies</strong> DDR3 PC1066 memory modules <strong>which is the more recent of the two listings and also a quick reference of the dell website specifies that the **dell inspiron 15  that’s currently offered does require the DD3 PC-8500 memory modules</strong>.</p>

<p>And that’s it.  A bit of research, and I’ve got a <strong>new ram and memory upgrade ordered for my Dell Inspiron 15 notebook</strong> computer.</p>

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>Apple iTunes is in my opinion, the best Apple software for the Mac and the best part is that it’s included in each and every  Mac you buy</p>

<p>But, over the years iTunes has grown in size to the point where it allows you to buy new music, buy  new videos and TV shows and more at the iTunes store. All this takes more and more processing power over time to the point where if you don’t have a relatively new Apple computer you may not be able to run the current Generations of iTunes at all.</p>

<p><strong>Apple iTunes Requirements </strong></p>

<p>For the Mac, you need at least 512 mb of RAM and either a G4, G5 or Intel Mac for the Application to run. If you have the need to play standard definition video, the requirements rise to at least a 1Ghz G4 and still jus 512mb of RAM.</p>

<p>High Definition Video is where the ram and processor requirements for Apple iTunes really dial up: For 720p high definition video the minimum possible is a 2.0 Ghz Intel Core 2 Duo processor, with twice the  amount  of RAM at 1GB. And if you want full 1080p high definition, the bar gets raised higher at 2.4Ghz Intel Core Duo and 2GB of RAM.</p>

<p>So, if  you’re just playing music, it seems you can get away with an <a href="http://www.lowendmac.com">older Mac</a>, but if you want to use HD video you’ll need a newer Mac (<a href="http://www.everymac.com">from about 2008 and up</a>).</p>

<p>Depending on the speed and RAM on your current computer, you might be able to upgrade the RAM or you may have to buy a brand new Mac to get full HD. The Apple Mac Mini is my favorite Mac for iTunes use as it’s small, quiet and one of the <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004YLCLM6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004YLCLM6">cheapest Mac computers you can buy</a></strong>.</p>

<p>I wonder, is this the end of the Apple iMac?  I hope not, as the Apple iMac is one of the best selling desktop computers in the past from Apple, but with the release of the iPad, new MacBook Pro’s rumored to be released soon, and the fact that lightweight ultrabooks and even smartphones are more popular than ever before I wonder how, and more importantly when Apple will release new Apple iMac computers in 2012?</p>

<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3877" title="Cheap iMac 27 inch " src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/imac-27-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></p>

<p>The current<strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/new-2011-apple-imac-models-announced/" title="2011 Apple iMac lineup"> 2011 Apple iMac models</a></strong> saw a release date back in May, meaning as we enter a new year, the once new iMac isn’t so high tech anymore and I am hoping for the 2012 iMac to  be released with the following features:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Touch Screen iMac</strong> . The iPad has touch input, and so does the iPhone, so  why not the 2012 iMac?  I wonder how much  of a feature this would be used on a desktop computer? Would it be beneficial to be able to use a touch screen iMac for the everyman? (and woman). One thing I think that would be beneficial for a touch screen iMac would be for shopping and scrolling, and I bet the graphics community would love to be able to use a finger instead of a mouse.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>More Memory</strong>. The ram on the iMac for 2011 is already at a respectable 16GB, but I predict that by the end of the yea 16GB for iMac willl be the norm, and  32GB would allow for future expandability.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Faster Processors</strong>. The iMac could replace the Mac Pro entirely if the processor speed, ram and hard drive specifications would increase. We haven’t seen a Mac Pro update in ages and in fact, it’s been so long that I wonder is there will be a brand new Mac Pro at all or will Apple rely on the Pro notebook lineup for all their professional customers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Flatter screen.</strong> If Apple can make a notebook that only weighs a few pounds, surely they can make the iMac better looking. It’s still a pretty thin machine, but the current iMac design needs  a refresh.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>**5. Bigger Screen **This is another possibility.  With LED prices continuosly dropping, it would make perfect sense for a 32 inch iMac that doubles as a TV. and offers built in TV capabilities –  something like Google TV where you could  use the iMac as your media center, and not just the hub.</p>

<p><strong>When  will the 2012 Apple iMac Release Date Be?</strong></p>

<p>The  last time we saw a completely new iMac design is last May, and I can’t expect that we will see a new Apple iMac before May 2012. There’s a very good chance for a brand new MacBook Pro  to be released in 2012. Then  there’s the iPad and early spring tends to be the time for iPad releases. The iPhone has historically been released in the summertime and then we’re into the fall for iPod releases or other surprises from Apple for the holiday shopping season. This leaves **May 2012 to be a very good chance to see a new iMac release in 2012 **and would be one year from the release of the 2011 Apple iMac. – a good time to replace the 2011 Apple iMac with a newer 2012 iMac.</p>

<p>Even though the <a href="http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/macbook/stats/macbook-core-2-duo-2.4-white-13-polycarbonate-unibody-mid-2010-specs.html">MacBook has been discontinued</a> for over a few months now, the MacBook tradition still continues in the <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/mn/search/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;scn=2423178011&amp;redirect=true&amp;keywords=macbook&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;qid=1326739548&amp;h=bfe726e6ea500e6c63c360db0a1b7724b3369e52&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;rh=n%3A2423178011%2Ck%3Amacbook#/ref=sr_st?keywords=macbook">MacBook Air and MacBook Pro in 2012</a></strong> and as these notebooks become more and more popular over time, one area I have paid more attention to in recent times is to make sure I  have the most ergonomic and comfortable desktop or workspace I can, and one way to do this is to prop up your MacBook with a MacBook Stand.</p>

<p>There’s two schools of thought when it comes to buying a MacBook stand. One is to get the MacBook out of the way  and use the processor only. Using a mac notebook as a desktop replacement can be not  the most effective method to  use your desktop space and I find that the space behind your MacBook ends up being a no mans land for hard drives and other junk. But, if you buy a MacBook stand, you can prop up your MacBook and connect it to an external mouse and keyboard (USB, or bluetooth) and monitor and  have much more desktop space.</p>

<h2 id="closed-macbook-stand"><strong>Closed MacBook Stand</strong></h2>

<p>The<strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0053XG1AW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0053XG1AW"> Twelve South MacBook Stand </a></strong>is just one example of this:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0053XG1AW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0053XG1AW"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3898" title="best macbook stand" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/macbookstand1.jpg" alt="cheap macbook stand" width="300" height="300" /></a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>This is one of the better looking stands for your MacBook Pro and yet still offers full access to all the external ports you may need to access for monitor, USB, etc.</p>

<p>The downside of this design of stand for MacBook is that although it gets your MacBook Pro out of the way,  you lose the screen real estate of the MacBook Pro. Heck, you may as well buy a Mac Mini and save over a thousand  dollars if this is where your MacBook Pro will reside most of the time.</p>

<p>The advantage of this MacBook stand is obvious from the photo though, as it get your MacBook out of the way and frees up a whole lot of desktop for your monitor, or files an folders or even a coffee.</p>

<p>Another advantage using a MacBook Stand is that whatever style of stand you end up buying, these things prop up your MacBook and reduce the diet coke effect where you spill on your brand new MacBook Pro, which is a very expensive lesson to learn, but with a stand, your fancy Apple notebook is saved from splils.</p>

<h2 id="elevated-macbook-stand"><strong>Elevated MacBook Stand </strong></h2>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0044RUSZM/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0044RUSZM"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3902" title="Elevated MacBook Stand" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/macbookstand2.jpg" alt="Griffin MacBook Stand" width="300" height="300" /></a></strong></p>

<p>This is the cheaper MacBook Stand of the two designs, and the <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0044RUSZM/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0044RUSZM">Griffin Elevated Macook Stand</a></strong>  comes in on sale at about half the price of the twelve south unit above.</p>

<p>The advantage of the elevated design of this stand is that you can still use your monitor if you so choose. You could still use this elevated stand and keep your MacBook closed too if you prefer.</p>

<p>But the whole point of this stand is  to get your MacBook screen at a more elevated angle to reduce neck strain. In most cases, notebook design is lacking  and  will leave the notebook  user looking down on the notebook screen, which over time can become uncomfortable.</p>

<p>The disadvantage of the Griffin stand, and  other elevators is that you are limited to the height of the stand, and whether it’s just personal preference or that you have a taller or shorter desk or seating arrangement, is that despite your best efforts your MacBook just may not be at the level  you desire. if the stand is too low, you can still prop up your MacBook stand with  a few books or something but if the elevated stand is too high, I found the only solution with this type of stand is to remove it all together.</p>

<h2 id="the-best-and-cheapest-macbook-stand"><strong>The Best and Cheapest MacBook Stand </strong></h2>

<p>These are becoming harder and harder to find as the digital age evolves, but I have found  that propping your Macbook up on a phonebook or two is one of the better way to elevate your MacBook to the best  level for your needs  and the best part is that phonebooks are free. If you use phonebooks from different cities, you can tweak your tower or books to get  a custom stand for your MacBook without the added expense of buying a custom MacBook Stand</p>

One of the benefits of Apple computers, is that despite their high price when compared to comparable PC’s from HP or some other manufacturer running windows is that they hold their value and if you shop on eBay or craigslist you may be able to buy a <a href="http://www.lowendmac.com" title="cheap used mac">cheap used Mac</a>.</p>

<p>And  I know, that in my experiences shopping online that most times the seller of  the older Mac just wants to get some money for their old Mac and replace it with a newer model or perhaps they need the cash for something else, and a lot of times they state that there’s warranty on the Apple computer left, <strong>but how do you know for sure</strong>?</p>

<p><strong>Get an Apple Warranty Check</strong></p>

<p>One reason i prefer Apple over other PC brands, is that despite the high price that the  Apple products demand, Apple offers some of the best support in the computer industry and one example is this:</p>

<p>To check if the Apple computer you already own or are considering buying is in warranty  is to<a href="https://selfsolve.apple.com/GetWarranty.do" title="apple warranty service check"> go to Apple and check</a>,</p>

<p>All you need to do this is the serial number of the computer and the country you are in and Apple will return to you a custom report on the status of the Apple computer you are considering buying. When you have this info you will be abl to tell if the seller of your possible Apple purchase is on the up and up, and  even if your possible Mac is  out of warranty, you will be able to see what your options are when it comes to either getting the Mac repaired.</p>

<p>A two second visit to the Apple support page could save you possible problems with your used Mac purchase down the road.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2011/12/i-wish-there-was-iphoto-for-windows/">I Wish There Was iPhoto for Windows</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>Due to the fact that ram prices are not what they once  were I have had to cut costs in 2011. In December 2010 8GB of RAM would cost you just under $100, but now you can buy 8GB of RAM for close to $30.00.  As you can imagine, the profits on $34.00 are much less than a hundred bucks. One reason for this decrease in ram prices over 2011 have been that demand for RAM has been less as most laptops and tablets come from the factory with enough RAM already installled.</p>

<p>What does this have to do with wishing there was iPhoto for Windows 7?  I had to sell my much loved MacBook Pro and buy a much cheaper windows 7 notebook to work on this site as the earnings have dwindled over the years considerably.</p>

<p><strong>Windows Alternatives to iPhoto. </strong></p>

<p>I have only been working on the PC exclusively for a few weeks now, but one piece of software I miss is iPhoto. Even though I have a background in photography, I always loved the ease of use in managing my photos that iPhoto offered. I know, there were other software for Mac I could have used, like lightroom or Aperture, but for just importing my photos, a quick cleanup of sharpness and brightness and then  lately, sharing my photos on facebook.</p>

<p><strong>Help, I’ve got  Windows 7.  </strong></p>

<p>Windows 7 actually does a pretty good job of  importing my pics and gives me quick access and  an easy to browse directory of photos and allows me to flag my keepers – one feature I really miss the most with iPhoto.</p>

<p>So, for now my photos are just in my photograph folder on my PC, but I thinking of either working with social networks for photography – either flickr, or picassa by Google. I have been a flickr user in the past, but as Google continues to grow  I  find I like to  consolidate my work using Google apps such as Google Docs or Google mail, I wonder if using Picassa for Windows might be the best way to keep track of my photos as (like Flikr)  I could work in the cloud with not only my documents but my photos too</p>

<p>This is where I miss using my MacBook Pro the most and that’s using iPhoto  to work with my pictures. I have been a Mac user for so long, that any new software for editing photos on Microsoft Windows 7 feels like  it’s such a learning curve and I just wish that  Apple released  iPhoto for Windows like they do with iTunes for Windows or Safari for Windows.</p>

<p>I’ve never really cared about backgounds for Mac computer much when I was a long time Mac user as my computing style is this: h<strong>ave as many windows open as possible at once so you can’t even see the background</strong>. it helps if you have a lot of ram installed to keep all these windows open.</p>

<p>If I were to change the background  on my Mac it would be to just a simple background like am 18 percent grey. This would allow me to work in Photoshop without  having to worry about the background messing  with me when I was photo editing. I was never a big customizer when it cames to my Mac. I would buy a new Mac notebook every year or so and then get to work.  I wouldn’t  even bother buying Applecare because I have written, it’s just a waste of money. I prefer to self insure my  Apple computers after the first year.</p>

<p><strong>Mac Backgrounds That Look Great  </strong></p>

<p>There’s lots of  great looking free backgrounds ready for download though, or you could even stick with the stock one from Lion, Apple’s latest operating system. In recent years this is all I  have done. But this is just one guy’s opinion when it comes to personalizing your Mac and I’m not the be all and end all when it comes to customizing your Mac to your specific taste. Here’s a few of the better places to start  looking for Mac backgrounds that look great.</p>

<p>Mac AppStorm shows us <a href="http://mac.appstorm.net/roundups/graphics-roundups/50-mac-desktops-for-maximum-visual-goodness/">50 Mac Desktops for Maximum Visual Goodness</a> and according to them it can be a ‘fantastica motivator’.</p>

<p>If the 50 weren’t good enough for you they also offer <a href="http://mac.appstorm.net/roundups/graphics-roundups/160-original-awesome-mac-desktop-wallpapers/">another 160</a> great looking Mac backgrounds for you to peruse. That should keep you busy for a while. <img src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p>Apple Wallpapers offers, well.. <a href="http://applewallpapers.net/">Apple Wallpapers</a></p>

<p>Desktop Nexus will reinvent  your desktop with <a href="http://www.desktopnexus.com/tag/mac/">these backgrounds for the Mac</a>.</p>

<p>These are just a few of the best places to start your search for   Mac backgrounds available for download today. (free, in most cases too)</p>

    <h1><a href="/2011/12/windows-notepad-mac-software-alternatives/">Windows NotePad. Mac Software Alternatives</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>I’m switching from Mac to PC.  I know that the usual consensus in the online community, especially in  the blogger community is to switch from PC to Mac and not the other way around,  but when I went shopping for a brand new notebook this fall I really couldn’t justify the cost of a brand new MacBook computer of any shape or size when you can buy a comparable <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/mn/search/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;keywords=windows%207%20notebook&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;bbn=565108&amp;qid=1325627649&amp;rnid=562215011&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;rh=n%3A172282%2Cn%3A%21493964%2Cn%3A541966%2Cn%3A565108%2Ck%3Awindows%207%20notebook%2Cp_n_operating_system_browse-bin%3A2287320011">Windows 7 notebook</a></strong> for considerably  less money.</p>

<p>I find that the work (and increasingly, my play time too)  I do with my computer is done in the cloud. I write in the cloud, check email in the cloud but there’s one area that I still use an application for and that’s a simple text editor. I don’t have a need for anything complicated and even Microsoft Office is too much.</p>

<p>On the PC the choice is notepad and it suits me just fine for simple text stuff. But what is the alternative text editor on the Mac?</p>

<p><strong>Mac NotePad Alternatives</strong></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2523">TextEdit </a></strong>is the default text editor on the Mac, but when you compare it to** <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notepad_(software)">Windows notepad</a>** it seems like it’s a bit of a letdown and really really simple. Almost too simple.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://docs.google.com">Google Docs</a></strong> is a free text editor that’s worth a look – and I can recommend  that as well. Not only can you edit text, but you have a full office suite with Google docs too. And the best part – it’s all free.</p>

<p>One thing I do miss the most about text editing software for the Mac is <strong><a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/bbedit10.html">BBEdit</a></strong>. This software is one of the more robust text editors out there for the Mac and if you do any sort of programming, web or otherwise  – this software is definitely worth a look.</p>

<p>If free text editing software is what you need, the good folks at Barebones software – the same people that are the creators of  BBEdit also offer Text Wrangler,  and this free text editing  software far surpasses any text editor for Mac or PC.</p>

<p>If you need a cloud based text editor that allows you to edit your files no matter where you are – Google Docs is the clear winner. But, if you prefer an Apple Application, <strong><a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/">TextWrangler </a></strong>is the best free text editing software for the Mac today.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2011/12/where-to-find-quicktime-download-software/">Where To Find QuickTime Download Software</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>One of the many issues I tend to have recently is that  in my move from Mac  to PC  – I know, I know –  but I just can’t find the money right now for a new 2012 MacBook Pro. RAM prices are not what they once were and in tough times, one has to cut costs. One way to do this is to buy a PC notebook instead of the Macs I am used  to as this switch to the dark side is much cheaper than buying a new Mac today.</p>

<p>Anyway, one are where the <strong>Mac just works,</strong> is with QuickTime software. When I would work on my Mac,  all I had to do would be to would  be to – just use my Mac, whereas the PC makes me stop and  think. Earlier today I had to stop what I was doing as QuickTime is not on my PC installed from the factory. This leaves me to have to stop and think** where can I find a QuickTime download**?</p>

<p>It  took me time to figure out if I really needed to install QuickTime, but then I figured I will need to download Quicktime eventually so I may as well do it while I am with an internet connection.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/"><strong>Download QuickTime 7</strong></a></p>

<p>The download page directed me to the PC version, as I’m writing this on a PC and  at the  time of writing , version 7.7.1 is current for Windows XP, Windows Vista or Windows 7 users.</p>

<p>Apple does require my email address,  and I think that’s a fair trade – I’m a registered Apple user already so they have my information anyway.  I’m essentially just repeating myself here. I figure an email address for free software is a fair trade.</p>

<p>My QuickTime Download experience went smoothly and installed on my windows 7 machine and now I can  use any software that requires the use of QuickTime software for PC.</p>

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Screen-Shot-2011-12-06-at-1.41.25-PM.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-3603 alignleft" title="15 inch MacBook Pro Deal" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Screen-Shot-2011-12-06-at-1.41.25-PM.png" alt="Apple MacBook Pro Deal" width="298" height="293" /></a></p>

<p>I keep on seeing ads for this software everywhere  I turn, so I guess it’s about time I had a closer look to see what all the fuss is about. <strong><a href="http://mackeeper.zeobit.com/">MacKeeper</a></strong>, as they call it – is 911 for you Mac, and the main features of this software for Apple computers –  both desktop and  notebooks –  is to keep your Mac running healthy and happy.</p>

<p><strong>Antivirus and Anti Theft Protection</strong></p>

<p>I’ve been running without antivirus protection on all my Apple computers for years, but they do happen and MacKeeper tends to be  offer protection against all security threats – not just viruses, but also identity theft, phishing attacks, unsafe downloads, email viruses and Mac Spyware and Mac malware is also blocked with MacKeeper.</p>

<p>The anti-theft feature won’t stop somebody from stealing your Mac, but it can help you identify the thief by reporting on the location of your stolen Mac and  even taking a picture of the thief by using the built in web camera.</p>

<p><strong>Robust Data Control</strong></p>

<p>Your data is probably the most important thing to you and usually has much more value than even the computer itself, and MacKeeper offer four components to keep your data safe:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The data encrypter hides your important files and those wishing to view those files need a password to do so.</li>
  <li>Backups are so important. Your <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/how-to-contact-western-digital-support/" title="How To Contact Western Digital Support">hard drive could fail at any time</a> and you’d be left without a thing when your hard drive crashes. Don’t let this happen to you and use the MacKeeper backup component to make copies of your stuff on external hard drives, via FTP , USB drive or ZeoDisk.</li>
  <li> File recovery lets you preview and recover deleted files. I know I have been trigger happy at times with the trash and would love to have had this tool in my arsenal.</li>
  <li>The shredder deletes files and folders you no longer need forever.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Cleaning and Maintenance </strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Duplicates Finder removes, wait for it  – duplicate files. It costs money and space to keep two or more of every file.</li>
  <li>Fast Clean removes all the junk  on your Mac that accumulates over time</li>
  <li>Smart Installer is a much better method to remove applications on your Ma ensuring there’s no files and clutter and hidden files left behind.</li>
  <li>File finder allows you to quickly find the file you’re looking for with ease.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Optimization</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Updates happen automatically with the included Update Tracker software. Each version of software on your Mac is checked to be sure you are running the latest software.</li>
  <li>Login Items allow you to start some applications automatically which results in more time for you and less time  waiting for applications to load.</li>
  <li>Default Apps is a great way to choose an application to open a file with.</li>
</ol>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  <strong>Summary</strong>
</div>

<div>
  There&#8217;s  a grand total of sixteen different Mac Apps in the MacKeeper  suite designed to keep your Mac secure from threats and running smoothly, and with a price of just$38.00 for a limited time that includes a license  for 1 Mac, that works out to just pennies a day to keep your Mac safe and sound. If you have up to 2 macs, the price goes up to $58.95, and adding  third Mac gets you to $88.95.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  A free trial download of MacKeeper is available so you can fully test MacKeeper free of charge before you buy the software, and if you  do decide to buy MacKeeper you can get it activated instantly online  &#8211; you don&#8217;t  have to wait for the software to ship to you as you already have the software and are just unlocking MacKeeper to continue use past the 14 day trial period.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  For$38.00, this looks like a fair price to pay for a full featured utility for use with any Mac computer on sale today.

I know, I know – how could I after all these years of tracking memory prices primarily for Apple computers? Well, this is probably an article for another day but I find that  the value offered by a Mac for my needs is no longer there. I’m typing this on a <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Screen-Shot-2011-12-21-at-3.29.06-PM.png">very well equipped cheap PC notebook</a></strong> and if it were not for a few minor things that I miss I would be hard pressed to tell the difference as I switched from Mac to PC notebook and saved $1600 along the way.</p>

<p>That said, one thing I really miss and it’s probably due to the fact I have worked with Apple computers for close to two decades now is how easy it was to print screen on a Mac:** Shift – Command – 3** and I would be done.  I used the print selection feature even more: <strong>Shift Command 4 would get me just a selection of a page. </strong></p>

<p>Both of these simple commands would  save a screen shot to my desktop and I would then double click on the screen shot to print the image – in most cases by using the preview application.</p>

<p><strong>Print Screen on Windows Instead</strong></p>

<p>I have no idea how to do the same on a PC as easy – especially when it  comes to making a selection of the screen. I miss command shift 4 every day since switching from Mac to PC, and it may be one reason to switch back to the Mac OS at some point, but at the moment this cheap Acer notebook  is going to have to do the  trick for now. I know I can use the ‘snipping tool’ in Windows 7 to make either a selection or screen grab of the entire screen, but this is far from perfect: you have to open up an entire other windows application to do so and then navigate menus to get the screen grab you want.</p>

<p>This is one example of how the <strong>Mac offers a far superior print screen solution</strong> than the more popular PC.</p>

<p>This isn’t something that the hard drive manufacturers like to talk about, but it really is common sense: Most hard drives in use today use moving parts and after a while, those parts stop moving due to use.  Hard Drives are sensitive electronics that don’t like to be jolted or moved, and despite the advances in solid state hard drives or even the technology in keeping standard old school hard drives free of damaging shock there may be a time when you need help with your hard drive</p>

<p><strong>Western Digital Hard Drive Help</strong></p>

<p>There’s more than one manufacturer of hard drives and names like Seagate, Buffalo and even memory manufacturers are now getting into the game when it  comes to solid state drives, but Western Digital might very well be the best selling hard drive manufacturer in 2012 and beyond.</p>

<p>I have been lucky to not experience a hard drive failure in recent  times, so I haven’t had to call or email Western Digital for support. I did have to contact LaCie once but that was due to the fact that I lost the cables associated with the drive in a move and had to order new cables for once was at a time a very large hard dive at 1TB.</p>

<p>But if you haven’t been so lucky and need help with your hard drive from Western Digital, you’re usually in luck as most hard drive failures tend to happen in the first few months if they’re going to fail and this will happen  well into the two year limited warranty that comes with each Western Digital Hard Drive.</p>

<p>To contact Western Digital your best bet is to visit the <a href="http://support.wdc.com/">western digital support page</a> where you can find answers to your hard drive support questions including dowloads, registration, warranty services, installation help as well as phone and email support too.</p>

<p>I hope you’ve been lucky as I have when it comes to hard drive failure, but if you do need help with your WD hard drive, the folks at Western Digital are happy to help</p>

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>There’s two things I love about the internet:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>You can connect and interact with just about anybody and read and learn so much from each other.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You can shop online!</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>I have been shopping for notebook computer memory for close to 15 years now to help you guys get the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="best deal on ram">best deal on RAM</a>, and buy it much cheaper than from other over priced stores. (see the sidebar to the right of this article for some real cheap ram).</p>

<p>And one of the cheapest computers on sale right now tend to be from <a href="http://www.acer.com">Acer computer</a>. Add some memory to these cheapo notebooks and you’ve got a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/mn/search/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;scn=565108&amp;keywords=acer%20computer&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;qid=1325625023&amp;h=1bfcd6c6c93e9d31134cb3f88362b6f78c3f5b93&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;rh=n%3A565108%2Ck%3Aacer%20computer">fast and cheap notebook computer for under $600</a>.</p>

<p>Most all Acer notebooks come with a limited warranty, but usually once you’ve made your purchase the online store from which you bought your Acer won’t refund  your money and  this leaves you to have to contact Acer support in the rare case you do have a problem with your new Acer notebook.</p>

<p><strong>Acer  Contact Information</strong></p>

<p>To save you some time, here are the Acer Computer contact information:</p>

<p><a href="http://us.acer.com/ac/en/US/content/home">Acer USA</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.acer.ca/ac/en/CA/content/home">Acer Canada</a></p>

<p><a href="http://br.acer.com/ac/pt/BR/content/home">Acer Brasil </a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.acer.com.mx/ac/es/MX/content/home">Acer Mexico</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.acla.acer.com/ac/es/AR/content/home">Acer Latin America</a></p>

<p>There are also contact support for <a href="http://www.acer.com/worldwide/selection.htmlAc">Acer Europe and Acer Middle East and Asia Pacific </a>too, but the Americas tend to be the most popular when it comes to Acer users so I’ll stop the list there.</p>

<p>Once you find the region you are in you will be able to contact Acer  by phone or email and have any warranty issues you need to be taken care of. I have found that in the past most companies are willing to work with you when it comes to notebook warranty if you treat them like you would like to be treated</p>

<p>As a new Acer notebook PC  user, I hope to never have to use these contact numbers for my Acer notebook but it’s good to know that Acer support will help me in the rare instance I do have  a problem with my Acer notebook computer.</p>

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3124" title="Cheapest Apple  Memory Upgrades" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Screen-Shot-2011-10-08-at-1.48.34-PM.png" alt="Best Prices on Mac RAM" width="311" height="321" /></a>First, I need to determine what you need to buy before I can help further. “Memory Sticks” could be considered RAM memory modules, or they also could be understood as USB drives  or sometimes known as flash sticks too.</p>

<p><strong>Cheap Memory From Amazon</strong></p>

<p>In this case, I am going to assume you need to buy cheap memory modules. There are many memory stores willing to help you with getting the right ram for your desktop or notebook computer, but I am finding of late that when shopping for RAM, one of the best places to buy memory upgrades or menory sticks, if you prefer – is from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">Amazon</a>.</p>

<p>Over the years, Amazon has grown from selling  not only books but also computers and computer memory too and often times the ram you buy at Amazon is cheaper than even if you were to buy it  from the memory anufacturer directly.</p>

<p>An example, would be 8GB RAM for notebook computers –  one of the best selling memory upgrades in 2012 thanks to the fact that most 2012 notebooks on sale come from the factory direct with 4GB of DDR3 ram, so to double the ram in your notebook computer, you will need to add another 4GB of RAM by buying two memory modules. Due to size and space limitations most notebooks come with just  two ram upgrade slots to install the RAM into, which leaves you to replace the RAM you already have installed with larger memory modules and this is in the form of an<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002YUF8ZG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399349&amp;creativeASIN=B002YUF8ZG"> 8GB DDR3 memory upgrade KIT.</a></p>

<p>If you compare the prices on DDR3 memory sticks, you will see that in most instances, it’s hard to beat the lowest price on RAM from Amazon:</p>

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p><strong>Update: Yes</strong></p>

<p>Now that 2012 versions of the Mac Mini, iMac and MacBook Pro have been released you can use DDR3 1600MHz memory upgrades. In fact, here’s the best prices:</p>

<p>[table id=15 /]</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Screen-Shot-2011-12-06-at-1.41.25-PM.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3603" title="15 inch MacBook Pro Deal" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Screen-Shot-2011-12-06-at-1.41.25-PM.png" alt="Apple MacBook Pro Deal" width="298" height="293" /></a>Not Yet.</p>

<p>At present, all currently shipping Apple computers use DDR3 1333MHz as the fastest ram available for Apple computers. In the upcoming months, this may change  as new Apple computers are released in 2012, but for the time being we’re stuck with 1333Mhz  as the fastest RAM you can install in any Apple computer model</p>

<p>MacBook Pro models use DDR3 sodimms with a maximum of either 8GB or 16GB of RAM, depending on who you ask. Officially, all the MacBook Pros max out at 8GB of DDR3  1333 Mhz memory, but since released in Feb 2011, 8GB DDR3 memory modules have become available for sale and with the  price  dropping, 16GB of RAM for MacBook Pro is starting to become affordable.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>iMacs can accept more ram than the MacBook Pros thanks to more real estate to work with, as four memory upgrade slots are available for upgrades. Like the MBP’s the iMacs officially max out at 16GB but some have reported on 32GB of iMac memory working just fine.</p>

<p>The Mac Mini is the smallest and cheapest Apple computer on sale today, but the same rules apply to the Mac Mini as it does with the MacBook Pro – 8GB max, so say the folks at Apple. One thing to note is that if you can swap out ram between the iMac/Mac Mini/MacBook Pros as they all use the exact same memory upgrade in a 1333Mhz DDR3 sodimm format.</p>

<p>Even the Apple Mac Pro is still limited to 1333Mhz RAM upgrades and like the other model above – you can have a maximum ram for Mac Pro of either 32GB or 64GB. The Mac Pro  is getting a bit old in 2012 so it’s not too surprising that 8GB DDR3 sodimms were not available on sale, resulting in a maximum of 32GB (4GB x 8 slots)</p>

<p>I have no doubt that in time we will see DDR3 1600 memory requirements for Apple computers, but for 2011 and into 2012 you are limited to using DDR3 10600 memory upgrades for Apple computers</p>

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>After all the feedback recently after verizon decided to charge their customers to pay their bills ( and then rescinded after all the feedback was rightfully negative for this idea) I realized that I had no idea on how to pay my verizon bill and not get charged a fee for giving Verizon my hard earned money and with this, it all changes as if there’s on priority I wan to make it’s better money management.</p>

<h2 id="verizon-bill-payment-options">Verizon Bill Payment Options</h2>

<p>In the interest of full disclosure, my soon to be wife takes care of all the Verizon bill payments in our family, and I am pretty sure she sends payment  via <a href="http://myverizon.com/billpay">bill payment online</a>, but there are other options to make sure  your Verizon bill is paid on time and without penalty.</p>

<p><a href="http://myverizon.com/billview"><strong>View Your Verizon Bill Online</strong></a></p>

<p>One of the first things you are going  to need to do if you want to pay your Verizon bill – regardless of how you end up paying it is to be able to view your  bill online. I am only  a Verizon wireless customer so far, but I know I can not only view my bill with verizon anytime, but at the end of the month I get a paper bill that’s sometimes many many pages long in the mail.</p>

<p><strong>Pay Your Verizon Bill Online</strong></p>

<p>Paying your Verizon Bill online is probably one of the easiest when it comes to methods to get your Verizon account  taken care of . All you have to do is Sign in at My Verizon and click on Account and then Payment and Payment Options to pay Verizon Online</p>

<p><strong>Paying your Verizon Bill By Mail</strong></p>

<p>Verizon will accept your bill payment via check. All you do is send your  payment to Verizon at the address on your Verizon bill. Be sure to include a stamp and send the correct amount so you don’t get charged late payment fees.</p>

<p><strong>Pay Verizon in Person</strong></p>

<p>You can also visit one of many many Verizon outlets and make a payment in person with cash, credit or debit card. All of these methods are acceptable to Verizon.</p>

<p>As you can see, there all lots of ways to get your Verizon Bill paid in time so you continue to use their services and your Verizon account will remain in good standing.</p>

<p>I have yet to succumb to the siren call that is the Apple iPad as frankly,  I don’t know I would have as much use for it. I find that my fancy new Verizon phone pretty much does all an iPad  would and yet is still small enough to fit  in my pocket.</p>

<p>But, I’m getting close to pull the trigger on some sort of tablet, and preferably an iPad  due to the tight integration of other Apple products I already own, so now that I am in the market for a tablet of some kind, where do I find a good deal on an Apple iPad in Canada?</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.apple.ca">Apple Canada</a> iPad Deals </strong></p>

<p>You won’t find much in the way of deals on an iPad here, but  you can get your iPad engraved  – something you cannot do at any other computer store that I am aware of in Canada. There’s also the satisfaction of knowing you bought your iPad directly from Apple instead of some third party.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.futureshop.ca">Future Shop </a>iPad Deals</strong></p>

<p>The iPad is rarely on sale here, but I have seen the odd  sale on iPads here – especially when new Apple iPads are released. A good time to buy an iPad 2 is when the upcoming and rumored Apple iPad 3 is released.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.bestbuy.ca">Best Buy</a></strong> iPad Deals</p>

<p>Like Future Shop,  it’s not very often to see a deal on a brand new iPad from this store either.</p>

<p>The best way to get an iPad Deal might be to either import an iPad from the USA, but then you have the hassle of customs brokerage and assosciated fees, so please do your homework on how much money you will really save if you buy your iPad from the USA.</p>

<p>One last suggestion: If you’re patient you may be able to get a good deal on a iPad at craigslist if you feel you can trust the vendor. The iPad is an expensive electronic  device that’s portable and can be dropped so be sure to do your due diligence on buying a used iPad from an unknown  source.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2011/11/what-is-the-verizon-customer-service-number/">What is the Verizon Customer Service Number?</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>I am moving to the USA soon and in preparation for this we (my fiance and  I) have started  to consider a Verizon family plan, as this plan will allow me to use my Verizon phone in Canada as long as I stay away from data usage, as the costs for using data with Verizon in Canada is one cost I prefer not to have.</p>

<p>She orders the phones, and what should have been a simple transaction  – we buy the verizon phones, and she may have to call Verizon  to get her old Verizon phone number and all I would have to do would be to actiivate my phone, and then have her bring it to me in Canada.</p>

<p>But, Verizon  screwed  this up big time. Apparently it was our fault too, but she just ordered the phone, plan and then thought all would be good. Nope.</p>

<p>She had to call Verizon to get this all straightened out but the first question we had to answer was whom to call at Verizon?</p>

<p><strong>Verizon Contact and Customer Service Numbers</strong></p>

<p>There a lot of ways to<a href="http://www.verizonwireless.com/b2c/contact/index.jsp"> Contact Verizon</a>, email – self serve options, faqs so you don’t even have to call them at all and  you can resolve your own issues, but in our case we had to** Call Verizon at (800) 922-0204** and even though we had to jump through some hoops to make it all work, we did.</p>

<p>We had to get transferred at Verizon customer support to speak to a more advanced customer service than the poor souls on the front line but we did get it all worked out, but it was a comedy of errors. The phones she ordered arrived, but in the meantime we found that we had to ship one back for her to keep her old phone number with Verizon.</p>

<p>Then, as these were newer and popular phones at the time her replacement phone was backordered so we had  to wait. Later when her phone finally did show up, so did another as somehow Verizon managed to ship her two phones – one to her work and one to her home address and after we finally got that sorted out then we were finally able to stop having to contact Verizon to fix our mess and thankfully we have not had to contact Verizon since.</p>

		<div class="post-content"><p>The <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/mn/search/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;x=0&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;y=0&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;field-keywords=ipod&amp;url=search-alias%3Daps">Apple iPod</a></strong> has been around for a while now and with that are different versions. Truth be told, I have an old school 30GB iPod that holds more than enough music I care to listen  to, but it’s starting to get older and I am hoping to buy a new iPod – from Amazon probably as I find that they usually have the<strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/mn/search/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;x=0&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;y=0&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;field-keywords=ipod&amp;url=search-alias%3Daps"> best iPod prices</a></strong>, when you compare iPod prices from them as opposed to buying an iPod direct from Apple.</p>

<p>And this means I will want to get rid of my <a href="http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/ipod/specs/ipod-5th-generation-enhanced-specs.html">old iPod</a> to help pay for the newer model. I am thinking about buying an Apple iPod Touch to replace my much older 30GB model, and I want to be able to reset the 30GB iPod to the same as it was when you bought it back in 2006, almost six years old  now. Wow.</p>

<p>I found an <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1320">Apple help document</a>  that shows me how to reset my 30GB iPod but  also for others too, so I thought I would share this, as I thought surely there’s somebody else wanting to set their iPod to factory settings.</p>

<p>In my case, all I needed to do was was toggle the hold switch, which means  turning the hold switch on and off and then at the same time I held down the menu button and the center button and in about 7 seconds the iPod reset itself. Apple suggests doing all this with your iPod either plugged into a computer or wall outlet, so I made sure it had power before I went ahead with my iPod reset.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2011/11/how-to-force-quit-mac-applications-that-dont-respond/">How To Force Quit Mac Applications That Don&#8217;t Respond</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>As great as Apple Computer is, there are times when either the Mac OS operating system or the application itself doesn’t work as it should resulting in you having to stop what you’re doing  and deal with this troublesome application that doesn’t want to play nice with your Mac.</p>

<p><strong>How To Force Quit Mac Software. </strong></p>

<p>One of the most common indicators that something is wrong with your Apple is  when you’re left sitting there waiting for your software to respond, and then after a while you realize that even on the slowest Apple computer made today – something is wrong with your Mac.</p>

<p>Sometimes,  the Mac will display the indicator or spinwheel displaying that it’s trying to catch up, but don’t be fooled – that appllication is stuck, even if the wheel is spinning your Mac gave up the ghost long ago.</p>

<p>When you’re ready to force quit Mac software, all you have to do is:</p>

<p>From the Apple Menu in the top left hand corner of your screen** choose the force quit menu item. <strong>Alternately, you can use the keyboard and  hi</strong>t Command – Option – Escape** to exit the Mac Application too. Lastly, the third way to force quit is to right click on the Application icon in the dock and  choose force quit. All three get you to the same result:quitting  the Mac software.</p>

<p>I suggest two things to make sure you see less chances of even needing to force quit  Apple software: The first, is to be sure you have enough ram installed. ram is cheap and one reason your application keeps hanging is that you don’t have enough ram to run the software for your Mac in the first  place.</p>

<p>My last suggestion is to restart your Mac.This is an optional step and not  required, but I have found more times than not that a good reboot fixes a lot of computer problems.</p>

<p>If you find yourself needing to force quite your Mac a lot, you may want to take your Mac into see an Apple Genius, or contact Apple Support to be sure there’s not  a problem with your Mac that a force quit will not fix.</p>

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>Maybe it’s the old guy in me, and even though I have been working in online sales for over a decade I never really ordered that much stuff online and would prefer to go to the store in person to check stuff out and decide whether I ant to spend  my money on a product or service.</p>

<p>There’s lots of reasons why I prefer to shop in person, but one of the best reasons is you can sometimes get a better deal if you shop at the store as opposed to shopping online. I have found more deals by physically  being in the right place at the right time.</p>

<p>This old school style of shopping especially holds true to cellular phones too. Usually they are staffed by eager kids who can work the phones with one hand  in seconds, as opposed to my old  fingers trying to figure out how to transfer my contacts from my memory card or some other problem.</p>

<p>And speaking of problems, one problem you have to solve first is the fact that you need to know where to go. When shopping online, you either do a google search for what you want to buy, or a good  place to check is also from Amazon, as – and  this especially holds true in the  USA – chances are they will have i – <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">in stock and on sale</a></strong>.</p>

<p>When it comes to finding Verizon stores in my area, I have found it easiest  to ask the<a href="http://www.verizonwireless.com">** mother ship** </a>rather than do a google  search and  weed through the sites that can’t help you.</p>

<p>Verizon offers a handy dandy <a href="http://www.verizonwireless.com/b2c/storelocator/index.jsp" title="Verizon store locator">Verizon Store Locator</a> where all you have to do is enter either your  zip code, or start your search for the best Verizon location for you by choosing your state and then after you do that you pick your city. You will be presented with  a list of  the closes verizon stores and you get to choose the radius of your search  from 5 miles, 15 miles, 25miles, or 75miles, depending on how far you want to travel.</p>

<p>This is the easiest way to find the best and  Nearest Verizon Locations so that you can go in person for either Verizon sales or support.</p>

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>I’m about to get married in the new year, and move to the USA from Canada, and if there’s one area I have no idea when it  comes to living in the USA , it’s about insurance or banking and I find that the best way I learn is to write as I go so here I am today – exploring the Zander  Insurance Group.</p>

<p><strong>Dave Ramsey Endorsed</strong></p>

<p>The very first thing I noticed when visiting Zander  is that Dave Ramsey  is all over this site, so either this is his own company or just one he endorses, there’s a lot of  goodwill from Dave (<a href="http://www.zanderins.com/about/about.aspx">further reading </a>shows that Dave just endorses the company and  that this insurance company has been around some time – since the 1920’s)</p>

<p><strong>Zander Term Life Insurance. </strong></p>

<p>Zander claims to have 80 years experience with Term Life Insurance, and they recognize how important Term Life Insurance is to a family’s future. You can get an  instant quote for Zander Term Inssurance and find out how cheap Term Life Insurance can be.</p>

<p><strong>Zander Disability Insurance</strong></p>

<p>Health is so important. It beats fancy cars,  iPads, the latest cell phones or even memory upgrades. If you’re not happy and healthy than it doesn’t matter how rich you are and with Zander Disability Insurance you can get covered in the case that you do become ill? I know this will be something I will look into further as I am not getting any younger, and although my job of sitting at the computer is hardly taxing  (boring sometimes) I could get hurt – either on the job or at home and I should  be sure I am covered in case that happens.</p>

<p><strong>Zander Identity Theft Insurance</strong></p>

<p>To be honest, I don’t really think too much about Identity theft, I mean am not a celebrity by any means,  and there’s lots of other Identities I could think of swiping other than my own, But, this is another type of insurance  I should  consider  too, as I am sure it’s the  world’s biggest pain  to get your identity back and Zander would keep  me insured from this event happening</p>

<p><strong>Zander Auto Insurance</strong></p>

<p>I don’t have a car to drive right now, but as I will be moving from the big city to the suburbs, I may need a car in the near future and it looks like Zander insurance may just be what I am looking for when it comes to car  insurance. Sure, there are much bigger car insurance companies out  there, but I can get a free quote on Car insurance quickly and easily using their online insurance quote form.</p>

<p>Financial Guru Dave Ramsey endorses this insurance company fully, so it will definitely be on my shortlist when it comes time to start insurance shopping in the USA.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2011/11/kingston-memory-vs-crucial-memory-which-memory-brand-is-best/">Kingston Memory vs Crucial Memory: Which Memory Brand is Best?</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>When I started ramseeker, the computer ram I compared the most was generic  memory and not RAM from brand name memory  like <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">Crucial</a> or <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/kingston">Kingston Memory</a>  as ram for both desktop and notebook computers was so expensive that it made no sense to install brand name memory in your PC or Mac when the generic memory would work just  as well.</p>

<div style="float: right; margin-right: 5px;">
</div>

<p><strong> Then, RAM Prices Dropped</strong></p>

<p>And all of sudden you could consider buying brand name ram from manaufacturers that no only sell the memory but make it too. I like to think that even though all the memory stores on ramseeker are on the up and up, buying name brand ram for you  computer just feels, well a little more secure.</p>

<p>It used to be that the brand name memory from Crucial was very expensive – in part due to the fact that they advertised heavily to create a brand. Crucial has only been around since the early 90’s. Compared to other industries, the RAM business is quite young.</p>

<p>Both of the memory brands –  Kingston or Crucial offer something generic sellers really can’t compete with and that’s customer support and warranty. Because these two brands make their own memory upgrades it’s easier for them to support the memory in the rare case of a problem with the RAM upgrade.</p>

<p>Asking which memory brand is better is kind of like asking the chicken or egg question. There’s no right answer. This i  ford versus chevy, or republican vs democrat – you’ll tend to favor one brand over the other. I have found that Crucial memory to be a little easier to buy online than Kingston but this is changing too as both Kingston Memory and Crucial Memory are on sale and a fraction of the price they were just one year ago.</p>

<p><strong>One More Brand</strong></p>

<p>Another memory brand you should consider when you’re ready to buy memory is <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/corsair">Corsair</a> memory. These folks used to charge an arm and a leg for RAM, but now tend to be one of the <strong>cheaper memory brands you can buy today</strong>.</p>

<p>I’ve lost my way in the past few years when it comes to what is the best home theater receiver from Denon. I used to be really into HT in the early 2000’s but in the past few years I have been disinterested in what is available for A/V receivers and have been quite  happy with my<a href="http://usa.yamaha.com/en/products/audio-visual/hifi-components/stereo-receivers/rx-v2400_black__u/?mode=model"> Yamaha RXV-2400 </a> for my home theater processing, but now I have the chance to create a brand new home theater from scratch as I have an unfinished basement and I would like to start researching new gear for my new home theater in 2012 and one brand I have always admired is Denon for home theater.</p>

<p><strong>Ten Best Denon Home Theater Receivers for 2012. </strong></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001NNUBNY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001NNUBNY">Denon AVR 5308i(A)</a></strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001NNUBNY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001NNUBNY"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3955" title="denon5308 on sale" alt="Best price on Denon 5308" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/denon5308.jpg" width="300" height="300" /></a></p>

<p>This is the flagship home theater receiver from Denon, and at $5499.00 this is one expensive receiver for those that demand the very best for home audio and video processing. The full feature set on this big receiver is too much to list, but as you can imagine this is one big honking machine that offers all modern home audio features such as 9.3 channels of amplification at 1050 watts in total, 4 source and zone selection and network wifi and streaming on this big brute of an amp.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002PHM9JQ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002PHM9JQ"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3960" title="denon 4810 deal" alt="best price on Denon 4810" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/denon4810.jpg" width="300" height="300" /></a></p>

<p>Want to save over $2000 on a modern home theater a/v receiver? Buy this model instead of the 5308 from Denon . The 4810  is on sale  too at Amazon where you can knock off another $500, bringing the b<strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002PHM9JQ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002PHM9JQ">est price for the Denon AVR4810</a></strong> down to about $2500. This is still a bit much for me to pay for a home theater amp, but you could buy two of these on sale for  the same price of one Denon 53083.</p>

<p>And this is no slouch either: This too offers 9.3 channels that include wifi and home networking features for whole home audio.</p>

<p>Each channel offers 140 watts of amplification and the monoblock design offers high end fidelity not just as a HT amplifier but for two channel listening too.</p>

<p>Of course, all the modern Dolby processing features are included  including Dolby True HD and Dolby Pro Logic IIz for more channels of amplification with the addition of height channels to immerse yourself in full home theater nirvana.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0042KVX2S/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0042KVX2S"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3962" title="denon 4311 deal" alt="cheap denon 4311" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/denon4311.jpg" width="300" height="300" /></a></p>

<p>One of  the very first things I noticed when I started to compare the Denon 4311 against the Denon 4810 and Denon even the Denon 5308, is that with this cheaper denon reciever when compared against the high end denon receivers is that you lose a  subwooffer channel with this model. While the others offer 9.3, this Denon stops at 9.2.</p>

<p>But with a suggested price of over $2000, and a **<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0042KVX2S/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0042KVX2S">street price much cheaper</a>, **the 4311 is one of the newest higher end home theater receivers to be released to date  so far.</p>

<p>The 140 watts of power is the same as the 4810 offers, and the easy setup features and the  two remote controls make this the first real world receiver I could afford.  The others, while nice, would cost me as much as my entire home theater renovation would cost. I may be able to stretch my budget for the 4810, but with this being the Newer Denon receiver, it may be better if I buy this one, as it offers HDMI 1.4a, Automatic room correction for the best sound possible, and the discrete power section means there’s plenty of ooomph for my needs.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004Z50L6E/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004Z50L6E"><strong>Denon AVR 3312CI</strong></a></p>

For about $1000, you get a pretty good receiver with 7 channels of discrete power at 125 watts each, and all the modern technical stuff too.</p>

<p>As the photo shows, this Denon receiver only offer  one remote control, while the 4311 offers two. For my needs, this is not a big deal and I can live with one remote control if it means I save $1000 on a home theater receiver.</p>

<p>I still get the in command series, in fact this is the best in command receiver you can buy from Denon right now and the discrete amplifier design away from the processing mans not  only will two channel sound great, but home theater will come alive too with Audessy Multi HQ support that offers a more realistic profile for your high definition sound. The seven HDMI inputs are more than enough for me to get all my blu ray players and even cell phones connected too. This is definitely  a contender as I decide what home theater receiver I want to buy this year.</p>

<p>The Denon 2312 is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004Z0S7JW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004Z0S7JW"><strong>the first Denon receiver on sale in 2012 that is priced under $1000</strong> </a>and if you want to save $200 when you compare the 2312 to the 3312, then this might just be the best receiver to buy. I don’t know about you guys but I feel like I am just now getting into the real world pricing of home theater receivers. Let’s assume you make $50,000 a year. Do you really want to spend over one tenth of your salary on a home theater processor. That’s why I am starting to lean towards buying  the Denon 2312 – it’s a modern and affordable home theater reciever.</p>

<p>But just because we’re starting to hit the more affordable Denon AV Processors doesn’t mean that this is a high quality amplifer worthy of my attention.</p>

<p>I don’t know what speakers you need to drive with this amplifier but at 105 watts x 7, that’s enough and I don’t need, or have room for – a 9 channel setup  anyway.</p>

<p>Airplay, and modern HDMI specifications are far more important to me as I work more and more with digital data sources and less with analog. And at a price I could probably convince my wife to comply with, that alone may be the reason  I buy <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004Z0S7JW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004Z0S7JW">this particular Denon receiver</a></strong> over any other HT receiver by Denon.</p>

<p>The Denon 2112 gets even cheaper still, and depending on your home theater needs might do just fine when it comes to  either buying your first home theater receiver, or if you are doing what I am needing to do, and that’s save for a newer model.  At a suggested price of $650 and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004Z0S7OM/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004Z0S7OM"><strong>priced even less</strong> </a>online, and is one to consider as we start to enter the  range of home theater receivers under $750.00.</p>

<p>The 2112 still comes packed with lots of power – 90 watts per channel x 7 and like all the 2012 Denon’s HDMI 1.4a is supported for all 3D formats and with six HDMI ports and support for online music whether through Airplay or streaming through  your iPod, iPad, iPod touch or even itunes –  the wireless support on the 2112 opens you up to the world of streaming music online.</p>

<p>And the networking compatibility of this home theater receiver from  Denon also includes the compatibility of streaming music from Pandora, or even viewing your flickr photos on the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/mn/search/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;x=0&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;y=0&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;field-keywords=LCD%20TV&amp;url=search-alias%3Daps">big screen TV  </a>in the comfort of your own home.</p>

<p>The Denon AVR 1912 is getting real close to being the <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004U403XQ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004U403XQ">best home theater under $500</a></strong>, and as the year progresses I think we will see this happen. Currently, the MSRP on the 1912 is $549, so technically it’s the under $600 category but the price should drop on this some, as I am hoping to convince the wife that at only $500 we need this to enjoy our home theater even moreso than we are right now.</p>

<p>For just over $500, you get all the features of the big boys such as 7.1, Network Steraming (I think this feature is a must in 2012)  and full HDMI 1.4a support with six in and one out –  enough for most families just wanting to unwind after a day’s work. And with 90 watts x 7, for  a grand total of 360 watts of power.</p>

<p>If you have an iPad or IPod, you can even stream music to your Denon receiver straight from the  Apple Device – no wires needed.</p>

You have 90 watts x 7 and a setup wizard to help you get your home theater amplifier set up properly, the easy operation via the online graphical interface and 6 HDMI 1.4a inputs with one out will suit both the budget and the family room too.</p>

<p>All the high resolution audio  formats are supported too, like Dolby True  HD and DTS-HD  and  with an optional dock, you can connect your Apple iPod to this cheap Denon receiver too.</p>

For most of us, even a five channel home theater is more than enough for most rooms that double as a family and media room more than a dedicated HT..</p>

<p>But just because the 1612 from Denon comes with the capability of running just five speakers, does not mean that this is lacking  in the features you need for gaming, or TV and yes, even movie watching. The 75watts x 5, while a fraction of what the big Denon recievers cost, you have to remember that this receiver will cost less than the sales tax on the higher end  Denon receivers too.</p>

<p>The Denon 1612 still supports HDMI 1.4a format and with 4 HDMI ports for input and one HDMI port for output  this might be a great bargain on a home theater receiver from Denon.</p>

<p><strong>What Denon Receiver to Buy?</strong></p>

<p>For my needs, I need a 2012 model, and unless I get a deal on a**<a href="http://www.amazon.com/mn/search/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;field-keywords=refurbished%20denon%20receiver&amp;url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;sprefix=refurbished%20denon%2Caps%2C160"> refurbished denon </a>, i will only consider models **ending in 12, so that knocks off the 5308 and Denon 4810 and even the Denon 4811 is now a year old, so those are out.</p>

<p>I then have to determine my needs and what I will be using the receiver for. If the cheap Denon 1312 will do the trick, I have no problem in saving money on a Denon AV receiver if the cheapo Denon’s will do the trick.  My movie and  TV watching are only a few hours a week, and  truth be told, I  didn’t  use most of the features of my high end Yamaha.</p>

<p>If  I do decide to buy a more expensive Denon receiver, I will probably go with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004Z50L6E/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004Z50L6E"><strong>Denon 3312</strong> </a>as my big receiver from Denon. With a retail price of just over $1000,  this is a feature rich Denon receiver and probably about as high as I want to go when spending my hard earned money on an AV receiver this year. I have a hard time parting with more than one thousand dollars on any reciever or electronic device as these things depreciate pretty quick and when it’s time to resell or upgrade to the next latest receiver,  I hate to take too big a hit for the the pleasure any receiver  can provide, not  just from Denon.</p>

<p>I will tell you that regardless of what receiver for home theater I end up buying, I will <strong>buy my Denon  from Amazon</strong> as I find  they  have the best prices on Denon Receivers for both<strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/mn/search/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;field-keywords=refurbished%20denon%20receiver&amp;url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;sprefix=refurbished%20denon%2Caps%2C160#/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias=aps">new Denon’s</a></strong>  and<strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/mn/search/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;field-keywords=refurbished%20denon%20receiver&amp;url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;sprefix=refurbished%20denon%2Caps%2C160"> refurbished Denon receivers in 2012</a></strong>.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2011/11/1-terabyte-external-hard-drive-prices-continue-to-drop/">1 Terabyte External Hard Drive Prices Continue To Drop</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>I’m old enough to remember when a 1GB hard drive was almost unthinkable, let alone a 1TB external hard drive, and now that 2TB and even 3 and 4GB hard drives come on to the market I thought I would take a look at some current real world street prices for a few external hard drives currently on sale:</p>

<p> </p>

<h1 id="toshiba-canvio-basics-portable-hard-drive-320-gb-usb-20-external-hard-drive1"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004SHBUYG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004SHBUYG">Toshiba Canvio Basics Portable Hard Drive 320 GB USB 2.0 External Hard Drive</a></h1>

<p> </p>

<p>Here’s an external hard drive from Toshiba that’s much cheaper than you could find for a 1TB model. Granted, it’s only 320GB compared to 1TB, but I could get my entire music collection on this hard drive and still have room left over. And the price can’t be beat for a small drive you can carry around with you that’s small enough to fit into your pocket or purse.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<h1 id="western-digital-my-passport-essential-se-1-tb-usb-3020-ultra-portable-external-hard-drive2"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0049AS38I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0049AS38I">Western Digital My Passport Essential SE 1 TB USB 3.0/2.0 Ultra Portable External Hard Drive</a></h1>

<p> </p>

<p>And if you do need more storage, the 1TB Western Digital Passport Essential Drive is one of the better deals for 1TB drives today. For a backup drive of  all your important files and the like, the price for this hard drive could be priceless. The fact that it’s on sale today is a bonus too.</p>

<h1 id="western-digital-wd-elements-2-tb-usb-20-desktop-external-hard-drive3"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QEBMCI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QEBMCI">Western Digital WD Elements 2 TB USB 2.0 Desktop External Hard Drive</a></h1>

<p>This hard drive from Western Digital offers even more storage space and for the price (not the suggested price – the real price you pay online) it might be the best deal on big external hard drive today. 2TB holds a lot of files and movies and music.</p>

<h1 id="seagate-freeagent-goflex-desk-3-tb-usb-30-external-hard-drive4"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005IA844G/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B005IA844G">Seagate FreeAgent GoFlex Desk 3 TB USB 3.0 External Hard Drive</a></h1>

<p>With a big 3TB hard drive like the GoFlex Desk 3TB USB 3.0 External hard drive you get even more storage space for even less money. If a 1TB drive is going to cost about $100,for a few dollars more you can have 3x the hard drive space when you compare the two hard drives and the cost the 3TB is the best cost to hard drive space ratio.</p>

<h1 id="western-digital-my-passport-essential-500-gb-usb-3020-portable-external-hard-drive5"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0041OSAZS/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0041OSAZS">Western Digital My Passport Essential 500 GB USB 3.0/2.0 Portable External Hard Drive</a></h1>

<p>Lastly, the 500GB option is great for small and portable storage requirements today and a fantastic way to extend the space of your desktop or notebook space requirements. That 80GB drive you have in your notebook doesn’t seem so big now and these hard drives are a great way to expand the space without breaking the bank and having to buy a brand new notebook just because you ran out of storage space.</p>

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>First, I want to say that considering we are in the last bit of 2011 and the last iMac refresh was in May, (MacBook Pros for 2011 were just released in  October) I would **wait to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004YKXGIK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004YKXGIK">buy an iMac</a> right now **as there’s a very good chance we’ll see new iMacs models released  in 2012.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/41cC5NM63DL._SL500_AA300_.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4187" title="Should  I Buy an iMac Now?" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/41cC5NM63DL._SL500_AA300_.jpg" alt="Cheap iMac Deals" width="300" height="300" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Is 2012 The  End of the iMac?</strong></p>

<p>Over the years, notebooks and now tablets have become increasingly popular so the one question I have to ask is will there even be an Apple  iMac  in 2012?  The iPad in a way has all but replaced the iMac except for two important options :</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>screen size. A 27 inch iPad would be pretty heavy  (and expensive)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Full size keyboard. You can’t touch type on a tablet. You could possibly connect a third party keyboard to an Apple iPad, but then you really have something that resembles a notebook or MacBook Air mor than a tablet.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>I know that having a big screen can be more beneficial than having a faster processor (as I type this, I have 87% of my processor doing nothing at all) The iMac is/was a success due to the design over all else. That all in one design is attractive and cable free. This can’t be overlooked when marketing to the small office or home  computer crowd.</p>

<p><strong>Wait and See. </strong></p>

<p>As I write this,  the iMac has been a current model for over six months –  a lifetime when talking about computers. Apple’s release schedule  has been pretty much spot on the past  few years – new iMacs in early spring and maybe an iPad, early winter for  notebooks, and fall for the iPod and holiday shopping market.  I can see a  new iMac in about May 2012,  so  if you  can wait to buy a new Apple iMac,  I would  – if for no other reason to see what Apple does next.</p>

<p>Both the Apple iMac and MacBook Pro lines are in need of a makeover and Apple is rumored to make the MacBook Pro of 2012 more like the MacBook Air, and  the design on the  iMac has been the same for so long I wonder if Apple will release a brand new desktop computer in the summer of 2012?</p>

<p>Only time will tell of course, but I would think it  would be wise to hold off until summer 2012 if you can to  see what the new or replacement iMacs end up looking like. I think the wait will be worth it.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005CWIVYI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B005CWIVYI"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4190" title="add ram to macbook pro " src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Screen-Shot-2012-03-13-at-2.45.56-PM.png" alt="cheap macbook pro memory" width="296" height="305" /></a></p>

<p>I never really understood why this question even needed to be asked. I mean when you consider the price you pay for even the cheapest MacBook Pro and then compare the cost of a RAM upgrade it makes no sense to me why when you buy a MacBook Pro you wouldn’t increase the MacBook Pro’s ram at the same time.</p>

<p><strong>The Price of MacBook Pro Memory </strong></p>

<p>An example. Let’s say you’re waiting for the new MacBook Pro to be released but you can’t wait – you need to buy a MacBook Pro today, so you go shopping for a deal and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005CWIVYI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B005CWIVYI">you find one</a>.  You manage to <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/save-79-00-on-a-brand-new-apple-macbook-pro-13-3-inch-notebook/" title="Save $79.00 on a Brand New Apple MacBook Pro 13.3 inch Notebook">save almost $80 on a brand new Apple MacBook Pro</a>. This means that compared to walking into the  <a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple Store</a> you shopped online, found a better deal on a MacBook Pro than you could  have got from Apple and you probably even qualified for free shipping too.</p>

<p>This leaves you with $79.00 in savings to do what with? Buy RAM for your MacBook Pro ! At the time I write this it costs about  $40 or so for 8GB of RAM and if you shop around for 16GB  you can get that too for not much more. But, for  the sake of this article we’ll stick with the 8GB as this doubles your RAM without terminating  your warranty. Apple currently only supports 8GB of RAM on the  MBP’s so we’ll stop there for now.</p>

<p>This leaves you with another $30 to buy a MacBook Pro  stand or  a small MacBook Pro case for you  new laptop.</p>

<p>Oh, the bonus is that you <strong>have  enough RAM to do  other stuff  with</strong>. I’m writing  this on a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004YLCLM6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004YLCLM6"><strong>2011 Apple Mac Mini</strong> </a> (a birthday pressent)  and the very first thing I did  was upgrade my RAM. I’ve got a few windows open and iTunes running and I am  using over the 4GB the Mac Mini already shipped with.</p>

<p>What  happens when you don’t have enough memory? You use swap disk space  which is exponentially  slower and slows your system down considerably   – so  much  so that any speed  benefit you thought you may  have by buying a fast MacBook Pro could be negated when the swap disk kicks in.</p>

<p>MacBook Pro ram is not the cheapest it’s ever been, but close (It was down close to $30 for 8GB earlier this year), but even at the slightly  higher ram prices for Apple MacBook Pro,  upgrading  the RAM is the biggest bargain in computing today.</p>

<p>Here’s a few ram prices  for you to check out:</p>

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>One of, if not the favorite companies I have come across in my efforts to move to the USA was to switch cellular providers from Rogers in Canada to Verizon in the USA  thanks to the possibility of their Canada Wireless plans that allow me to call both the US and Canada as if it  were one big country.</p>

<p><strong>About Verizon</strong></p>

<p>Verizon wireless is a pretty big wireless company and not only offers cellular service nationwide, they recently increased their customer base with the release and addition of the Apple iPhone 4  to compliment  the mostly<br />
Android based smartphone lineup.</p>

<p>This cellular company is also more than just about wireless products and services, but they also specialize in Cable TV,  Internet and landline phones for your  home or home office, and their business services cater to tools and services for all a business needs in 2012.</p>

<p>How are they able to grow and afford to offer all these products and services? Verizon is a public company with stocks traded on the stock market, which means either big gains in income or losses depending on the day or even time. How to you keep track of the stock prices? By checking what Verizon is currently being traded at</p>

<p><strong>Verizon Stock Checking </strong></p>

<p>Verizon’s stock symbol on the NYSE is **VZ, **a nice and short name that’s easy to remember. I have never bought or sold  stock in my life, so I will not lead you astray with my advice, but instead offer a few sites where you can check Verizon stock quotes (usually with a delay, and not real time stock prices for Verizon) and learn more about this publicly traded communications company.</p>

<p>I’m still plunking away on my 2008 MacBook Pro and one thought I had to squeeze a few more months out of it until I saw what the 2012 MacBook Pro notebooks looked like would be to install a <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/best-ssd-hard-drives-for-2011/" title="Best SSD Hard Drives for 2011">MacBook Pro SSD drive</a> into this aging MacBook Pro of mine to squeeze a tad more life out of what I’ve already got and have paid for.</p>

<p>A MacBook Pro SSD drive shouldn’t cost more than $200 or so and I’ve found that 128GB SSD’s are priced at about $200 which is the price point I want to be at. The 64GB SSD’s are the cheapest SSD drives for MacBook Pro you can buy but they’re not the largest and by the time you install an OS on them there’s not a lot of room left for my files and music.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I would love a 500GB SSD drive that would allow me enough room for my entire music collection to be stored on the SSD, but the costs for 500GB or even 250GB is still pretty pricey , especially considering I want to install an SSD in an older Mac, I don’t think this is the best money spent.</p>

<p><strong>Cheap MacBook Pro SSD Drives </strong></p>

<p>Not that I do a lot of shopping for computer upgrades, but when I  do the first place I check is at Amazon as I have found that for most items, whether it’s solid state drives for MacBook Pro or even a brand new MacBook Pro, it’s hard to beat them when it comes to price and the cheapest SSD drives for both Apple and PC are  on sale at Amazon for a much better price than anywhere else.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2011/11/macbook-pro-2012-vs-imac-2012-which-one-should-i-buy/">MacBook Pro 2012 vs iMac 2012. Which One Should I Buy?</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>It’s time for a bit of predicting of the future today, partly due to the fact that I’m due for a new computer to buy in 2012 as my MacBook Pro I’m writing this on is close to becoming obsolete but due part to fiscal constraints, it will be 2012 when I am ready to pull the trigger on new MacBook Pro or  iMac, regardless of the year.</p>

<p>In the meantime, I can speculate on what may be coming down the pipe from Apple in 2012 when it comes to both the 2012 MacBook Pro and Apple iMac.</p>

<p><strong>2012 MacBook Pro</strong></p>

<p>My guess is that the new MacBook Pro  will look an awful lot like the current 2011 MacBook Air lineup with a more sleek design than current MacBook Pro models and the optical drive will get the kiss of death. The only reason I have a need for an optical drive is to watch my DVD collection and I find I could easily sell my DVD’s and get a netfliz account instead.</p>

<p>What Apple may do is to offer an external optical drive like they do with the Macbook Air.  I  think it’s silly to have two 13 inch MacBook models, so I wonder if  Apple may discontinue the MacBook Air with a 13 inch screen and just offer the 11 inch version if at first glance you can’t tell the two computers apart. The only thing I can think of holding back this idea is processor speed and solid state drive prices. They may still offer two versions: a lite spec’d MacBook Air version and a more heavy duty MacBook Pro.</p>

<p>There’s also the 2012 MacBook Pro price to consider. Apple can’t raise the prices on the MacBook Pros or everybody will buy competing windows OS machines, and they can’t drop them too much too on the MacBook Pros either as this will kill the MacBook Air sales.</p>

<p>So, it’s my opinion the MacBook Air will stay the same for the time being and we’ll see the MacBook Pro ditch the optical drive, shed hopefully a pound or more to compete with the upcoming ultrabook models from Acer, Samsung and the like and possibly lower the prices slightly due to lower component costs (that said, if the SSD drives are big enough the MacBook Pro could see a  price increase to compensate for the price of the solid state drive in the 2012 MacBook Pro)</p>

<p><strong>2012 iMac. </strong></p>

<p>I don’t see what Apple can do with the  Apple iMac. One of the selling points of the iMac is the All in One design that offers cable free desktop computing.  If you take away the optical drive you may get a bit thinner and cheaper Apple desktop, but except from offering faster processors, drives etc there’s not much one can do to the iMac. It’s not  like they  can shrink the screen any. One option may be to switch the iMac over to iOS instead of Mac OS as this is a consumer based computer and the iPad sales are strong. Would an big iPad on a stick work? Maybe.</p>

<p>Personally, I don’t need a touch screen iMac and could do just fine with leaving the Apple iMac alone. One option might be  to drop the price some on the iMac to the under $1000 mark and yet offer more speed, better display. It’s my opinion that the iMac is all about the ease of use and the display. I can buy a $399 notebook computer with a 15.6 inch LED display, so for a few more inches of display space the over thousand dollar price point seems a bit pricey.</p>

<p><strong>RAM won’t matter. </strong></p>

<p>I could be wrong, and  I hope so because I soon could be out of a job,  but adding more memory to either the Apple iMac  or the MacBook Pro won’t be as big of a deal as it once was.  Out of the box now in 2011 , both Macs come with enough ram for the task in which they were designed (OK, the  MBP is a little low), but with the iMac and to a lesser degree, the MacBook Pro the factory ram from Apple is more than enough RAM for every day tasks. I don’t  know about you folks, but I do most of my work  in the cloud already and the 4GB of RAM I have on my current MacBook Pro is not limiting in any way.</p>

<p>I hope Apple drops the price of the MacBook Pro or the iMac for 2012. Windows 7 is pretty good for most tasks and it’s getting harder and harder for me to justify the premium a new Mac computer commands. I’d  love to be able to buy a new MacBook Pro in 2012, but I may have to start investigating other notebook options from PC manufacturers depending on what we see from Apple in new and exciting products for 2012.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2011/11/where-to-find-mobileme-login-information/">Where To Find MobileMe Login Information</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>MobileMe from Apple is Apple’s first (and in my opinion, failed) attempt at iCloud. The big feature of  MobileMe was email synchronization between your Apple iPhone, Mac, or even Windows PC, as well as being able to sync your photos from iPhoto, calendar from iCal and to sync any data from iDisk.</p>

<p>I never really used anything other than the email sycnhronization between my MacBook Pro and iPhone and even though it was expensive at $100/year for this service, it worked pretty well. and I never used the find my iphone service as I never did lose my iPhone. I did launder my iPhone at one point and the iPhone did not take to being washed and dryed too well. The only solution was to buy a new Apple iPhone.  Thankfully, my service provider in Canada (rogers) felt sorry for me and valued me as a customer and offered me a deal on a replacement iPhone as opposed to having to buy a replacement iphone at  full price.</p>

<p>Anway, back to the MobileME Login: One of the biggest advantages I found with mobileme email was that it allowed me to have access to my email anywhere I had access to a notebook (mac or pc, no difference)  where I could login and read and reply to my email on a more comfortable computing environment. Yes, I could have used my iPhone but sometimes I travel to the US and the data charges for using your iPhone in the USA are astronomical and this is where the value of mobileme  really shone as it allowed me to still check my email while away.</p>

<p>To login to your mobile me account, all you really need to do is <a href="http://me.com">visit me.com</a> or <a href="http://mobileme.com">mobileme.com</a> and enter your username and password. With the announcement of iCloud, the end is near for mobile me as iCloud from Apple seems to be a better product than what Mobile Me ever was. The folks at Apple extended my mobileme membership for  well into next year – a nice gesture considering I was paying $100 a year for their service.</p>

<p>Mobile Me reviews stated that this could have been a much better service, and I think with iCloud Apple got it even better but if you just need a way to sync your email from your mobileme account to your phone I found the Mobile Me service worked pretty well for me and to me it was worth the 8 bucks or so a month to have email on my iPhone and my Mac fully synchronized.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2011/11/where-to-find-hotmail-messenger-download/">Where To Find HotMail Messenger Download</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>As I wrote about earlier, I’m not much of a fan of  hotmail products and prefer to use the Google products instead such as Gmial and even Skype for chatting as I can make phone calls too, but with very big market using the Windows OS I want to take a moment and explore the Hotmail Messenger for 2011 as its’ been some time since I’ve had an opportunity to do so.</p>

<p><strong>HotMail Messenger is actually MSN Messenger</strong></p>

<p>I missed this news, but it seems to me that somewhere along the line hotmail got sold to microsoft so now there really is no hotmail messenger software you can download but you need to download MSN messenger instead, which is probably a big plus for users as the MSN brand is much much bigger than hotmail will be in 2011.</p>

<p>MSN Hotmail Messenger pretty much changes the game and you can choose to downoload MSN messenger or if you prefer, use skype. I use skype because the people I choose to connect with also us this software so I don’t  really  have much of  a need for MSN messenger.</p>

<p>But, you can never learn too much about any subject I find so let’s have a look at MSN messenger and have a look at the main features it provides. One thing I have found is that MSN messenger for windows is leaps and bounds better than MSN messenger for Mac with the windows version offering the features I wanted and  needed, but on the Mac, not so much.</p>

<p>The folks at microsoft offer a 40% discount on a high definition video camera that allows you to make HD video calls. You may want to also check Amazon for web cameras as I have found they offer the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;ref_=nb_sb_ss_sc_0_7&amp;field-keywords=hd%20webcam&amp;url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;sprefix=hd%20web%20&amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">best prices on HD web cameras</a> too.</p>

<p>You can also connect your MSN messenger  account with your facebook account too so you can chat with your facebook friends by using MSN messenger instead of using the facebook chat feature.</p>

<p>Windows Phones come with with MSN messenger pre-installed of course, so you can use your smartphone to chat with friends and  family too, and if you have an android smartphone you can download and install a MSN messenger chat. It should come as no surprise that there’s no  Apple iPhone MSN messenger app available on the MSN site, at least officially that I am aware of.</p>

<p>Overall, the <a href="http://explore.live.com/messenger">MSN messenger download</a> looks like a great way to connect with friends and family in 2011.</p>

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>Guess what 123 inkjets sells? You got it  – Printer Ink and Toner! and according to them you can <a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-1548159-10471664">save up to 76 percent on ink and toners supplies</a> compared to what you would pay for the name brand inkjet refills, which can be sometimes worth more than the printer they were designed for.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-1548159-10471664"><br />
<img class="alignleft" style="border-style: initial; border-color: initial; border-image: initial; border-width: 0px;" src="http://www.awltovhc.com/image-1548159-10471664" alt="123inkjets.com - Printer Ink, Toner, &amp; More!" width="300" height="250" border="0" /></a></p>

<p>I have never had good luck with printers,  and the more I think of it the more frustrated I get. Ink for your printer is kindof like gas for the car. If you don’t have ink the printer won’t run  and if you’re like me you wait until the last second to get new ink for your printer and you end up paying full retail price.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>With Age, Comes Wisdom</strong></p>

<p>But, the older  I get the more I begin to value preventive more than reactive when it comes to solving problems and the one problem you can solve quite easily is to be sure you’ve got enough ink ahead of time. But who want’s to pay full load for printer ink so you can stick it in the drawer? You’re much better off to be prepared and one way for that to happen and  save money on printer ink is to buy your ink ahead of time – whether you’re in charge of and entire offices’ full of office supplies or, like yours truly you just work out of a small office this advice still holds true.</p>

<div>
  <span style="color: #0000ee;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br /> </span></span><strong>How much can you save on printer ink? </strong>My little epson inkjet is one of the first printers I have had that actually does what it&#8217;s supposed to do and just print and copy when you need it. It&#8217;s a good little printer. But to buy ink directly from Epson will cost me about $38.00 and yet if I buy the compatible ink from 123 inkjets I&#8217;ll spend more in initial outlay, but I get 14 ink jet cartridges for just $79.00. That&#8217;s double  the savings and I never have to worry about ink for my printer for some time. I&#8217;m not a heavy printer user so I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if I got a year or more out of my printer ink purchase.

    <h1><a href="/2011/11/itunes-download-help/">iTunes Download Help</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>Apple iTunes is one of the last Apple Applications I use as I find it much easier to work with a soundtrack playing to help me get my work done faster than if I had to work in silence, and  I also am able to rent movies with Apple iTunes too, all by downloading free software from Apple that allows me to listen to my music, find new music and movies ( I’m not much interested in TV shows from Apple, but they are available) and the best part is that the iTunes download is free.</p>

<p><strong>Almost Free iTunes Software</strong></p>

<p>There’s no such thing as free most times and you usually have to exchange some sort of value to <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/download/">get your free Apple iTunes download</a> and before you can start to download the free Apple software you’re required to do two things: you have to provide Apple with your email address and what country you are in as well. In my case, this means my country options are Canada and either english or french, and there’s also two check boxes asking  you if  you would like to receive the new on itunes newsletter that from what I can gather comes out weekly, and also whether you want to be kept up to date on all the other Apple news on Apple products in addition to the emails about what’s on sale at the iTunes store.</p>

<p>If you’re unsure Apple answers your questions on why you may want to receive all this stuff. I have found that Apple is pretty good with emails and only sends a handful of emails over the year about new products and as a fan of Apple computer I like to know what’s up anyway so  I leave the default as checked and enter my email address.</p>

<p>Once I have made my deal with Apple I am now able to download Apple iTunes for free  and install it on my Mac or PC with ease and start to add music to my library if this is a brand new Apple iTunes install or if it’s an Apple iTunes upgrade I can start to enjoy the benefits and security updates the new iTunes software download offers.</p>

<p>Downloading Apple iTunes is pretty easy and safe. You do have to surrender your email address to get the free iTunes software but I feel that’s a fair price for the value offered by Apple’s iTunes software.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2011/11/who-has-the-best-memory-compatibility-checker/">Best Memory Compatibility Checker Helps you Buy RAM</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>One of the very first questions you need to ask when shopping for a new computer is what type of ram do I need? And the second being what type of ram does my computer need and once you have this data you can go shopping for ram online and get the best price on your computer memory upgrade. The Best Memory Compatibility Checker can help you do this easily.</p>

<p>But what if all you know is your computer name? Or, for a lot of computer models the computer name is a long line of numbers that doesn’t exactly roll off the tip of your tongue with ease. An example might be the computer I am using to type this article with: an Acer <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005GSK6BY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B005GSK6BY">Aspire 5552-7474</a>. This is a pretty long name for a computer when you compare it to a more palatable name like Apple iMac, and it’s hard to figure out what RAM you need for both computers.</p>

<p>With the cheap Acer, you have to be sure you buy the ram for that specific computer as Acer makes many notebook computers from the smallest netbook computer to the the fastest, you need to be sure you install the right RAM for you PC, because it’s possible  to fry your computer if  you install the wrong ram into your notebook or desktop.</p>

<p>With the Apple iMac, in 2011 there’s 5 different Apple iMac models, and who knows what a 2012 Apple iMac will bring and how many models that Apple will release next year. You need to be sure, again, that you buy the  right ram for your Apple iMac  as all iMac memory does not  work in all computers.</p>

<p><strong>Check Your Memory Upgrades Before You Buy</strong></p>

<p>One of the best ways to be absolutely certain you get the right ram for your Mac or PC every time is to use a memory configurator of some sort to assist you in buying the right ram for your PC and these sometimes can be called Memory Compatibility Checker or some other name like memory finder tool or ram search, or  if you already know the RAM you need than you can just shop by type. If you know  you need to buy DDR3 1333Mhz sodimms for your  notebook, many memory stores list the RAM by memory  speed which makes it easy to buy ram.</p>

<p>One of the better ram checkers or tools to use is from <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">Crucial technology</a> as this memory store not only offers  a memory checker for every computer ever introduced,  they offer a gaurantee  that the memory you buy for your computer will work with your PC, which is something a lot of other computer memory stores don’t offer. They will happily sell you ram, but you should be sure to get the best deal by confirming the ram is indeed the right ram for your computer.</p>

<p>Regardless of what memory store you buy RAM from, the use of a Memory Compatibility Checker is a fantastic tool to get the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">best ram at the best price every time</a>.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2011/11/how-i-fixed-my-hotmail-signin-problems/">How I Fixed My HotMail Signin Problems</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>One of the biggest problems I have this year is being able to manage my email for all email addresses I have in one simple email mailbox. For the longest time,  I was using Apple Mail for my email as I was drinking the Apple Kool Aid full force and used not only Apple products exclusively but also relied on Apple mail servers to deliver email through my .me email account.</p>

<p>But this need for Apple as my default email addresses have changed and I find myself looking for other email alternatives, and one of the solutions I had used many years ago was for hotmail as my email address. The problem was I forgot both my hotmail username and password as the last time I had used hotmail was years ago – before hotmail became a microsoft product and was still a seperate and one of the first to offer free email for everybody.</p>

<p>I tried a few different usernames I thought I may have used by then as the username you pick in your 20’s tend to be an entirely username  you pick in your 40’s – at least I tend to feel that way. I’ve grown up some. But they all didn’t work as now Microsoft is asking for my Window Live ID which I have no idea on how to find as I’ve been a true blue Mac user.</p>

<p>At first I tried to use what  I thought might be a reasonable username for Hotmail, but nope, no luck. I tried to use the ‘forgot your password’ feature that is offered at the hotmail sign up page but I guess my hotmail account didn’t transfer  over either from being a dormant email account for so long or that when MS bought hotmail they weeded me out. Either way, I was screwed when it came to logging into my old hotmail account, so after a while I just decided  to not bother signing up for hotmail at all, as I already have a .me and gmail account.</p>

<p>What I ended up doing was to forward all my email to Google  Gmail as I find that Gmail has an outstanding spam filter. The Apple Mail also offers a spam filter too but I didn’t feel it was doing a good job.  And, I recently switched smartphones from an Apple iPhone to a Motorola Droid 3 and again  – I felt the Gmail was doing a better job than than the Mobile Me  on the Android platform so I made  the switch to Gmail and never looked back.</p>

<p>To be fair to the Apple Mail I have yet to switch over to the Apple Cloud as I find myself relying less and less on Apple products over the past year and I feel that competitors are offering much more value in 2011. Apple does still make some outstanding products no doubt about that but I’m becoming less and less willing to pay the premium Apple demands.</p>

<p>I ended up fixing my hotmail signin  problem by just giving up and using a competitor’s product instead that allowed me to login easier than I could with what is now, Microsoft Hotmail.</p>

<br>

		<div class="post-content">I have owned these Sennheiser headphones for more than five years now, but only recently have they seen any real great use from me but I thought hey, I may as well write a quick review on these as they have withstood the test of  time, and  as I see when I check prices for Sennheiser headphones, <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TDZOXG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000TDZOXG">they sure have come down in price too</a></strong>.

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TDZOXG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000TDZOXG"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4291" title="sennheiser hd-25 review" alt="best price on HD-25's" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/JIM_33701-600x398.jpg" width="600" height="398" /></a>

<em>The HD-25' are  a pretty sweet sounding headphone for the money. </em>

When I first bought these, I paid way more money than what you can get these great headphones for now, as I paid over $400 and now with a bit of shopping for some of the better deals on headphones you can get  a much better price.

These are closed back headphones, and except for using apple earbuds or my favorite earbud headphones - the <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004RE5ZCI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004RE5ZCI">Sony MDR EX 310LP</a>, </strong>so I can't compare how they sound  to  open backed headphones like the HD600 or HD650, but I can guess the sound signature would be similar across the sennheiser line for 2012.

<strong>How Do They Sound?</strong>

Oh, boy. Reviewing audio equipment is much trickier than say <a href="http://www.dcresource.com">digital camera reviews </a>where you can take photos and  compare. the output.

Audio is so subjective anyway. My wife loves bass and top 40 hits, while to my brother in law prefers more treble. So, unlike audio magazines I won't  glow about these phones and  how they changed my life with their detailed highs and deep bass because everybody has a preference.  To me, they sound pretty good. I can wear them for hours without fatigue and they have no problem with music from a high end  audio rig or just an iPod or iPad.

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4290" title="Sennheiser HD 25-1" alt="cheap sennheiser HD 25-1" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/JIM_3371-600x398.jpg" width="600" height="398" />

Truth be told, I'm not an expert  on music , but I know what I like and these little senny's  are really  a good headphone and  though I  haven't heard the beats line of products from Monster, I could hazard a good guess that these would offer much more value.

<strong>Not Noise Canceling, But Close</strong>

One of the reasons these little headphones are so good is due to their design. The closed back means you don't have a lot of sound leakage when wearing these  - either noise going out or in, and this allows you to immerse yourself  in what's important and that's the music. I never got the idea of noise canceling  headphones that tended to add noise instead of just blocking  out the outside noise in the first place.

But you're not entirely shut off from the world when listening to these headphones, meaning you can still be aware  of  your surroundings. Perhaps due to lifestyle mostly (I'm an old guy and stay inside)  I tend to use these in and ar0und  the house as opposed to using  them  as street headphones. On the rare occasions I do need headphones outside, I tend to use the Sony earbuds.

<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/JIM_3369.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4288" title="Sennheiser headphones on sale" alt="Beats or Sennheiser?" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/JIM_3369-600x398.jpg" width="600" height="398" /></a>

<em>The senny's are detailed and offer a realistic and  neutral sound that doesn't flavor the recordings </em>

<strong>Comfortable Headphones </strong>

I have two confessions to make when it coms to these headphones - the very first was that at first they were the most uncomfortable phones I have ever used, but then I realized two things: I have a pretty big head which isn't helping matters any and the second thing is  that  I didn't  realize until very recently that you could seperate the headband for a better fit. This is one of those times that reading the manual would  help. I found that by leaving the headphones over the back of my couch for a few hours fixed the problem of the headphones being too tight.

Also, because I wear glasses - the phones are on hear headphones  and not over the ear, so there's pressure on your ears which in turn was pressing on the arms of my glasses and that was uncomfortable to say the least. If I adjust the glasses on my head so there's less pressure on the glasses frames I fare much better and can listen for a few hours every listening  session.

" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/JIM_3368-600x398.jpg" width="600" height="398" /></a>

<strong>Summary </strong>

These are lightweight headphones at just over 5 oz, so I find them to be light, comfortable, and precise and neutral when it comes to sound, that I like. I've never had to, but you can replace the earpads and replace the cable with an audiophile cable if you wan't  to customize the HD-25's further.  If there's one qualm I do have is that the cable connection to the  phones can get loose and I'm down to just one channel instead of stereo headphone listening. A wiggle  of the red connector fixes this with ease and this does not happen often enough to be a problem .

<strong>Where To Buy Sennheiser HD 25  for  the Lowest Price.</strong>

I have found that despite shopping elsewhere <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TDZOXG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000TDZOXG">Amazon is the best price on these headphones</a> </strong>than any other store and they're now on sale for much less.

Truth be told, I'm not an expert  on music , but I know what I like and these little senny's  are really  a good headphone and  though I  haven't heard the beats line of products from Monster, I could hazard a good guess that these would offer much more value.

<strong>Not Noise Canceling, But Close</strong>

One of the reasons these little headphones are so good is due to their design. The closed back means you don't have a lot of sound leakage when wearing these  - either noise going out or in, and this allows you to immerse yourself  in what's important and that's the music. I never got the idea of noise canceling  headphones that tended to add noise instead of just blocking  out the outside noise in the first place.

But you're not entirely shut off from the world when listening to these headphones, meaning you can still be aware  of  your surroundings. Perhaps due to lifestyle mostly (I'm an old guy and stay inside)  I tend to use these in and ar0und  the house as opposed to using  them  as street headphones. On the rare occasions I do need headphones outside, I tend to use the Sony earbuds.

<em>The senny's are detailed and offer a realistic and  neutral sound that doesn't flavor the recordings </em>

<strong>Comfortable Headphones </strong>

I have two confessions to make when it coms to these headphones - the very first was that at first they were the most uncomfortable phones I have ever used, but then I realized two things: I have a pretty big head which isn't helping matters any and the second thing is  that  I didn't  realize until very recently that you could seperate the headband for a better fit. This is one of those times that reading the manual would  help. I found that by leaving the headphones over the back of my couch for a few hours fixed the problem of the headphones being too tight.

Also, because I wear glasses - the phones are on hear headphones  and not over the ear, so there's pressure on your ears which in turn was pressing on the arms of my glasses and that was uncomfortable to say the least. If I adjust the glasses on my head so there's less pressure on the glasses frames I fare much better and can listen for a few hours every listening  session.

<strong>Summary </strong>

These are lightweight headphones at just over 5 oz, so I find them to be light, comfortable, and precise and neutral when it comes to sound, that I like. I've never had to, but you can replace the earpads and replace the cable with an audiophile cable if you wan't  to customize the HD-25's further.  If there's one qualm I do have is that the cable connection to the  phones can get loose and I'm down to just one channel instead of stereo headphone listening. A wiggle  of the red connector fixes this with ease and this does not happen often enough to be a problem .

I have owned these Sennheiser headphones for more than five years now, but only recently have they seen any real great use from me but I thought hey, I may as well write a quick review on these as they have withstood the test of  time, and  as I see when I check prices for Sennheiser headphones, <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TDZOXG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000TDZOXG">they sure have come down in price too</a></strong>.

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TDZOXG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000TDZOXG"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4291" title="sennheiser hd-25 review" alt="best price on HD-25's" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/JIM_33701-600x398.jpg" width="600" height="398" /></a>

<em>The HD-25' are  a pretty sweet sounding headphone for the money. </em>

When I first bought these, I paid way more money than what you can get these great headphones for now, as I paid over $400 and now with a bit of shopping for some of the better deals on headphones you can get  a much better price.

These are closed back headphones, and except for using apple earbuds or my favorite earbud headphones - the <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004RE5ZCI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004RE5ZCI">Sony MDR EX 310LP</a>, </strong>so I can't compare how they sound  to  open backed headphones like the HD600 or HD650, but I can guess the sound signature would be similar across the sennheiser line for 2012.

<strong>How Do They Sound?</strong>

Oh, boy. Reviewing audio equipment is much trickier than say <a href="http://www.dcresource.com">digital camera reviews </a>where you can take photos and  compare. the output.

Audio is so subjective anyway. My wife loves bass and top 40 hits, while to my brother in law prefers more treble. So, unlike audio magazines I won't  glow about these phones and  how they changed my life with their detailed highs and deep bass because everybody has a preference.  To me, they sound pretty good. I can wear them for hours without fatigue and they have no problem with music from a high end  audio rig or just an iPod or iPad.

<p>The Apple Mac mini was an innovative attempt to tap into the consumer market with an entry level Mac desktop computer. The Mac mini is remarkable for its small size as well as the fact that it comes with no display, keyboard or mouse—and after its initial introduction, no built in optical drive. Apple promoted this as BYOKDM (aka “Bring Your Own…” and was aimed at users who might already have these compatible peripherals to justify the lower cost.</p>

<p>The original Mac Mini did not include a server version but did have an optical drive. Going forward from the first Mac mini revision in the summer of 2010, all versions of the mini included the server version as part of the Mac OS X operating system, the 2011 configurations eliminated the optical drive.</p>

<p>The Apple Mac mini Intel Core i5 2.5 GHz features the aluminum unibody design that replaced the original chassis which featured a polycarbonate top and bottom panels on the aluminum case. The unit measures 7.7 inches (19.7 cm) square and 1.4 inches (3.6 cm) tall. It weighs 2.7 pounds (1.22 kg). The processor that shipped with the computer was a 2.5GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 with 3MB on-chip shared L3 cache, custom configurable to 2.7GHz dual-core Intel Core i7.</p>

		<div class="post-content"><p>The Apple iMac 2.5GHz Intel Quad-core i5 was first introduced May3, 2011 and represented a significant improvement in processor speed and state of the art connectivity.</p>

<p>The Apple iMac 2.5 GHz i5 shipped with a 32 nm, 64-bit Intel Core i5 “Sandy Bridge” processor with quad cores (4 independent processor cores on a single silicon chip, each with one thread). Each core has a dedicated256k level 2 cache and the processor cores share a single 6 MB level 3 cache It also supports Turbo Boost 2.0 (up to 3.3 GHz) — which “automatically boosts the processor speed based on workload” (that is if an application is only using one of the four cores it will automatically increase the speed of the core in use and turn off the unused cores).</p>
