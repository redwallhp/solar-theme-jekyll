		<div class="post-content"><p>To date, I’ve written a lot about Apple Memory as I’m drinking the Apple kool aid and never could get my mind around the windows thing, although lots have and this is not to fault them. This is not a Mac vs PC rant . Whatever works for you, works.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004K1EQO6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004K1EQO6">Cheapest Dell NoteBook</a></strong></p>

<p>Right, memory. Regardless of what hardware you have such as HP Dell Apple and Sony to name a few computer manufacturers you’ll do yourself a big favor if you upgrade the ram and memory in your computer. RAM allows your OS to breath if you will. Rather than have to access data from your hard drive, which is slower – RAM can be bought and installed in your dell computer which will allow the often needed data to be stored and accessed quickly and when needed.</p>

<p>Let’s help you get the right memory for your Dell Computer, shall we?</p>

<p>**Dell Inspiron Mini 1012 Memory<br />
**<br />
The Dell Inspiron Mini 1012 comes standard from dell with 1GB of RAM but can be expanded to 2GB by replacing the factory installed 1GB PC2-4200 sodimm and replacing it with a bigger 2GB memory upgrade</p>

<p><strong>Dell Inspiron M101z Memory</strong></p>

<p>The Dell Inspiron M101z ships from Dell with 2GB of DDR3 1333MHz RAM but you can and should increase the ram to 8GB of RAM. To do this, replace the 2x1GB memory chips and replace thew with 2x4GB memory upgrades for Dell M101z</p>

<p><strong>Dell Inspiron 15 Memory</strong></p>

<p>The Dell Inspiron 15 (1545) ships from Dell with 1GB of RAM so a 4GB RAM upgrade to the maximum is reccommended for maximum Inspiron 15 performance.</p>

<p><strong>Dell Inspiron 14 Memory</strong></p>

<p>The Dell Inspiron 14 (1440) offers 2GB of RAM standard from the factory and can be upgraded to 4GB of DDR3 1066 sodimms</p>

<p><strong>Dell Inspiron 14R Memory</strong></p>

<p>The Dell Inspiron 14R starts at 2GB of RAM as standard memory configuration and can be upgraded to 8GB of ram using ddr3 1066 SDRAM sodimms. To upgrade to 8GB of RAM you would replace the two 1GB RAM memory modules with larger 4gb RAM for Dell Inspiron 14R.</p>

<p><strong>Dell Inspiron 15R Memory</strong></p>

<p>The Dell Inspiron 15R Laptop starts from the dell factory shipped with 3GB of DDR3 but can be upgraded by installing 4GB x 2 memory upgrades for Dell Inspiron 15R</p>

<p><strong>Dell Inspiron 17R Memory</strong></p>

<p>The Dell Inspiron 17R notebook, or laptop comes from dell with 3GB DDR sdram sodimms installed but you can remove these and install 2x4GB DDR 1066 memory for much greater performance for your new dell. You can install up to 8GB of memory into the Dell Inspiron 17R notebook</p>

<p><strong>Dell Studio 15R Memory</strong></p>

<p>The Dell Studio 15R ships with just 2GB of RAM for operating with, which is too little, I think. You’re much better off upgrading the Studio 15R from dell to the maximum 4GB of RAM by installing 2x2GB PC2-6400 sodimms.</p>

<p><strong>Dell Studio 17 Memory</strong></p>

<p>Dell Studio 17 (1749) is desktop replacement computer for some so it makes the most sense to upgrade the memory on this big screen beauty and it will take up to 8GB of RAM for better performance. Install 2x4GB DDR3 1066 SDRAM sodimms and you’ll never want for more memory again.</p>

<p><strong>Alienware M11x Memory</strong></p>

<p>The Alienware M11x will accept up to 8GB of RAM and you can buy memory for Alienware M11x pretty cheap by adding 2x4GB DDR3 1066MHz for maximum memory performance from your alienware notebook or laptop</p>

<p>**Alienware M15x Memory<br />
**<br />
The Alienware M15x accepts up to 8GB of memory by replacing the 3GB of RAM it ships with and upgrading to a much more useable 8GB of RAM for Alienware M15X by replacing the memory with 4GB DDR3 sodimms</p>

<p><strong>Alienware M17x Memory</strong></p>

<p>The Alienware M17x also runs better with 8GB of RAM when you replace the 4GB that came standard. Install DDR3 1066 4GB x 2 and watch your Alienware run at blazing fast speeds.</p>

<p>And there you have it. <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com">Dell memory upgrades</a> for the most current notebooks, netbooks and laptops currently on sale by Dell.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2010/08/ram-price-list/">RAM Price List</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p> <br />
Maybe you’re in the market for ram and memory, or maybe you want to buy a dogde ram truck (you have the wrong site if that’s you need). Let’s stick to ram and memory, shall we? It’s tricky to shop for ram . One memory store I came across had five different ways you could shop for ram:<br />
When you have a ram price list in front of you you’ll be able to see at a quick glance what the best ram price for your needs will be.When you’re in the market for memory, whether you’re looking to compare prices on ram upgrades or you just want to buy some ram or memory from a store you can trust you’re usually wanting to refer to one thing and that’s a ram price list of some sort.</p>

<p>shop by ram type</p>

<p>shop by ram brand</p>

<p>shop by computer manufacturer</p>

<p>download software and it will tell you what ram you need.</p>

<p>shop by memory configurator – you use the pull-down menus and select your computer manufacturer, and model name of your computer and the memory configuration tool tells you what ram you need and usually returns a ram price list of all the ram available for your desktop or notebook computer from Apple, Dell, HP and so on..</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW">Cheap RAM</a></strong></p>

<p>The ram memory configurator is the most popular to use when shopping for ram, whether it’s for your PC or Mac. Some memory stores really promote this tool (crucial comes to mind), while other stores prefer you to know what type of RAM you need.</p>

<p>When RAM shopping, if it gets too complicated you can always email me and I’ll do my best to help or I’ve made few price lists for ram over the years that will help you get the best deal on ram upgrades. And by best deal, I don’t mean lowest price.<br />
Some other memory price trackers (even google does this) emphasizes low prices as the best price but with RAM this isn’t the case a lot of the times. Some of the lowest price memory stores I used to track have gone out of business over the years, while the higher priced but still competitive memory stores are still in business after all these years.</p>

<p>These are the memory stores I track and monitor – the memory stores that are reputable and offer a fair price on ram. Every ram store at very least uses the memory configurator as it’s the easiest method to shop for ram. All you have to do is enter your make and model of computer and back comes a specialized <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com">ram price list</a> with the best memory prices available for your specific computer.</p>

		<div class="post-content"><p>What is the best RAM memory price?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1318" title="Best Selling RAM" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-3.30.51-PM.png" alt="Cheap Kingston RAM" width="307" height="184" /></a></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW">Memory Prices Have Dropped in 2010</a></strong></p>

<p>There are a few variables to determine what RAM Memory Price is for you and best suits your needs when it comes to shopping for ram upgrades, or memory upgrades. (For the remainder of this article, RAM and Memory will be used as they have the exact same meaning.</p>

<p>RAM is the best upgrade to your computer that you can do. In fact, I whole heartedly suggest you max out your memory – especially if you are looking to upgrade a netbook or laptop computer as there’s a lot of performance in your portable computer but the manufacturers have this bad habit sometimes of only installing the minimum ram required to start the operating system.</p>

<p>The reasons computer makers like Apple, Dell, HP, Toshiba and others do this is simple: price. Memory is not free (yet) and it costs more money to configure a computer with the maximum memory possible so what they have done to become more price competitive is to transfer the cost to you and allow you to bear the cost.</p>

<p>Oh sure – Apple, Dell and all will be happy to sell you ram for your new notebook (or desktop) but it won’t be the cheapest ram you can buy by any stretch. These are big companies with lots of overhead, employees, distribution networks and other costs that tend to mark up the price of ram to silly amounts by the time it gets to you. Dell, Apple and company are interested in one thing: profit. Not saving you memory on ram.</p>

<p>But you don’t neccessarily want to increase the coffers of the big computer makers: you just want ram for for your laptop or desktop at a fair price. Maybe it’s the lowest price you can get on ram or maybe you’d prefer to spend a little more but whatever you choose you can get a much better deal on ram than when you buy it from the big computer manufacturers.</p>

<p>Part of the reason you can buy RAM cheaper from various 3rd party memory stores is that you’re buying generic ram. What’s generic ram? You’ve seen the no-name cereal at the grocery store, yes? It’s the same idea -you’re still buying corn flakes but you don’t get the fancy box or brand. Some memory stores actually carry two or more different types of RAM: Generic memory and brand name RAM so you can decide what ram to buy and whether you want to save money on ram or whether you’re willing to spend more and buy name brand ram, only you can decide that – as it’s your money you are spending on ram and memory.</p>

<p>But whatever you choose you can get the best <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com">RAM Memory Price</a> by comparing ram prices and make an informed memory buying decision.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2010/08/cost-of-macbook-pro-ram/">Cost of MacBook Pro RAM</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><div style="float: right; margin-right: 5px;">

<div style="float: right; margin-right: 5px;">

<p>The <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_Pro_KITS_(1066_DDR3)/">cost of MacBook Pro RAM</a> is dropping.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The MacBook Pro memory modules get bigger in capacity size (not physical size) A year ago or so 4GB of RAM would have been tth most memory you could install in a MacBook Pro but now the MacBook Pro specifications have changed and you can now get 8GB of RAM into a MacBook Pro easily and relatively cheaply.</p>

<p>At time of writing and 8GB memory or ram upgrade kit for the new 2010 MacBook Pros can easily be achieved with just adding 2x4GB DDR3 1066Mhz so-dimms from a variety of memory stores for much much less money than you would pay for MacBook Pro memory just a year ago.</p>

<p>Every time I upgrade the memory prices they drop. At the time of writing it will cost you about $250 for an 8GB memory upgrade for a MacBook Pro. Now if you buy the MacBook Pro from the Apple Store you’ll end up paying a whole lot more than that – about double or more ($600 for MacBook Pro RAM from Apple as I write this) and there was a time when RAM mattered but really now it’s just what your budget will allow.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I"><img title="Cheapest Apple MacBook Pro" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-3.05.45-PM.png" alt="Best MacBook Pro Prices" width="294" height="209" /></a></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I">Cheapest Apple MacBook Pro</a></strong></p>

<p>When you buy the Apple RAM from Apple you get one thing and one thing only: better support. I’m not saying that when you buy the RAM elsewhere that it doesn’t come with great support but if you bought the RAM and the MacBook Pro from Apple you do get the reward of being able to take your MacBook Pro back to Apple and there’s less chance of Apple telling you your problems are due to the third party memory. It’s an easy way for Apple to get out of warranty troubles and blame the troubles you might be having with your MacBook Pro on the ‘bad ram’.</p>

<p>But no RAM is ‘bad ram’ these days. Any shady or questionable memory vendors have pretty much been wiped out by either their tactics catching up with them or the recession wiped ’em out completely. It’s like natural selection for memory stores if you will.<br />
RAM is a price competitive market and those that compete on price too much usually don’t last long due to the fact that they can’t afford the service that comes with the sale of MacBook memory.</p>

<p>The question of what is the best price for MacBook Pro RAM, or any ram for that matter is up to you. What do you want to pay for service and support? Buying RAM direct from apple is easy, yes but you’ll pay for the privilege of buying Apple branded memory upgrades.</p>

<p>You’re better off spending your money on RAM Upgrades and<a href="http://www.ramseeeker.com"> buy from memory stores you can trust</a> at prices that are much more competitive than any price that comes out of Apple for MacBook Pro RAM.</p>

<p><strong>Buy RAM for iMac.</strong> Do it. If you have an Apple iMac (or are considering buying an Apple iMac) you should fill that sucker with RAM.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8IO6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8IO6"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1316" title="Cheapest Apple iMacs" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-3.28.35-PM.png" alt="Best Deal on Apple iMacs" width="297" height="273" /></a></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8IO6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8IO6">Best Apple iMac</a></strong></p>

<p>I’ll tell you why, too. I’m going to guess that you bought that Apple iMac for the looks, the simplicity even maybe because it was the best deal on an Apple iMac you could get and you couldn’t pass on such a great Apple iMac Deal. Whatever your iMac buying reasons, there’s one thing you want it to do: run without problems.</p>

<p>More RAM for iMac does this. It allows your Apple iMac to breathe, if you will. All the technical mumbo-jumbo aside when you buy more ram for you iMac (and install it yourself, it’s easy) you give a fresh blast of fresh air to your computer. Ever been in a small space, say like an elevator and it’s just a little too…close? The iMac feels the same way when it’s running the numbers for you and massaging all that data for you so you can surf facebook or even make money with your iMac (if you’re using your iMac to make money than the argument for adding more iMac RAM just increased ten fold) . Your iMac need some space. We’re talking working space here. RAM for you iMac is like buying a bigger house. All of sudden you’ve got a bigger place and your iMac can run free and do all that heavy computing for you – all because you bought iMac RAM.</p>

<p>**Where to Buy RAM for iMac?<br />
**</p>

<p>[table id=2 /]</p>

<p>Yes, you can buy ram for iMac from Apple – and you may think that this is the best solution – they made the computer, right? So of course all the geniuses at the Apple store can help you with ram upgrades – and they can. You can order ram for the iMac online too and you can get it from the Apple Store. The problem when you buy ram from apple directly is hoo boy is it pricey.<br />
You do get the excellent apple support and at one time, there was actually apple ram and windows ram but not any more – as long as RAM for your iMac meets the apple specifications, you can buy iMac RAM a lot cheaper from more than one memory store.</p>

<p>As luck would have it, I have made a list of all the places you can buy ram for iMac. There’s lots more stores than the memory stores I list of course, but all the memory stores I list I can recommend. In fact, most memory stores have been selling ram for iMacs since the very first iMac with that funky teal color and round mouse and for that you get piece of mind knowing you can buy iMac ram for less but it’s still guaranteed to work in your iMac without trouble. And in the slight chance that there is a problem with your <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/iMac_KITS_(DDR3_1333)/">RAM for iMac,</a> these stores will work with you to sort out any ram problems you might have with your iMac RAM.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_Pro_KITS_(1066_DDR3)/">best MacBook Pro RAM</a> is best price you can get for MacBook Pro Memory.</p>

<p>You might prefer to <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com">order RAM</a> directly from Apple. Yes, it’s expensive for what it is (you’re more than halfway to a new macbook). But you do get great support from Apple in the slight chance that something goes wrong. For no other reason Apple won’t be able to give you a hard time for non-apple memory if you have MacBook Pro problems down the road (hey, it’s possible). Apple won’t be able to give you the run around about not using apple memory and might blame the bad ram on the third party ram.</p>

<p>But I know a better way to get the best MacBook Pro RAM and it sure doesn’t include Apple. In fact, I’ve got a handy-dandy price lis of all ram for macbook pros from very reputable online memory stores that appreciate and respect the Apple user and customer. In the past the list used to be longer but after a while I got tired of all the complaints about certain online stores (you know who you are) so I’ve settled on this bunch of memory stores to list MacBook Pro RAM prices as they offer fair prices on MacBook Pro memory and in the small chance you do have problems with your MacBook ram, they will be there for you just like Apple will but at least they’ll be a lot cheaper than apple memory.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW"><img title="Best MacBook Pro RAM" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-3.25.50-PM.png" alt="Cheapest MacBook Pro RAM" width="309" height="208" /></a></p>

<p>DDR3 1066 for MacBook Pro is the memory type you want and if you’ve got a Spring 2010 MacBook Pro (or some older MBP’s too) you can upgrade to the maximum of 8GB of RAM and I suggest you do to get the most out of your MacBook Pro. You spent a good dollar on your MacBook Pro to get the fancy extra firewire, faster processor, light up keyboard and a bunch of other features, so it seems silly to me to scrimp on RAM. RAM prices for MacBook Pros have dropped considerably for the 1066 DDR 3 memory and now what you would have paid over$1000 for you can now buy 8GB of RAM for MacBook Pros for less – about $250 as I write this. That’s about half what you’d pay if you bought from Apple too. There’s nothing wrong with Apple RAM but you pay for it. Even brand name ram like Crucial is loads cheaper for MacBook Pro RAM.</p>

<p>Buy the most RAM you can afford for your MacBook Pro and you won’t regret buying MacBook Pro RAM as your MacBook will be topped up and running at maximum performance too, and that’s the best MacBook Pro RAM – The maximum RAM in your MacBook Pro at an affordable price you are comfortable with when shopping and buying ram for your MacBook Pro.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2010/08/ram-and-memory-for-the-2010-mac-pros/">RAM and Memory for the 2010 Mac Pros</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>I have as of this morning added memory and ram prices from four memory stores so far that list and sell apple memory for the new Apple Mac Pro models just released:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ZR4M6I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B003ZR4M6I"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1323" title="Best MacBook Pro Deal" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-3.36.15-PM.png" alt="Cheapest MacBook Pro" width="210" height="273" /></a></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ZR4M6I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B003ZR4M6I">Cheapest Apple Mac Pro</a></strong></p>

<p>These are for the Mac Pros that now require 1333MHz  RAM. The 1066Mhz memory is still a current model as now any Mac Pro you buy could take two different types of RAM depending on what 2010 Mac Pro you buy and want to upgrade the memory for:</p>

<p>The 2.4GHz Apple Mac Pro still use the same 1066Mhz DDR SDRAM DIMMS that previous models use. My guess is that Apple will discontinue this Mac Pro model sooner or later once the faster memory and processors get cheaper. (they always do)</p>

<p>The 2.66GHz and 2.93GHz Apple Mac Pro models is where the new 1333Mhz RAM applies and now you’ve got a slew of selections to choose depending on what Mac Pro you have and how much memory you want to install in them.</p>

<p>As always I have added two different methods you can shop for memory: by looking for prices on individual<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/Mac_Pro_DDR3_1333/" title="mac pro memory modules"> Mac Pro memory modules </a>or by shopping for ram as a package deal and buying it in a memory upgrade kits.

<p>The new MacBook Pros from Apple come standard with  4GB installed as default.  Some of the older MacBooks can also accept a maximum of 4GB and until just recently – as in a month ago – 4GB was the maximum in most MacBook Pros on sale by Apple.</p>

<p>To answer your question? It depends.</p>

<p>[table id=15 /]</p>

<p>I know it sounds kind of vague so let me explain: I’ve got a text document open and so it takes some RAM to run Mac OS and  a wee bit more to launch and keep open the application  (and a few other application  I have open like Mail and Safari ).</p>

<p>And then my Mac waits. for me. Even if I could fill my MacBook Pro with 64GB of RAM my mac’s still going to be waiting for me to type another letter or character. I type about 40 words per minute and let me tell you the speed of the RAM is much faster than that.</p>

<p>But let’s say I then go out and record a full HD movie at the biggest full high definition resolution and download that video to my computer so I can share with my friends the great time I had at the beach or dinner or whatever..I made a movie and I want to share it.</p>

<p>But first I want to edit the movie and take out the part where I dropped the camera in the sand and then there was the part in the movie where I was just loading the car so I don’t want my friends to see all the junk I have in my trunk. I also want to make some cool little  titles  and fades and other stuff in iMovie so  at the end of the movie my friends say “wow that’s a great movie”.  To do all that is going to take a whole lot more ram than the stock ram configuration that comes with the MacBook Pro. And even if I could do all my movie editing with the current ram – more ram can’t hurt. Moving those pixels around whether it’s still or video takes a whole  lot more processing power and memory than the stock configuration of MacBook Pro.</p>

<p>Also there’s the saying, and I’m sure you’ve heard it: You can never have enough ram or hard drive space. I’ve never regretted buying RAM. Even if it’s been too much at the time of purchase. RAM is cheap. You can fill  up your MacBook Pro for about $200 and this  is much cheaper than some software like Photoshop or Lightroom even.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_Pro_(1066_DDR3)-4gb/" title="4gb ram macbook pro">4GB for the MacBook Pros </a>will do just fine for facebook, email and light computing such as word processing. When you get into the processor intensive stuff like photo editing or movie editing  – buy all the RAM you can afford.</p>

<p>That’s a question I get asked a lot – probably second after ‘what is the best memory, or what is the cheapest memory. And ramseeker isn’t the easiest to navigate sometimes if you don’t know what type of memory you have I also get asked what ram do I need for my computer? (BTW,  if you need help with your memory upgrades feel free to email me. I’m here to help you with your ram upgrades)</p>

<p>Back to the best RAM brand. There’s two ways you can buy ram: one that will save you the most money or for a little more money you can buy brand name ram which comes with the knowledge that you paid a bit more for your ram but at least it’s a brand name you can trust.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW">Kingston RAM: Best Selling Memory Upgrades</a></strong></p>

<p>This applies to anything, really and not just ram. Even computers are priced this way – you can buy an Apple Computer  (and pay for the privilege) or you can buy a lesser bran  name.  Once I needed a PC to run some windows program so I found the  cheapest laptop I could find. It worked great for the price but support was non-exisitent as when I needed help with my PC (it was a windows machine. it’s only a matter of time before you need help) the company was long out of business. It was a no-name laptop and I got no-name support to match.</p>

<p>With RAM though you’re better off because even generic memory gets tested to work from the memory vendors before it ships and if you buy ram regardless of brand from the stores I list you won’t have a problem with RAM not working. These stores are all reputable memory vendors and I have mentioned this before.</p>

<p>Some brands you might see are toshiba, samsung, micron (which is crucial), lexar for digital camera ram…just to name a few. It all comes down to your comfort level and what’s most  important to you – getting the cheapest RAM you can buy or spending a  littl more for brand name ram. Your budget and memory needs  all come into play when you need to buy memory – brand name or generic, the choice is ultimately up to you.</p>

<p>So you want to know the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/pc/index.php#lowest" title="cheapest pc ram">cheapest ram right now</a>?</p>

<p>Before I can answer that we need a bit of information before I can begin to help you. Do you have a mac or pc? Are you looking for ram for your digital camera? how about a memory stick?</p>

<p>What size of RAM can your mac/pc/digital camera take?</p>

<p>What type of memory can your mac/pc/digital camera use?</p>

<p>We’re not done yet.  Do you have a memory or ram budget? You’re in the market for the cheapest RAM and you’re definitely at the right place but I want you to understand that price – and this is for any thing, not just ram – is only part of the package deal when shopping for RAM and Memory Upgrades</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00200K1SY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00200K1SY"><img title="Cheapest Camera RAM" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-3.43.05-PM.png" alt="Cheap RAM for Digital Cameras" width="290" height="314" /></a></p>

<p>Do you care if the ram is name brand ram or are you happy with generic ram? How about used ram? That actually would be the cheapest ram, but it’s used and  any savings you might acquire buy shopping for used ram could be eaten up by support costs and other habits. You can sell your old ram too and that would make your new ram even cheaper or at very least – offset the costs of  ram when you are ready to buy new ram.</p>

<p>How about a gurantee? do you need one?  What if by chance, the ram goes bad. Do you want or need a 1-800 phone number to call? Are you OK with email support? Are you a whiz kid who knows all there ever needs to know about ram and memory and you’re just in the market for the lowest price ram and you don’t care about support for your ram purchase.</p>

<p>These are all things to consider when  you need to buy ram and you are in the need for cheapest ram. The cheapest ram for an older notebook for blogging means a whole other thing if you’re looking to upgrade hundreds of computers at the same time. Saving a few dollars in ram in this case might not be worth it.</p>

<p>How are you going  to pay for the ram . Visa, mastercard?  Paypal? <a href="http://www.canadianonlinebanking.com" title="canadian online banking">wire the money</a> to the vendor? Purchase Order? All of these different payment offer differernt fee structures and payment terms. For the hobbyist a credit card works best probably. For the commercial order you’re probably want to go with a store that will accept your PO. so  you can cross the ‘upgrade office computers’ task off your to do list.</p>

<p>Once you’ve decided  on all these options and probably a few I haven’t even thought of then I can help you<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="buy the cheapest ram"> buy the cheapest RAM </a>for the right price with the right features you need for your application.</p>
