Unfortunately you cannot upgrade a MacBook to 8GB of RAM or Memory. **Yet**.

To get 8GB into an Apple notebook you&#8217;ll need to be working with a MacBook Pro as one of the advantages is that the MacBook Pro models can accept and recognize more  RAM than the lesser MacBooks and that&#8217;s just one of the few differnces when you compare the two macbook lines from Apple

The good news (and we&#8217;re talking about 2010 MacBook and MacBook Pros here is that you can  upgrade your MacBook to 4GB &#8211; and for the market the MacBook is aimed at (ie: consumer and educational market) 4GB of RAM is more than enough RAM for your MacBook. If you need 8GB of RAM than consider the MacBook Pro 13 inch if you want to fill a MacBook with 8GB of RAM.

[<img title="Best Price 8GB MacBook Pro" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-3.09.11-PM.png" alt="Cheapest MacBook Pro 8GB" width="309" height="214" />][1]

**[Best Apple MacBook Pro 8GB RAM][1]**

But forget about 8GB for MacBook Pros for  a second as we&#8217;re going to assume you have a MacBook or are considering buying a MacBook and regardless: you need more RAM for your MacBook.

The good news is 4GB MacBook RAM is much cheaper than 8GB of MacBook Pro RAM anyway so do yourself a favor and upgrade your MacBook and sell the original RAM that came with your MacBook back  to the memory stores. I know that OEMPCWORLD and RAMJET are just two memory stores that will buy your memory back from you. This is one way to offset the cost of your MacBook RAM upgrade even more as now you can upgrade your MacBook for even less. Currently a 4GB memory upgrade kit for MacBook  is priced under $100 whereas 8GB for MacBook Pros run a little under $300 still. If you managed to sell your old MacBook Memory you&#8217;re well under $100 for a MacBook that&#8217;s maxed out with memory. Don&#8217;t go out one night, eat at home instead  (I like pizza) and you&#8217;ll have saved enough money to upgrade your MacBook to the maximum 4GB of RAM.

If you have an older MacBook you can still get at very least 2GB of ram into your older MacBook for example a black macbook from circa 2006 or so is still a very useable and viable computer and and upgrade to 2gb costs about the same as a night at the movies so it&#8217;s my opinion it would be silly not to upgrade your macbook, regardless of when you bought it or what year it is.

For MacBook RAM prices I list  [4gb macbook  upgrade kits][2] for newer models of MacBooks and if you have an older version of the Macbook you&#8217;re best off to upgrade with [2GB MacBook PC5300 DDR memory upgrade kits.][3]

I thought I&#8217;d take a minute or so and go over some MacBook Pro Memory upgrade options as Apple has this habit of calling every Pro MacBook they&#8217;ve released over the years MacBook Pro. Matte Screen, Glossy Screen, Santa Rosa, i3, i5, i7, Intel Core 2 Processors the list goes on and on.

If you&#8217;re buying a new MacBook Pro 13 inch, 15 inch, or 17 inch doesn&#8217;t matter. They all take the same RAM or Memory and that&#8217;s 1066 DDR3 sodimms. You can buy the ram from the Apple store (if you&#8217;ve got money to burn) or you can buy it from reputable third party vendors that you can trust such as: RAMJET, OWC, 18004Memory, MemoryX, OEMPCWORLD and Memory To Go. All these online memory stores know all about MacBook Pros  and what RAM goes where.

[<img title="Cheapest Apple MacBook Pro" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-3.05.45-PM.png" alt="Best MacBook Pro Prices" width="294" height="209" />][1]

**[MacBook Pros for Less][1]**

I&#8217;ve made a handy dandy little list of [MacBook Pro DDR3 1066 RAM Prices][2] and also, [MacBook Pro DDR3 1066 Memory Upgrade Kits][3]. I suggest you check out both pages to get the[ best deal on ram][4] for a new (or new-ish) MacBook Pro.

For the older MacBook Pros you&#8217;ll need [PC5300 DDR2 SDRAM sodimms][5]. This sounds like a mouthful of  technical jargon and it is but if you&#8217;ve got an older MacBook Pro  (older than  two years old) than there&#8217;s a good chance you need the PC5300 DDR MacBook Pro RAM as opposed to the newer 1066MHz  MacBook Pro RAM.

And, again I happen to have a handy list of all the memory stores you can buy MacBook Pro RAM from for both [MacBook Pro PC5300 DDR memory upgrade kits ][6]and MacBook  Pro PC5300 DDR modules priced individually.

Why the difference between the modules and the memory upgrade kits? Because over time I have found some stores list all their memory upgrades as memory modules yet others chose to market their ram upgrades as kits. You need to upgrade MacBook Pro RAM 2 at a time anyway (or at least, it&#8217;s recommended to do so) so it makes sense to sell the MacBook Pro RAM in matched pairs.

If you have no idea what RAM for the MacBook Pro you should be shopping for one quick and easy way is  to go to the Apple Menu in the top left corner of your screen (we&#8217;re assuming you&#8217;re on your macbook now) and select about your Mac. You&#8217;ll get information about your processor and memory at the same time and from there it&#8217;s easy to see as Apple tells you what ram speed you&#8217;re running and what type &#8211; exactly what you need to figure out what RAM is best for your specific MacBook Pro model.

Here&#8217;s my MacBook info as an example:

[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-276" title="MacBook Pro memory requirements" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2010-08-20-at-4.51.20-PM.png" alt="macbook pro ddr3 1066 ram" width="306" height="385" />][7]

		<div class="post-content">[table id=2 /]

I have been monitoring memory prices for iMac since the very beginning with the very first  iMac ever released and I have come to realize that this very popular computer continues to offer the best bang for your dollar when shopping for an Apple desktop computer. And the value increases tremondously if you add more RAM to your Apple iMac &#8211; especially if you choose to maximize the amount of Memory installed in  your computer.

[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1309" title="iMac RAM Memory" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-3.14.09-PM.png" alt="Cheap iMac Deals" width="297" height="267" />][1]

**[Cheapest Apple iMacs][1]**

When deciding on the best memory upgrade size to install in new computers, or iMacs rather,  our friends at Apple are most concerned with installing the bare minimum of RAM so that the Mac OS will load on the iMac and maybe an application will run &#8211; something like Apple&#8217;s Mail program or Safari the Apple web browser.

But what if  you want  to get the most performance out of your iMac? You add more memory. Memory for the Apple iMacs have dropped in price considerably especially for the larger 8gb and now 16GB memory upgrade kits. When the 4GB DDR3 1066Mhz memory for Apple iMacs first came on the scene you&#8217;d be digging deep deep deep into your pockets and you&#8217;d not be suprised to pay almost what the Apple iMac costs but just in adding new RAM or Memory. 4GB RAM was priced at almost $500 per memory module.

Thankfully with any new technology ram prices keep on dropping over time and now you can [buy 4GB DDR3 for much less][2] yet still get the benefit of maximum performance that a maxed out iMac can provide you.

And now with the newer and latest iMacs you can even expand the RAM to a whopping 16GB on the new and current Apple iMacs with intel i3, i5 and i7 processors. Just a few memory stores supply ram for the 2010 Apple iMacs but over time you can bet more and more will come online and start to supply ram for the 2010 Apple iMacs. So far, I know Crucial Technology, OWC, RAMJET and DMS stock and carry RAM for the new Apple iMacs that require the 1333MHz RAM upgrades.

[16GB for Apple iMac 2010][3] models is still a little pricey but if you make your living with your Apple iMac the price is not even a consideration really as your time is worth much more than any upgrade memory price and you should be able to recoup the investment in no time with your new iMac working away at maximum capacity.

You will not regret an iMac 2010 memory upgrade, regardless of cost.

**How much RAM do I need?**

DDR3 notebook memory in the 8GB configuration is the standard and most popular RAM upgrade in 2011:  
[table id=7 /]

**[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1296" title="Best RAM Prices" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-3.00.24-PM.png" alt="Cheapest RAM Prices" width="309" height="308" />][1]**

**[Cheap RAM from Crucial][1]**

If there&#8217;s a question I get asked it&#8217;s this: **How much memory should I buy?** And my answer always is: **buy as much memory as you can afford**. Obviously for some computer models buying a whole lot of ram is just extremely cost prohibititive &#8211; especially for high end desktop models like the new Apple Mac Pro. At the time I write this up, it will almost cost you $3000 to max out  the new [Mac Pro to 64GB of RAM][2].  I know,  that&#8217;s pretty expensive ram upgrades, but this is an exception and not a rule. This is new memory for a new computer model and ram prices historically have dropped over time.

But for consumer systems and especially notebook computer upgrades, my advice is to max out the memory with as much as possible and then forget about it until you&#8217;re ready to upgrade to your next computer. For the most part, RAM doesn&#8217;t go bad (there&#8217;s exceptions) but if you buy memory from reputable companies that sell ram usually you install the memory and you&#8217;re done. And you get years of enjoyment out of your computer. You paid top dollar for your computer so it only makes the most sense to get the maximum performance out of it.

Desktop applications might be a bit different as there&#8217;s many memory slots (at least 4) for most desktop computers and then you&#8217;ll have to do some thought and research. You might still benefit from filling your desktop with ram as it&#8217;s one of the easiest ways to get top performance out of your home or office computer. With more and more consumers interested in hobbies such as digital photography and video editing these new breed of computer users could indeed benefit from a RAM upgrade as these are applciations that thrive on lots of memory.

This is just a quide but for 2010 4GB of RAM is the new low ram upgrade and most computers start with a base of at least this amount and sometimes even more. But 4GB is a good start.  If you don&#8217;t have 4GB of RAM find out how much ram you currently have and see if you can upgrade to 4GB. If not, you might want to consider a new computer, but I recommend 4GB, but machines that max out at 2GB are still useable too. Most netbooks made ship with just 1GB as standard RAM but for notebook computers look for 2GB or more, but 4GB of RAM is where the sweet spot is in [ram upgrades today][3]

<br>

		<div class="post-content">To date, I&#8217;ve written a lot about Apple Memory as I&#8217;m drinking the Apple kool aid and never could get my mind around the windows thing, although lots have and this is not to fault them. This is not a Mac vs PC rant . Whatever works for you, works.

&nbsp;

**[Cheapest Dell NoteBook][1]**

[table id=7 /]

Right, memory. Regardless of what hardware you have such as HP Dell Apple and Sony to name a few computer manufacturers you&#8217;ll do yourself a big favor if you upgrade the ram and memory in your computer. RAM allows your OS to breath if you will. Rather than have to access data from your hard drive, which is slower &#8211; RAM can be bought and installed in your dell computer which will allow the often needed data to be stored and accessed quickly and when needed.

Let&#8217;s help you get the right memory for your Dell Computer, shall we?

**Dell Inspiron Mini 1012 Memory  
**  
The Dell Inspiron Mini 1012 comes standard from dell with 1GB of RAM but can be expanded to 2GB by replacing the factory installed 1GB PC2-4200 sodimm and replacing it with a bigger 2GB memory upgrade

**Dell Inspiron M101z Memory**

The Dell Inspiron M101z ships from Dell with 2GB of DDR3 1333MHz RAM but you can and should increase the ram to 8GB of RAM. To do this, replace the 2x1GB memory chips and replace thew with 2x4GB memory upgrades for Dell M101z

**Dell Inspiron 15 Memory**

The Dell Inspiron 15 (1545) ships from Dell with 1GB of RAM so a 4GB RAM upgrade to the maximum is reccommended for maximum Inspiron 15 performance.

**Dell Inspiron 14 Memory**

The Dell Inspiron 14 (1440) offers 2GB of RAM standard from the factory and can be upgraded to 4GB of DDR3 1066 sodimms

**Dell Inspiron 14R Memory**

The Dell Inspiron 14R starts at 2GB of RAM as standard memory configuration and can be upgraded to 8GB of ram using ddr3 1066 SDRAM sodimms. To upgrade to 8GB of RAM you would replace the two 1GB RAM memory modules with larger 4gb RAM for Dell Inspiron 14R.

**Dell Inspiron 15R Memory**

The Dell Inspiron 15R Laptop starts from the dell factory shipped with 3GB of DDR3 but can be upgraded by installing 4GB x 2 memory upgrades for Dell Inspiron 15R

**Dell Inspiron 17R Memory**

The Dell Inspiron 17R notebook, or laptop comes from dell with 3GB DDR sdram sodimms installed but you can remove these and install 2x4GB DDR 1066 memory for much greater performance for your new dell. You can install up to 8GB of memory into the Dell Inspiron 17R notebook

**Dell Studio 15R Memory**

The Dell Studio 15R ships with just 2GB of RAM for operating with, which is too little, I think. You&#8217;re much better off upgrading the Studio 15R from dell to the maximum 4GB of RAM by installing 2x2GB PC2-6400 sodimms.

**Dell Studio 17 Memory**

Dell Studio 17 (1749) is desktop replacement computer for some so it makes the most sense to upgrade the memory on this big screen beauty and it will take up to 8GB of RAM for better performance. Install 2x4GB DDR3 1066 SDRAM sodimms and you&#8217;ll never want for more memory again.

**Alienware M11x Memory**

The Alienware M11x will accept up to 8GB of RAM and you can buy memory for Alienware M11x pretty cheap by adding 2x4GB DDR3 1066MHz for maximum memory performance from your alienware notebook or laptop

**Alienware M15x Memory  
**  
The Alienware M15x accepts up to 8GB of memory by replacing the 3GB of RAM it ships with and upgrading to a much more useable 8GB of RAM for Alienware M15X by replacing the memory with 4GB DDR3 sodimms

**Alienware M17x Memory**

The Alienware M17x also runs better with 8GB of RAM when you replace the 4GB that came standard. Install DDR3 1066 4GB x 2 and watch your Alienware run at blazing fast speeds.

And there you have it. [Dell memory upgrades][2] for the most current notebooks, netbooks and laptops currently on sale by Dell.

		<div class="post-content">&nbsp;  
Maybe you&#8217;re in the market for ram and memory, or maybe you want to buy a dogde ram truck (you have the wrong site if that&#8217;s you need). Let&#8217;s stick to ram and memory, shall we? It&#8217;s tricky to shop for ram . One memory store I came across had five different ways you could shop for ram:  
When you have a ram price list in front of you you&#8217;ll be able to see at a quick glance what the best ram price for your needs will be.When you&#8217;re in the market for memory, whether you&#8217;re looking to compare prices on ram upgrades or you just want to buy some ram or memory from a store you can trust you&#8217;re usually wanting to refer to one thing and that&#8217;s a ram price list of some sort.

shop by ram type

shop by ram brand

shop by computer manufacturer

download software and it will tell you what ram you need.

shop by memory configurator &#8211; you use the pull-down menus and select your computer manufacturer, and model name of your computer and the memory configuration tool tells you what ram you need and usually returns a ram price list of all the ram available for your desktop or notebook computer from Apple, Dell, HP and so on..

&nbsp;

**[Cheap RAM][1]**

The ram memory configurator is the most popular to use when shopping for ram, whether it&#8217;s for your PC or Mac. Some memory stores really promote this tool (crucial comes to mind), while other stores prefer you to know what type of RAM you need.

When RAM shopping, if it gets too complicated you can always email me and I&#8217;ll do my best to help or I&#8217;ve made few price lists for ram over the years that will help you get the best deal on ram upgrades. And by best deal, I don&#8217;t mean lowest price.  
Some other memory price trackers (even google does this) emphasizes low prices as the best price but with RAM this isn&#8217;t the case a lot of the times. Some of the lowest price memory stores I used to track have gone out of business over the years, while the higher priced but still competitive memory stores are still in business after all these years.

These are the memory stores I track and monitor &#8211; the memory stores that are reputable and offer a fair price on ram. Every ram store at very least uses the memory configurator as it&#8217;s the easiest method to shop for ram. All you have to do is enter your make and model of computer and back comes a specialized [ram price list][2] with the best memory prices available for your specific computer.

[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1318" title="Best Selling RAM" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-3.30.51-PM.png" alt="Cheap Kingston RAM" width="307" height="184" />][1]

**[Memory Prices Have Dropped in 2010][1]**

There are a few variables to determine what RAM Memory Price is for you and best suits your needs when it comes to shopping for ram upgrades, or memory upgrades. (For the remainder of this article, RAM and Memory will be used as they have the exact same meaning.

RAM is the best upgrade to your computer that you can do. In fact, I whole heartedly suggest you max out your memory &#8211; especially if you are looking to upgrade a netbook or laptop computer as there&#8217;s a lot of performance in your portable computer but the manufacturers have this bad habit sometimes of only installing the minimum ram required to start the operating system.

The reasons computer makers like Apple, Dell, HP, Toshiba and others do this is simple: price. Memory is not free (yet) and it costs more money to configure a computer with the maximum memory possible so what they have done to become more price competitive is to transfer the cost to you and allow you to bear the cost.

Oh sure &#8211; Apple, Dell and all will be happy to sell you ram for your new notebook (or desktop) but it won&#8217;t be the cheapest ram you can buy by any stretch. These are big companies with lots of overhead, employees, distribution networks and other costs that tend to mark up the price of ram to silly amounts by the time it gets to you. Dell, Apple and company are interested in one thing: profit. Not saving you memory on ram.

But you don&#8217;t neccessarily want to increase the coffers of the big computer makers: you just want ram for for your laptop or desktop at a fair price. Maybe it&#8217;s the lowest price you can get on ram or maybe you&#8217;d prefer to spend a little more but whatever you choose you can get a much better deal on ram than when you buy it from the big computer manufacturers.

Part of the reason you can buy RAM cheaper from various 3rd party memory stores is that you&#8217;re buying generic ram. What&#8217;s generic ram? You&#8217;ve seen the no-name cereal at the grocery store, yes? It&#8217;s the same idea -you&#8217;re still buying corn flakes but you don&#8217;t get the fancy box or brand. Some memory stores actually carry two or more different types of RAM: Generic memory and brand name RAM so you can decide what ram to buy and whether you want to save money on ram or whether you&#8217;re willing to spend more and buy name brand ram, only you can decide that &#8211; as it&#8217;s your money you are spending on ram and memory.

But whatever you choose you can get the best [RAM Memory Price][2] by comparing ram prices and make an informed memory buying decision.

The [cost of MacBook Pro RAM][1] is dropping.

&nbsp;

The MacBook Pro memory modules get bigger in capacity size (not physical size) A year ago or so 4GB of RAM would have been tth most memory you could install in a MacBook Pro but now the MacBook Pro specifications have changed and you can now get 8GB of RAM into a MacBook Pro easily and relatively cheaply.

At time of writing and 8GB memory or ram upgrade kit for the new 2010 MacBook Pros can easily be achieved with just adding 2x4GB DDR3 1066Mhz so-dimms from a variety of memory stores for much much less money than you would pay for MacBook Pro memory just a year ago.

Every time I upgrade the memory prices they drop. At the time of writing it will cost you about $250 for an 8GB memory upgrade for a MacBook Pro. Now if you buy the MacBook Pro from the Apple Store you&#8217;ll end up paying a whole lot more than that &#8211; about double or more ($600 for MacBook Pro RAM from Apple as I write this) and there was a time when RAM mattered but really now it&#8217;s just what your budget will allow.

[<img title="Cheapest Apple MacBook Pro" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-3.05.45-PM.png" alt="Best MacBook Pro Prices" width="294" height="209" />][2]

**[Cheapest Apple MacBook Pro][2]**

When you buy the Apple RAM from Apple you get one thing and one thing only: better support. I&#8217;m not saying that when you buy the RAM elsewhere that it doesn&#8217;t come with great support but if you bought the RAM and the MacBook Pro from Apple you do get the reward of being able to take your MacBook Pro back to Apple and there&#8217;s less chance of Apple telling you your problems are due to the third party memory. It&#8217;s an easy way for Apple to get out of warranty troubles and blame the troubles you might be having with your MacBook Pro on the &#8216;bad ram&#8217;.

But no RAM is &#8216;bad ram&#8217; these days. Any shady or questionable memory vendors have pretty much been wiped out by either their tactics catching up with them or the recession wiped &#8217;em out completely. It&#8217;s like natural selection for memory stores if you will.  
RAM is a price competitive market and those that compete on price too much usually don&#8217;t last long due to the fact that they can&#8217;t afford the service that comes with the sale of MacBook memory.

The question of what is the best price for MacBook Pro RAM, or any ram for that matter is up to you. What do you want to pay for service and support? Buying RAM direct from apple is easy, yes but you&#8217;ll pay for the privilege of buying Apple branded memory upgrades.

You&#8217;re better off spending your money on RAM Upgrades and[ buy from memory stores you can trust][3] at prices that are much more competitive than any price that comes out of Apple for MacBook Pro RAM.

**Buy RAM for iMac.** Do it. If you have an Apple iMac (or are considering buying an Apple iMac) you should fill that sucker with RAM.

[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1316" title="Cheapest Apple iMacs" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-3.28.35-PM.png" alt="Best Deal on Apple iMacs" width="297" height="273" />][1]

**[Best Apple iMac][1]**

I&#8217;ll tell you why, too. I&#8217;m going to guess that you bought that Apple iMac for the looks, the simplicity even maybe because it was the best deal on an Apple iMac you could get and you couldn&#8217;t pass on such a great Apple iMac Deal. Whatever your iMac buying reasons, there&#8217;s one thing you want it to do: run without problems.

More RAM for iMac does this. It allows your Apple iMac to breathe, if you will. All the technical mumbo-jumbo aside when you buy more ram for you iMac (and install it yourself, it&#8217;s easy) you give a fresh blast of fresh air to your computer. Ever been in a small space, say like an elevator and it&#8217;s just a little too&#8230;close? The iMac feels the same way when it&#8217;s running the numbers for you and massaging all that data for you so you can surf facebook or even make money with your iMac (if you&#8217;re using your iMac to make money than the argument for adding more iMac RAM just increased ten fold) . Your iMac need some space. We&#8217;re talking working space here. RAM for you iMac is like buying a bigger house. All of sudden you&#8217;ve got a bigger place and your iMac can run free and do all that heavy computing for you &#8211; all because you bought iMac RAM.

**Where to Buy RAM for iMac?  
**

[table id=2 /]

Yes, you can buy ram for iMac from Apple &#8211; and you may think that this is the best solution &#8211; they made the computer, right? So of course all the geniuses at the Apple store can help you with ram upgrades &#8211; and they can. You can order ram for the iMac online too and you can get it from the Apple Store. The problem when you buy ram from apple directly is hoo boy is it pricey.  
You do get the excellent apple support and at one time, there was actually apple ram and windows ram but not any more &#8211; as long as RAM for your iMac meets the apple specifications, you can buy iMac RAM a lot cheaper from more than one memory store.

As luck would have it, I have made a list of all the places you can buy ram for iMac. There&#8217;s lots more stores than the memory stores I list of course, but all the memory stores I list I can recommend. In fact, most memory stores have been selling ram for iMacs since the very first iMac with that funky teal color and round mouse and for that you get piece of mind knowing you can buy iMac ram for less but it&#8217;s still guaranteed to work in your iMac without trouble. And in the slight chance that there is a problem with your [RAM for iMac,][2] these stores will work with you to sort out any ram problems you might have with your iMac RAM.

[Buy iMac RAM for less][3], and you&#8217;ll work faster and your iMac will run smoother too.

The [best MacBook Pro RAM][1] is best price you can get for MacBook Pro Memory.

You might prefer to [order RAM][2] directly from Apple. Yes, it&#8217;s expensive for what it is (you&#8217;re more than halfway to a new macbook). But you do get great support from Apple in the slight chance that something goes wrong. For no other reason Apple won&#8217;t be able to give you a hard time for non-apple memory if you have MacBook Pro problems down the road (hey, it&#8217;s possible). Apple won&#8217;t be able to give you the run around about not using apple memory and might blame the bad ram on the third party ram.

But I know a better way to get the best MacBook Pro RAM and it sure doesn&#8217;t include Apple. In fact, I&#8217;ve got a handy-dandy price lis of all ram for macbook pros from very reputable online memory stores that appreciate and respect the Apple user and customer. In the past the list used to be longer but after a while I got tired of all the complaints about certain online stores (you know who you are) so I&#8217;ve settled on this bunch of memory stores to list MacBook Pro RAM prices as they offer fair prices on MacBook Pro memory and in the small chance you do have problems with your MacBook ram, they will be there for you just like Apple will but at least they&#8217;ll be a lot cheaper than apple memory.

[<img title="Best MacBook Pro RAM" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-3.25.50-PM.png" alt="Cheapest MacBook Pro RAM" width="309" height="208" />][3]

**[Best MacBook Pro RAM][3]**

DDR3 1066 for MacBook Pro is the memory type you want and if you&#8217;ve got a Spring 2010 MacBook Pro (or some older MBP&#8217;s too) you can upgrade to the maximum of 8GB of RAM and I suggest you do to get the most out of your MacBook Pro. You spent a good dollar on your MacBook Pro to get the fancy extra firewire, faster processor, light up keyboard and a bunch of other features, so it seems silly to me to scrimp on RAM. RAM prices for MacBook Pros have dropped considerably for the 1066 DDR 3 memory and now what you would have paid over$1000 for you can now buy 8GB of RAM for MacBook Pros for less &#8211; about $250 as I write this. That&#8217;s about half what you&#8217;d pay if you bought from Apple too. There&#8217;s nothing wrong with Apple RAM but you pay for it. Even brand name ram like Crucial is loads cheaper for MacBook Pro RAM.

Buy the most RAM you can afford for your MacBook Pro and you won&#8217;t regret buying MacBook Pro RAM as your MacBook will be topped up and running at maximum performance too, and that&#8217;s the best MacBook Pro RAM &#8211; The maximum RAM in your MacBook Pro at an affordable price you are comfortable with when shopping and buying ram for your MacBook Pro.
