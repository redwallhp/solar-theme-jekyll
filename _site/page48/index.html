		<div class="post-content"><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref_%3Dnb_sb_ss_c_1_11%26field-keywords%3Dhp%2520notebook%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Delectronics%26sprefix%3Dhp%2520notebook&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">HP notebooks</a> keep getting cheaper and cheaper over time and they’re a great deal when you buy them for certain but you can do better and get more performance from the HP notebooks by just doing one thing that’s cheap and easy to do: add more memory or ram to HP Notebooks. You only need a philips screwdriver and a clear workspace that’s free from static electricity and you can install ram for HP notebooks yourself you don’t need to hire any computer shop or geeks to install the notebook ram yourself.</p>

<p>[table id=15 /]There’s a good chance your memory upgrades for your new HP notebook require DDR3 1333Mhz RAM, especially if your processor is Intel i3, i5 or i7 which are popular processor for HP computers in 2011. Below are the current ram prices available for HP notebooks:</p>

<p>But first you need to buy the RAM for your HP notebook and here’s something I’ll share in my 13 years or working with ram and memory: you can buy ram from third party memory stores or memory manufacturers that’s just as good but this HP memory offers one thing that buying directly from HP can’t match: RAM is cheaper when you buy it from trusted memory shops and stores. Don’t pay too much for RAM or Memory for your HP notebook. Let’s take a look at the currrent HP notebook lineup and I’ll tell you what RAM you need, and where you can get the best deal on HP Memory too.</p>

<p><strong>HP Mini 110 PC-series RAM and Memory Upgrades</strong></p>

<p>The HP Mini 110 1100 series is a wee little netbook that’s a cheap way to get into portable computing and is more than enough but it doesn’t come with enough RAM to run any applications really. It can be upgraded to more RAM by replacing the 1GB of RAM with a 2gb PC2 DDR2 6400 sdram sodimm which will allow your Mini PC from HP to run faster.</p>

<p><strong>HP Mini 210 PC series Memory and RAM upgrades</strong></p>

<p>The Mini 210 is yet another netbook from HP that comes in a few different configurations but there’s two things that are standard across the HP Mini 210 series, and that’s the fact that you can replace the 1GB DDR RAM and add a bigger 2GB DDR memory module for the HP Mini 210 PC series.</p>

<p><strong>HP Mini 310 PC series Memory and RAM upgrades</strong></p>

<p>The maximum memory for the 310 series netbooks from HP is 3gb of RAM  and to get to the maximum RAM you have to add to the 1gb that comes from the factory and is non removeable ram and buy 2gb ram for the 310 Mini series from HP to give you a maximum of 3GB RAM by installing 2gb DDR3 SDRAM sodimms.</p>

<p><strong>HP Pavilion G42-200 series notbook RAM and Memory upgrades</strong></p>

<p>The HP Pavilion G42-200xx series of notebook computer offers two memory upgrade slots that will accept and take  DDR3 PC1066 SDRAM sodimms and you can install two 4gB ddr3 sdram sodimms to get to the maximum memory for the HP Pavilion G42-200 of 8GB of RAM which is much much better than the 4GB of RAM that comes standard on this notebook computer from HP</p>

<p><strong>HP Pavilion G61-400 series notebook RAM and Memory Upgrades</strong></p>

<p>The HP Pavilion G61-400 series of notebooks comes in many different configurations so depending on your exact model number you may be able to expand your HP Pavilion G61 400 series RAM to either 4GB or 8gB of Maximum RAM. This HP pavilion ships with 3gb of RAM standard so I suggest replacing the smaller 1GB ram chip in one memory upgrade slot and buying a 2gb ram module for the HP Pavilion G61-400 notebook series. If you have model that can accept 8GB of RAM then pull the 3gb out of there and install two 4gb ram modules to max out this particular HP Pavilion G61-400 series.</p>

<p>**<br />
<strong>**HP Pavilion G61-600 series notebook RAM and Memory Upgrades</strong></p>

<p>The HP Pavilion G61-600 series ships standard with  3gb of DDR2 SDRAM RAM but you can upgrade to 4GB of RAM by replacing the 1GB RAM module with a 2gb ddr2 sdram sodimm for the HP Pavilion G61-600</p>

<p><strong>HP Pavilion G62-600 series notebook RAM and Memory Upgrades</strong></p>

<p>The HP Pavilion G62-600 series notebook RAM and Memory Upgrades ships standard with 4gb of DDR3 sdram sodimms in the two memory upgrade slots so you can put 2 x 4gb ddr3 sdram sodimms and max out the  HP Pavilion G62-600 series RAM to the maximum 8GB of RAM allowed for this high performance  HP Pavilion model.</p>

<p><strong>HP Pavilion G62-200 series laptop memory and Ram Upgrades</strong></p>

<p>The HP Pavilion G62-200 ships standard with either 3gb or 4gb of RAM  depending on the model and is broken down to the following when considering standard ram configurations:</p>

<p>The G62-220US: 3 GB DDR2 (1 x 1024 MB + 1 x 2048 MB)<br />
G62-208CA / G62-221CA / G62-220CA / G62-224CA / G62-219CA: 3 GB DDR3 (1 x 1024 MB + 1 x 2048 MB)</p>

<p>G62-237CA / G62-238CA: 4 GB DDR2 (2 x 2048 MB)<br />
G62-228CA / G62-264CA / G62-244CA / G62-223CA / G62-227CA: 4 GB DDR3 (2 x 2048 MB)</p>

<p>As you can see there’s two different types of RAM here with the lower end G62-200 models using the slower ddr2 sdram at either 3gb or 4gb of RAM standard but the higher end models use the DDR3 sdram sodimms. The good news is all these models regardless can accept 8GB of RAM as maximum memory, so it’s a good idea to upgrade to the max of 8gb using 2x4gb ram , either ddr2 or dd3 depending on your specific HP Pavilion notebook model.</p>

<p><strong>HP Pavilion G72-200 notebook PC series RAM and Memory Upgrades</strong></p>

<p>The HP Pavilion G72-200 notebook series is another model that uses both DDR2 or DDR3 SDRAM sodimms depending on the specific HP Pavilion G72 series you have. Standard memory for these HP Pavilion Notebooks is as follows:</p>

<p>G72-214CA / G72-217CA: 4 GB DDR2 (2 x 2048 MB)<br />
G72-260US: 4 GB DDR3 (2 x 2048 MB)</p>

<p>And this HP notebook too offers a maximum memory allowance of 8GB across the board. just be sure to buy the right memory for your specific Pavilion model and then upgrade by buying either 2x4gb DDR2 or DDR3 memory modules.</p>

<p><strong>HP Envy 13-100 Notebook Series RAM and Memory Upgrades</strong></p>

<p>The HP Envy 13 series from HP can be maxed out at 5gb of RAM and this is accomplished by supplementing the 1gb of ram that’s non removeable and on board and adding 1x4gb DDR3 sdram sodimms replacing the standard 2GB memory module.</p>

<p><strong>HP Envy 14-1000 Notebook series RAM and Memory Upgrades</strong></p>

<p>The HP Envy 14 series from HP ships standard with 4GB of RAM and can be maxed out to 2gb of RAM by installing 2x4gb DDR3 sdram sodimms to get a maximum of 8GB of RAM for your new HP Envy 14 series. I suggest you add the maximum HP envy RAM to get  the most out of your HP notebook computer</p>

<p><strong>HP Envy 15-1000 notebook series RAM and Memory Upgrades</strong></p>

<p>The HP Envy 15 series notebooks already ship with a healthy  6GB of RAM but you can ADD 16gb of RAM to this HP notebook and it’s one of the few notebooks that will accept and recognize 16gb of RAM, so I suggest you max out your HP Envy 15 by adding 4x4gb ddr3 sdram pc3-8500 sodimm for blazing fast notebook experience.</p>

<p>**HP Envy 17 -1000 notebook series RAM and Memory Upgrades **</p>

<p>The HP Envy 17 series notebooks can accept up to 8GB of ram by replacing the factory ram and adding 2x4gb ddr3 sdram sodimms to get  to the maximum memory for the HP Envy 17.</p>

<p><strong>HP HDX series notebook RAM and Memory Upgrades</strong></p>

<p>The HP and HDX series notebooks come in a few different configurations and the HDX16t model offers a max of 8gb ram allowable by upgrading the two memory slots to 2x4gb of ddr2 pc2 6400 DDR sodimms. The HDX 18t will also accept 8gb of RAM as the maximum memory configuration but depending on what 18t model you have you might need ddr2 or ddr3 pc sdram sodimms. Regardless its the same for each: replace the stock ram and replace it with 2x4gb ram memory modules.</p>

<p><strong>HP Pavilion dv6-1200 entertainment notebook PC series RAM and Memory Upgrades</strong></p>

<p>The HP Pavilion dv6-1200 supports up to 8gb of RAM and requires ddr2 pc2 6400 sdram sodimms and the maximum ram of 8gb is achieved by installing 2x4gb into the 2 memory upgrade slots available in this specific notebook computer by HP.</p>

<p><strong>HP Pavilion dm1-2000 entertainment notebook PC series  RAM and Memory Upgrades</strong></p>

<p>The HP Pavilion DM1-2000 entertainment notebook PC series RAM and Memory uprades are maxed out at 5gb of RAM which means to get there, you have to replace the factory ram or memory in the one available slot and install and buy a 4gb ddr3 1066 sdram sodimm dimm which will get you to the 5gb max ram for the dm1-2000 from HP</p>

<p>**HP Pavilion DM3-1000 enterntainment notebook PC memory RAM and memory upgrades **</p>

<p>The HP Pavilion DM3-1000 entertainment notebook PC series may or may not be able to upgrade your ram depending on which specific model you have: the DM3-1040US is the only  one that will accept more ram upgrades and it will accept 8gb of RAM by upgrading to 2x4gb ddr3 sdram sodimms.</p>

<p>**HP Pavilion DM3-1100 entertainment notebook PC memory and RAM Upgrades **</p>

<p>What ram you need for the DM3-1100 entertainment notebooks depends on what you’ve got: The dm3-1100us takes DDR2 memory upgrade sodimms but the dm3-1100ca uses the newer ddr3 sdram sodimms and the ddr3 model is the only model you can buy more memory for: you can install 8gb of RAM into the ddr3 version of the DM3-1100 but you can’t put any more ram into the DM3-1100 that uses DDR2 ram as it comes from HP with maximum of 4gb of RAM already installed.</p>

<p>**HP Pavilion DM4-1000 notebook PC series RAM and Memory Upgrades **</p>

<p>The HP Pavilion DM4-1000 laptop series ships standard with 4gb of RAM already installed and uses DDR3 sdram sodimms that you’ll have to pull and  install the 2×2 DDR3 sdram sodimms  and install 4gb ddr sdram sodimms in the two memory upgrade slots HP provides.</p>

<p><strong>HP Pavilion DV4-1500 entertainment notebook PC series RAM and Memory Upgrades</strong></p>

<p>The HP Pavilion DV4-1500 series notebooks from HP come standard from the factory with 4gb of ddr3 sdram installed but you can max out this enterntainment PC to 8gb of ram by upgrading the ram to two 4gb sdram ddr3 sodimms and I suggest you do. It’s easy to upgrade the RAM in your dv4-1500 and you can install the ram yourself.</p>

<p>**HP Pavilion DV4-2100 entertainment notebook PC series RAM and Memory Upgrades **</p>

<p>The HP Pavilion DV4-2100 series uses either ddr2 sdram memory or ddr3 sdram memory depending on what specific model of this series of notebook memory you require. The dv4-2120ca uses ddr2 sdram sodimms and comes standard with 4gb of ram installed and the dv4-2160 requires ddr3 sdram to operate. It comes from HP with 4gb of ram installed but you can max out to 8gb of ram buy buying 4gb DDR3 ram modules x2.</p>

<p>**HP Pavilion DV5-2000 entertainment notebook PC RAM and Memory Upgrades **</p>

<p><strong>The HP Pavilion DV5-2000 entertainment PC DV5-2000 comes in a few different configurations depending on your needs but the this notebook series from HP all ships with the same 4gb ddr3 sdram  in a 2x2gb configuration. To upgrade the hp notebook ram  you will need to replace the two 2x2gb with  2x4gb ddr3 sdram sodimms to get maximum performance out of your hp pavilion notebook.</strong></p>

<p><strong>HP Pavilion dv6-1300 entertainment notebook PC series RAM and Memory Upgrades</strong></p>

<p>The HP Pavilion DV6-1300 entertainment notebook PC series comes in 3 different models: dv6-1360us, dv6-1330ca and dv6-1350us and they all ship standard with 4gb of DDR3 sdram memory and and all three dvd-1300 series models can be maxed out to 8gb of RAM by replacing the 2x2gb ram modules with larger 4x4gb ddr3 sdram sodimms.</p>

<p><strong>HP DV6-2000 entertainment notebook PC series RAM and Memory Upgrades</strong></p>

<p>The HP DV6-2000 series lineup of  HP Pavilion notebook computers ship standard with just 3gb of RAM so you will definitely benefit  and enjoy a faster HP notebook by maxing out this particular HP Pavilion to the maximum 8gb of ram by installing 2x4gb ddr2 sdram sodimms to achieve the maximum memory allowed of 8gb.</p>

<p><strong>HP DV6-2100 series entertainment laptop PC series RAM and Memory Upgrades</strong></p>

<p>For upgrades on memory for the HP Pavilion DV6-2100 series the specific model list is very long so be sure to check exactly what model of HP Pavilion you have in this series as there’s lots to choose from. Standard configurations of RAM for this HP notebook series are:</p>

<table border="0" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="4" bgcolor="#CCCCCC">
  <tr bgcolor="#E7E7E7">
    <td valign="top" width="401">
      dv6-2164ca / dv6-2128ca: 4 GB DDR2 (2 x 2048 MB)<br /> dv6-2140ca: 4 GB DDR2 (2 x 2048 MB) 4GB DDR2 System Memory<br /> dv6-2138ca: 4 GB DDR3 (2 x 2048 MB)<br /> dv6-2130ca / dv6-2150ca: 4 GB DDR3 (2 x 2048 MB) 4GB DDR3 System Memory<br /> dv6-2120ca: 4GB DDR2 System Memory
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>and for maximum memory allowed for this computer series:</p>

<p>dv6-2120ca: 8192MB<br />
dv6-2140ca / dv6-2164ca / dv6-2128ca: Supports up to 8 GB DDR2 memory<br />
dv6-2130ca / dv6-2150ca / dv6-2138ca: Supports up to 8 GB DDR3 memory</p>

<p>Like most other series, you either need DDR3 SDRAM sodimms or DDR2 sodimms depending on your HP model number but the good news is all model in the DV6-2100 series can max out at 8gb of RAM by installding 2x4gb ram modules in the two memory upgrade slots allowed.</p>

<p><strong>HP Pavilion DV6-3000 serieas enterntainment notebook PC RAM and Memory Upgrades</strong></p>

<p>The HP Paviloon DV6-3000 series of notebook computers is another system that offers a lot of different options and specific part numbers and it’s easy to get overwhelmed when buying ram but I’m hoping I can help you get the right ram for your HP Pavilion,whatever the model number.</p>

<p>Standard memory upgrades for this model is as follows:</p>

<p>dv6-3058ca / dv6-3023ca / dv6-3054ca / dv6-3040ca / dv6-3050ca / dv6-3073ca / dv6-3070ca / dv6-3038ca / dv6-3037ca / dv6-3064ca / dv6-3043ca / dv6-3034ca / dv6-3077ca / dv6-3010us: 4 GB DDR3 (2 x 2048 MB)<br />

dv6-3084ca: 8 GB DDR3 (2 x 4096 MB)</p>

<p>As you can see, 4GB, 6GB or 8GB standard memory configurations are available and seeing as how the maximum memory in this series is 8gb of DDR3 sdram sodimms you will have to determine your model number of  HP notebook before you can determine what memory to buy.</p>

<p>**HP Pavilion DV7-2200 series entertainment notebook PC series RAM and Memory Upgrades **</p>

<p><strong>HP Pavilion DV7-3000 entertainment notebook PC series RAM and memory upgrades</strong></p>

<p>The HP Pavilion DV7-3000 entertainment PC series is avialable in a few different configruations but the memory upgrades for this HP Pavilion series of notebook computers – the standard RAM installed from HP is either 4gb, 6gb, 0r 8GB and the maximum RAM you can install in these models are 8GB of DDR3 sdram sodimms which means you will need to replace both, one or none memory upgrade modules in one or two of the HP Pavilion memory upgrade slots so you can reach the 8GB maximum RAM allowed.</p>

<p><strong>HP DV7-3100 entertainment notebook PC series RAM and Memory Upgrades</strong></p>

<p>With the HP DV7-3100 series notebook PC’s you need to pay attention to the exact model number of your computer so you can get the maximum performance of 8GB of RAM but you will need to buy DDR2 or DDR3 sdram sodimms depending on the specific HP Pavilion model you are needing to upgrade the ram for. Standard memory for this series is as follows:</p>

    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p><strong>HP DV7-4000 entertainment notebook PC series RAM and Memory Upgrades</strong></p>

<p>This is another HP Pavilion series that requires a big list and some attention to make sure you get the right ram for your computer model from HP.</p>

<p>dv7-4060us / dv7-4073ca / dv7-4070us / dv7-4063ca / dv7-4058ca / dv7-4038ca / dv7-4008ca: 4 GB DDR3 (2 x 2048 MB)<br />
dv7-4057ca / dv7-4054ca / dv7-4090ca: 6 GB DDR3 (1 x 2048 MB + 1 x 4096 MB)<br />
dv7-4074ca / dv7-4078ca: 8 GB DDR3 (2 x 4096 MB)</p>

<p>but the good news is you can upgrade your DV7-3100 notebook to a maximum 8GB of RAM but you will have to determine whether you will need 2x4gb RAM upgrades or just 1x4gb RAM to replace either one or both factory installed memory modules.</p>

<p>Wow, that’s quite a title but I just wanted to make a note that I’ve added Memory To Go RAM  to my <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/iMac_(DDR3_1333)/" title="imac ram upgrades">iMac Memory Upgrades</a> and<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/iMac_KITS_(DDR3_1333)/" title="imac memory upgrade kits"> iMac Memory Upgrade Kits</a></strong> for the new(er) i3, i5 and i7 21 inch iMacs and also 27 inch iMacs too.</p>

<p>Memory To Go offers the memory for the new Apple iMacs in both module and kit sizes so you’ll have to check both pages to get the best deal on RAM from Memory To Go for the new iMacs. I’m not going to list exact prices here as the prices will and do change  but you can always check the links I have above for current ram prices for the new Apple iMacs.</p>

<p>At the time I write this, Memory To Go has memory prices in 2gb modules for new Apple iMacs, 4GB modules for Apple iMac and 4GB ram upgrade kits for 4GB and 8GB. Oddly, there’s no 16gb kit listed even though the new Apple iMacs can accept and use up to 16GB of RAM easily. You could order 2x8gb kits or you could order or buy 4x4gb memory for iMacs too to get to the 16gb maximum ram allowed for the new Apple i3, i5 and i7 iMac models.</p>

<p>Again you can check out the <strong>ram prices for new 1333Mhz Apple iMacs</strong> at the top of the page.</p>

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>MacBook RAM used to be expensive. Almost as much as the computer the ram was intended for if you can believe it. But, boy oh boy times have changed and now you can fill your MacBook with the maximum RAM for about the same price as a nice dinner out and you should skip the dinner and get the RAM.</p>

<p><strong>Different MacBook Memory Types</strong></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;">There’s essentially two different types of RAM for Macbook that could fit in your computer. If you have a new and  current MacBook, congrats as you have a very nice and cheap apple macbook and  it only makes sense to fill that sucker with RAM. As much memory as you can fit in, which at the time I write this is 4GB of RAM. To get an Apple computer or Apple Notebook that takes 8GB of memory you will need to get a MacBook Pro but today we’re all about the MacBooks which in my opinion offer the best bang for your shopping dollar. </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;">Where was I? Right, the newest MacBooks and anything from about 2008 and up take DDR3 1066 SDRAM dimms which are cheap cheap cheap right now and you buy enough ram to fill your macbook for under $100. Even a year ago this would have cost you much much more than that – closer to $500 for MacBook RAM. </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;">If you’ve got one of the first intel based MacBooks you probably need DDR2 PC5300 SDRAM and it’s pretty cheap too, in fact cheaper as these older Macbooks which came in both black and white configurations only could accept 2GB maximum, which is fine for web browsing or email or even some light photoshop or iMovie stuff too. Technically and according to Apple you can get 2GB max into these Macbook models but some of the later models would recognize 3gB of RAM which would require you to install a 2GB RAM for MacBook and a 1GB RAM for MacBook in the two slots.  This isn’t recommended by Apple, so I’m not going to suggest it either. You might be better off  just buying a new MacBook with a faster processor  if you need to use more than 2gb of RAM, or maybe even pick up the 13 inch MacBook Pro which will allow you even more RAM at 8GB </span></p>

    <h1><a href="/2010/08/highest-ram-prices/">Highest RAM Prices</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>I know when usually shopping for memory or RAM it’s natural to want to shop for the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="lowest price on ram">lowest price you can possibly find on memory upgrades</a> but it’s fun (to me anyway) to look at how much people will pay for memory and RAM.</p>

<p>Take <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/Mac_Pro_RAM_Upgrade_Kits_DDR3_1333_with_8GB_RAM-64gb/" title="mac pro 64gb ram">64GB for the Apple Mac Pros</a> for example. That’s a whole lot of ram for just one computer and you will pay for the the chance to fill your Mac Pro from Apple with RAM. You’ll pay dearly too. Almost $3000 for ram upgrades  and I think it’s the highest ram price I have ever listed here on ramseeker.</p>

<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-420" title="scientist" alt="" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/memorylady2.jpg" width="423" height="284" /></p>

<p>I’ve come close a few times and when those new iMacs were released a few years back the news sites  and the mac web in general were all a twitter about how much ram costs.  At the time to upgrade your iMac would cost you about $1000 which considering the iMac computer itself isn’t that much more money, it’s a lot to spend  on ram and  definitely the most money you could spend in the history of the Apple  iMac on Memory Upgrades.</p>

<p>But as I’ve seen over and over and over again – If you can wait  to upgrade your memory than maybe it’s not a bad idea. For some models, it’s probably best to just max out your ram now while you can. For <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_Pro_KITS_(1066_DDR3)/" title="macbook pro memory">MacBook Pro memory</a> and almost any PC notebook too that takes the DDR3 1066 ram you can fill the computer chock full of memory for under $250 and I suggest you do.</p>

<p>But a  good rule of thumb to follow is that if your ram upgrade costs $1000 or more, figure out if the cost of the ram upgrade can actually pay for itself. It’s one thing to drop $100 on ram so that facebook loads  a bit faster in your browser, but another when you have to spend  $1000 or more for memory for the same task.</p>

<p>But, if you’re making money with your comptuter it might be the best money you ever spent on ram upgrades if you will become  more efficient in your work due to the increase of ram in your computer. Even a three thousand dollar ram upgrade works out to $250 a month, which considered to other expenses for your business might be the biggest bargain ever – even if your ram upgrade is one of the highest ram prices currently available.</p>

<div style="float: right; margin-right: 5px;">
</div>

<p>I was asked this question today:</p>

<p><em>Jim, I am buying a MacBook Pro, should I get the 8GB ram upgrade and who should I buy the ram from? Should I Buy the RAM from the Apple Store?</em></p>

<p><em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1149" title="Cheapest MacBook Pro" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-24-at-7.39.14-AM1.png" alt="Best MacBook Pro Price" width="283" height="223" /></a></em></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I">Best Place To Buy a MacBook Pro</a></strong></p>

<p>There’s a few questions to answer there so let’s break this down into parts shall we?</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Congrats on the MacBook Pro.  It’s a powerful computer that will work for you for some time depending on your needs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yes, I suggest maxing out the MacBook Pro with as much RAM as you can and for the MBP’s that’s 8GB of RAM and you get there by either buying an 8GB RAM Kit for the MacBook Pro or you buy 2x4GB RAM Upgrades individually, but you will need two of them.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>And here’s why I think that you should <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="max out the ram macbook pro">max out the ram on the  MacBook Pro:</a> It’s a professional computer and you’re going to drop at least $1500 to buy the professional laptop computer but you’re on the fence about memory upgrades, which cost a fraction of what you spent on the  Apple notebook itself but will offer probably the best value for your computing dollar. As I write this, <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_Pro_KITS_(1066_DDR3)-8gb/" title="8GB for MacBook Pro">8GB for MacBook Pro</a> will set you back about $250 for you to max out your ram and get some work done that will pay the bills. I guess it’s the economy but you’ve just spent a good chunk of change on a notebook but you won’t upgrade the RAM?</p>

<ol>
  <li>Which brings us to the next question – where should you buy your MacBook Pro? The Apple Store is good but you’ll pay full load for it there. When pick up a<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26x%3D0%26ref_%3Dnb_sb_noss%26fsc%3D6%26ih%3D8_0_0_0_0_1_1_0_0_1.3_102%26y%3D0%26field-keywords%3Dmacbook%2520pro%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957" title="macbook pro deal"> MacBook Pro from Amazon </a>you can save a few percentage points and use the savings to buy more RAM. If you do buy your MacBook Pro from Apple, you might be able to save some money as you can order the MBP filled with RAM as a custom configuration but I’m warning you: Apple RAM is not the cheapest RAM you can buy. But do the math as you might be better off getting the RAM and Computer from the same store to save you money.  Take the ten minutes or so to shop around and get the best price on a MacBook Pro with 8GB of RAM, regardless of where you buy.</li>

<p>What is the <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="best macbook pro memory">Best MacBook Pro Memory</a></strong>?</p>

<p>This is just another question I get asked a whole lot and yet I’m reluctant to suggest any one particular store because then I would of course be showing a bias towards one computer memory reseller and  I don’t want to do that.</p>

<p>[table id=1 /]</p>

<p>But what I can tell those that are in the market for MacBook Pro Memory that any and all memory stores on ramseeker will gaurantee your memory upgrades so you can be sure that you’re not buying memory from a shady memory reseller and believe me, they’re out there.</p>

<p>[table id=15 /]</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I"><img title="Cheapest MacBook Pro" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-24-at-7.39.14-AM1.png" alt="Best MacBook Pro Price" width="283" height="223" /></a></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I">Best MacBook Pro Prices</a></strong></p>

<p>So what to look for when shopping for best MacBook Pro memory? Customer service is on the top of my list and I also dont’ mind paying a bit more for name brand too. But that’s my opinion only but if I have a choice between generic ram and name brand, I will chose the name brand ram every time even though you can buy generic ram cheaper.</p>

<p>There’s nothing wrong with generic ram and it is cheaper -whether for MacBook Pro or any other computer, the generic stuff is still tested and guaranteed to work from each and every store I list that sells <strong>MacBook Pro Memory</strong>. You can’t <strong>buy generic RAM</strong> from these stores and go wrong and that’s the reason I list the memory store’s prices.</p>

<p>I have never allowed any sneaky or shady prices on ramseeker to be posted, which unlike some other sites the price comparisons do match what is on the memory store’s site and it’s the price on ram you can expect to pay. No bait and switch or other questionable tactics are allowed.</p>

<p>I will tell you that I do  list and track MacBook Pro ram prices that are the lowest price as that’s why you’re here  – to compare prices on memory upgrades from reputable memory stores, and I hope you’re happy with my efforts. But to do so this usually means that to be competitive I’m tracking MacBook Pro generic RAM to get the best ram prices for you.</p>

<p>Sometimes I can do better and get you discounts on ram upgrades that are exclusive to ramseeker and you can’t find a better deal on MacBook Pro RAM from any other website. I  work hard to get you the best MacBook Pro RAM Prices  and that’s just one of the many Apple RAM upgrades I track. The special deals are already listed for you too. You do not need any memory upgrade coupon code. I have tried to offer you that in the past and it wasn’t worth the effort. It’s much easier and better for all parties to have a special ‘ramseeker price’ for RAM and list that price as the best price on RAM at the time.</p>

<p>If you are looking for the best price on Macbook Pro RAM you’re at at the right place.</p>

<p>Let me know if you need any help with your ram upgrades.</p>

<p>Do you need help with **buying memory **for your new or old computer? I’m happy to offer ram shopping help and you can always email me at jim at ramseeker.com. I don’t sell memory but I do and can recommend the right and correct memory upgrades for your computer regardless of what make it is or notebook or desktop computer.</p>

<p>Most memory stores do offer a memory configurator which is usually a pull down menu or some times it’s a list of links to popular or new memory upgrades that are popular for  most of the newer and modern computers as these are the most computers that can benefit from a ram upgrade.</p>

<p>The memory configurators are a good way to find out what RAM or Memory your computer needs but it gets confusing  as to what Memory you need. If you’re just an average computer user you don’t care about MHz or GHz or bus speeds or all the other technical  mumbo jumbo. All you want to do is to speed up your computer by using more ram and it will</p>

<p>Adding more ram is like moving into a bigger house. Instead of there being no room for your computer to work with, when you add ram it’s like now your computer has enough space to get things done and keep all the data organized and labeled and ready to use at a moment’s notice which is what ram does. stores stuff that the computer is going to need soon. It’s the technical equivalent of  “here hold this for a second”.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001KB6Z2U/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001KB6Z2U"><img title="Best RAM Prices" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-3.00.24-PM.png" alt="Cheapest RAM Prices" width="309" height="308" /></a></p>

<p>And there’s no reason why you shouldn’t upgrade your computer memory these days as ram is cheap and spending $100 on RAM is much better bang for buck for your computing dollar than say, spending it on a software update just because there’s a new version out, when the old software you have works just fine. (Windows Vista, anyone?)</p>

<p>But with RAM, unless you’re buying very large and very new technology – is pretty cheap. $100 for most notebooks gets you 4GB of memory which is what I recommend at a bare minimum for computing in 2010.</p>

<p>Again, I don’t sell RAM. I just like to shop for RAM and help you get the best price from a fair and reputable memory store on your memory upgrades, that’s it.</p>

<p>If you do need help when <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="shopping for ram">shopping for ram </a>or memory don’t hestitate to contact me if you can’t figure out what type or size of RAM your computer needs. I’m here to help you.</p>

<p>Now that it’s 2012,  it’s pretty easy to say that the minimum memory for today’s Apple Macintosh computers when it comes to <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="mac memory">Mac Memory</a> is 4GB of RAM. I could be wrong but I know the new MacBooks ship with 2gb of RAM standard and I’m pretty sure that the Mac Mini’s do too and the MacBook Pros start at 4gb of RAM and the Mac Pros can be filled with 64gb of ram if you’ve got deep enough pockets.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001265GI2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001265GI2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1300" title="Cheap 4GB Mac RAM" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-3.03.21-PM.png" alt="Cheap RAM for Macs 4GB" width="272" height="313" /></a></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001265GI2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001265GI2">Cheap 4GB RAM for Mac</a></strong></p>

<p>All this to say if you’re shopping for a memory upgrade for a new MacBook or Macbook Pro or, yes even Mac Mini – that you should have your sights on at very least 4GB of RAM for these Macs.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/iMac_KITS_(DDR3_1333)/" title="imac 16gb ram kits">The iMac will accept up to 16gb of RAM</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/Mac_Mini_KITS_(1066_DDR3)/" title="Mac mini memory upgrade kits">The Mac Mini will accept up to 8GB of RAM </a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_KITS_(1066_DDR3)/" title="macbook memory kits 4gb">The MacBooks will accept up to 4GB of RAM </a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_Pro_KITS_(1066_DDR3)/" title="macbook pro ram kits">The MacBook Pros will take up to 8GB</a> *(and  my guess is 16gb for MacBook Pros at next refresh). *</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/Mac_Pro_RAM_Upgrade_Kits_DDR3_1333_with_8GB_RAM/" title="Mac Pros 64gb memory">The Mac Pros will take up to 64GB. </a></p>

<p>But with it being back to school season, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26x%3D0%26ref_%3Dnb_sb_noss%26fsc%3D4%26ih%3D4_1_1_1_0_0_1_0_0_2.7_96%26y%3D0%26field-keywords%3Dmacbook%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957" title="buying a macbook">buying a MacBook</a> is going to be a popular activity over the next month or thereabouts so I want to talk about MacBook Memory as this is probably the  one computer form Apple that could really benefit from a 4gb Mac Memory Upgrade.</p>

<p>At 2gb stanard, Apple had to cut corners somewhere to get the MacBook to the Magical $999 price so they tossed 2x1Gb chips in it and said good enough..  (which I think is still a lot for what it is, but that’s a topic for another day). 4gb for MacBook  will turn your MB into a much more useable machine and 4gb is no money these days and the result of hte macbook ram upgrade will be making it more capable and it doesn’t matter what you’re doing with it surfing, email and so on will run faster and smoother with more memory for your portable mac.</p>

<p>If you’re running a Mac with 2GB or less and it’s a newer modern machine you should stop what you’re doing right now and see if you can get 4gb of RAM into your Mac somehow.</p>

<p>If you can’t add 4GB of RAM you might be better off buying a new Mac that allows 4gb.</p>

<p>4GB of RAM for all Macs released in 2010 should be the minimum amount in my opinion.</p>

<p>Installing Memory in a MacBook Pro (or macbook) is pretty easy and can be don by the average computer user without any special tools or know-how.</p>

<p>First, you need to buy new macbook pro RAM  to install (see current prices on MacBook Pro Memory above) and replace the standard MacBook Pro memory that came installed with your computer in the first place. **Add as much macbook pro ram as you can afford. **You can never never go wrong when shopping for macbook pro ram when you buy ram from my list of authorized <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="macbook pro stores">macbook pro stores</a>. Brand can matter for some people when it comes to shopping for MacBook Pro RAM as there’s a small chance that the brand name stuff will work a bit better  in your MacBook Pro as usually it’s been tested and guaranteed to work. Generic MacBook Pro RAM works just fine too but you might be buying a wee bit more peace of mind when you buy the name brand ram. The cheapest RAM may or may not be the the best price on MacBook Pro RAM.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I"><img title="Cheapest Apple MacBook Pro" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-3.05.45-PM.png" alt="Best MacBook Pro Prices" width="294" height="209" /></a></p>

<p>[table id=1 /]</p>

<p>Once you have the RAM in your hand, you might want to invest in an anti-static wrist band. Sometimes you can buy the anti-static wrist band at the same time as you buy the MacBook Pro RAM, but  sometimes you’ll have to go elsewhere to buy an antistatic wrist band for installing memory. Your local computer store can usually help you.</p>

<p>You don’t NEED an antistatic wrist band if you’re sure to discharge any static electricity you have on you by touching  the metal casing of  your macbook pro first to discharge any static before you install the macbook pro ram. Also, it’s probably not a good idea to wear wool sweaters on a dry winter day or rub balloons on your head just before you install the macbook pro memory.  Be sure to discharge any static electricity before you go about installing RAM yourself. RAM is very particular and can be damaged by static electricity. When you bought it, you should have received it in an anti-static bag and sometimes there’s a big warning sticker on the bag that you have to break before you can access the ram and it says the same thing I’ve been saying: <strong>static electricity is bad for ram</strong></p>

<p>Once you’re all set to go then all you do is  remove the battery of your macbook pro, take  of the bottom part, or sometimes even then entire bottom. You might need a very small philips screwdriver or sometimes a specific torx screwdriver to do this. On my MacBook Pro, to add more ram once I had the cover off, I had to unplug and remove the MacBook Pro hard drive before I could access the RAM slots.</p>

<p>Once there, there’s two slots for MacBook Pro RAM and to remove the old MacBook Pro memory there’s two tabs that hold down the ram and when I did this the memory popped up to a 45 degree angle  which allowed me take hold of the memory (watch that static!) and with a slight pull I removed the memory. I did the same thing when removing the ram from the second memory slot and in no time I was ready to install my new MacBook Pro RAM.</p>

<p>For the actual installation of memory on my MacBook Pro all I did was the reverse. You slip the memory in at about a 45 degree angle into the slots and seat the memory into the slot. It’s a tight fit sometimes so don’t be afraid to use some gentle pressure. Push down on the RAM once it’s seated and the two little tabs click in to lock the memory down into the macbook pro’s memory slots. Repeat for the second memory slot in the MacBook Pro and you can’t go wrong really. The RAM has a little notch in it so you can’t install the memory backwards or upside down. The RAM only fits into the slot one way.</p>

<p>When you have your MacBook Pro ram installed,  all you do is replace what you removed to get at the memory upgrades slots. replace the hard drive, screw the cover or bottom of the MacBook Pro back on and replace the MacBook Pro Battery.  Press the power button and your MacBook Pro should start up without any trouble and now the MacBook Pro will run faster too and allow you to get your work done quicker.</p>

<p>Apple has excellent instructions on <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="how to install macbook pro ram">how to install MacBook Pro RAM </a> and you can find them by <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1270" title="install macbook pro ram">clicking here</a>. They’ve got instructions for a whole range of MacBook Pros so I suggest you refer to their instructions before installing MacBook Pro memory on your own.</p>

<p><strong>Where to Buy 8GB of RAM</strong></p>

<p>If you’re shopping online for 8GB of RAM there are loads of memory shops, stores,vendors whatever you wan to call them that will be more than happy to sell you 8GB of RAM.</p>

<p>But you should do your homework first. You might think it’s the best idea to shop for the lowest priced RAM but sometimes, not always – this is not the best way to buy ram as yes, price is king for RAM or anything else but memory is pretty advanced stuff. It’s not like  you’re buying a cup of coffee here. You’re buying what was once thought of impossible:8GB of memory for a very competitive price regardless of you who you end up buying RAM from and it wouldn’t hurt you to do some smart shopping and buy RAM from someobody who knows the business and what RAM you need for your computer.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW"><img title="Best Price 8GB MacBook Pro" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-3.09.11-PM.png" alt="Cheapest MacBook Pro 8GB" width="309" height="214" /></a></strong></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW">8GB MacBook Pro RAM</a></strong></p>

<p> </p>

<p>There are thousands and thousands of different computer models out there and each and every one  of them could benefit from a memory upgrade but some won’t even accept the 8GB  memory so that’s the first thing you need to know: How much RAM can your computer handle?</p>

<p>Next, will your OS recognize  the RAM. If you’re running an older version of windows or even the latest windows 7 be sure to check and be sure you can use and benefit from an 8GB RAM upgrade as you’re just throwing your money away if your computer won’t acknowledge the memory upgrade in the first place.</p>

<p>Once you’ve got those two things solved, you need to decide on  what’s important to you when shopping for RAM. Are you on a budget and the only way  you can  upgrade your memory is if you buy the cheapest RAM, or do you have a few more dollars to spend on brand name ram vs generic ram. Brand name RAM might be no better than generic, but for some it’s important to know that their memory came from a specific supplier as opposed to some that are nothing more than ram resellers.</p>

<p>How about customer service?  If you’re a programmer or IT specialist or even just an advanced hobbyist than you probably know your way around a memory upgrade and you probably have a favorite place to buy ram already and don’t care about customer service.</p>

<p>But if you’re new to computers and wouldn’t mind a bit of help with the memory upgrades both in the pre-sale and after sale  support you might be better off buying your 8GB RAM from somebody who offers the support you need.</p>

<p>Now that we have all our options and preferences when it comes to buying ram online (or even in store) we can go shopping for 8GB RAM. I suggest you buy 8GB of RAM from the following memory vendors:</p>

<p>Crucial Technology</p>

<p>18004Memory</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memoryx">Memory X </a></p>

<p>OEMPCWORLD</p>

<p>RAMJET</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memorytogo">Memory To Go </a></p>

<p>Other World Computing</p>

<p>These memory suppliers, or stores have been in business for over ten years, some closer to twenty and all will support you both in offering the best price on 8GB of RAM regardless of whether you are shopping for ram for Apple, Dell, HP or Sony Computers to name a few, the above listed memory sellers will help you get the right 8GB ram for the best price.</p>

<p>Good luck shopping for<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="8GB RAM Memory"> 8GB of RAM Memory</a></p>
