<p>Almost all memory stores online offer something that’s called a memory configurator which  is  really just a way to search for  the correct ram upgrade for your Mac. You do need to be aware that some memory stores sell memory upgrades for Apple by individual memory chip, while others market their memory upgrades a bit better and sell memory upgrade kits, something that in 2011 is required as I recommend you buy RAM in matched pairs regardless of whether it’s technically required or not.  With the fact that RAM is the cheapest it’s been, well, ever  – it makes no sense to me not to buy RAM that matches.The <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/" title="Best Mac Memory">Best Mac Memory</a> is sold by so many memory stores it’s hard to keep track of <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/where-to-buy-computer-memory-upgrades/" title="where to buy mac ram">memory stores</a>, let alone where to get the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="cheap ram">best memory prices</a> (I’ll come back to that in a minute or two) but first we need to determine what Apple Mac you specifically need to upgrade with RAM, as all memory does not work or is compatible with all Apple computers in 2011 so it’s a good idea to figure out what memory  you need to buy.<br />
**Cheapest Apple iMac<br />
**<br />
The Apple iMac comes in four different models: two Apple iMacs offer 21 inch LCD displays, while the other 2 feature 27 inch displays.  On the 21 inch iMac, processor speeds can start at 3.06GHz Intel Core i3, and then work upwards to 3.2GGzh and  3.2GHz Intel Core i3 while the 27 inch iMacs offer processor speeds of 3.2 GHz Intel Core i3 and lastly a quad core 2.8GHz Intel Core i5 processor being the fastest iMac you can buy today.</p>

<p>But regardless of what specific Apple iMac you choose to buy, they all require the same memory upgrades: 1333GHz DDR3 SDRAM so-dimms are on sale at the lowest prices from a variety of online memory stores and the best iMac RAM Prices are here:</p>

**<br />
The Apple Mac Mini only ships in one model, (well, OK, there’s the Mac Mini Server) but for the rest of us that want to upgrade the cheapest co<br />
mputer Apple sells than the standard Mac Mini, it is. The Mac Mini requires slower RAM than the Apple iMac and uses DDR3 1066 SDRAM so-dimms available from a variety of vendors, but again it’s recommended to buy Mac Min RAM in matched pairs by me. Mac Mini RAM is so cheap it’s not advisable to mix and match RAM for the Mac Mini and suffer the performance problems that may occur as a result. The Apple Mac Mini only ships with a mere 2GB of RAM, so an upgrade to 8GB for Mac Mini is recommended</p>

<p>**<a>Cheapest Apple MacBook</a><br />
**<br />
The MacBook from Apple is limited to only one MacBook model on sale currently- the 2.4GHz MacBook Intel Core 2 Duo, which ships with 2GB of RAM installed in the two MacBook memory upgrade slots available. The maximum MacBook RAM allowed on the 2011 MacBook is 4GB of RAM, which means you can, and I suggest you do, double your MacBook RAM. Like the other Mac models, I do suggest you replace the RAM in pairs, although technically you don’t have to, there’s very little performance increase in 3GB of RAM over 2 GB so you are much better off with upgrading all the way to 4GB of RAM for MacBook Pro.</p>

<p>MacBook Pro RAM is super cheap for DDR3 SDRAM 1066 so-dimms, the RAM you need to buy for the MacBook so even if you’re remotely considering a MacBook Upgrade, I suggest you do it.</p>

The Mac Pro comes in a selection of processor speeds, Quad Core 2.8GHz Quad Core Intel Xeon Processor, 8 Core with two Quad Core Intel Xeon Processors and 12 core with two six core Intel Processors and depending on the model of Mac Pro you have, requires either DDR3 1066 SDRAM DIMMS or DDR3 1333 SDRAM DIMMS, with the dual processor Mac Pro systems using the slower DDR3 1066 SDRAM and the 2.66Mhz and 2.93Mhz Mac Pros running the faster RAM at 1333Mhz.</p>

		<div class="post-content"><div style="float: right; margin-right: 5px;">

<div style="float: right; margin-right: 5px;">
</div>

<p>Wow.</p>

<p>This is some question and the two computers could not be any different if you tried. First, we’ve got the whole <strong>Mac vs. PC thing</strong> going on which I won’t get into as we all have our biases and for some it’s the initial or out of the box price that has to be lowest and yet other customers prefer to pay a bit more at the store for reduced headaches down the road.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8IO6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8IO6">Cheapest Apple iMac</a></strong></p>

<p>Then we’ve got the fact that the Apple iMac is a best selling desktop computer regardless of brand, and the fact that the HP ENVY 14 is not but is a very capable notebook computer that’s feature packed with all kinds of goodies such as Windows OS, Intel Core i5-480M Processor 2.66GHz with Turbo Boost Technology up to 2.93 GHz, 4GB DDR3 System Memory (2 DIMM) and a maximum of 8GB of HP Envy RAM and a 14.5 inch LCD display rounding out the main feature set of the HP 14. Street price is $999, but you can get a HP Envy 14 deal that’s less than that considerably (<strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8IO6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8IO6">see cheapest HP ENVY 14 price</a></strong>). One of the major advantages of the HP ENVY 14 is that you can take this computer with you thanks to the notebook design.</p>

<p>On the iMac side of things there’s the fact that the iMac, even the <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/">cheapest iMac you can buy</a></strong> – features a 21.5 inch LCD display for far more screen real estate than the 14 inch display on the HP ENVY. The downside being of course, whether you need portability as the Apple iMac, even though thanks to it’s all in one design could be considered portable, really isn’t. As far as specs, the iMac of course ships with the Mac OS so there’s that, but the the iMac uses a 3.06GHz Intel Core i3 processor and ships with 4GB of RAM, but can be expanded to 16GB of iMac memory. The list price on the Apple iMac is $1199, another $200 more than the HP ENV too. (<strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8IO6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8IO6">see cheapest iMac Price</a></strong>)</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8IO6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8IO6">Best Price on HP ENVY 14</a></strong></p>

<p>So as I see it, to decide whether to <strong>buy the HP ENVY 14 or the Apple iMac</strong> comes down to this:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Price</strong>. The iMac costs more.</li>
  <li><strong>Use</strong>. The HP envy is a notebook and the iMac isn’t.</li>
  <li><strong>OS</strong>. We won’t even go there.</li>
  <li><strong>Screen Size</strong>. The iMac wins.</li>
  <li><strong>Processor</strong>. The Envy offers a faster processor, but at a lower speed. This could be close in real world testing.</li>
</ol>

<p>The big variable when <strong>comparing the Apple iMac to the HP Envy 14</strong> is use, first and foremost. Forget, all the other variables such as the Mac and Windows, or even price and concentrate on what, and where you plan on using your computer. If you need to be out and about, the <strong>HP ENVY</strong> wins thanks to it’s portable notebook design, but if you need <strong>bigger screen real estate</strong>, and can live with an all in one desktop design the <strong>Apple iMac might be a better fit</strong></p>

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>It should come as no surprise that the first upgrade I am going to recommend you do is to <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">upgrade memory on your MacBook</a></strong>, as MacBook memory is so cheap, you can max out the ram on your MacBook for under $100, in fact – way less than that with a <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_KITS_(1066_DDR3)-4gb/" title="MacBook 4GB RAM Kits">4GB RAM Memory kit for Apple MacBooks</a> costing you <strong>less than $50.00 for 2×2 GB DDR3 SDRAM 1066 SDRAM sodimms</strong>. This total gets cheaper too if you sell your older or factory MacBook RAM that you pulled from your MacBook to make room for the newer, bigger, 2GB MacBook RAM chips. <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/ramjet">RAMJET</a>, <a href="http://www.macsales.com">OWC</a> and <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/oempcworld">OEMPCWORLD</a> are just a few memory stores that will <strong>buy back your old MacBook RAM</strong>.</p>

<p>Installing the RAM upgrade on your MacBook is easy too. Flip the MacBook over on it’s backside, remove the cover and battery, make sure you are well grounded as we don’t want to have any accidents when it comes to static electricity as the RAM memory you bought for your new MacBook, while cheap – doe not like static electricity at all. If you’re concerned about installing MacBook RAM yourself, just take the RAM and MacBook to an authorized apple dealer so you don’t void the warranty on you MacBook and for a fee, you can get the RAM installed without having to worry about static electricity. But I don’t think you need to take your MacBook in to get serviced and you can do it yourself. Just don’t wear a wool sweater with wool socks on a shag carpet  on the coldest day of winter to upgrade the MacBook RAM. Touch the MacBook’s metal parts such as the MacBook chassis and you’ll be fine as any static electricity you’ve been keeping will discharge. If you’re all concerned about upgrading the RAM on your MacBook, don’t be. Apple even says it’s OK for you to upgrade your own MacBook RAM and provides you with <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1651#link1">easy to use and follow instructions to do so</a>.  The result will be an upgraded MacBook running twice the factory installed 2GB of MacBook Memory.</p>

<p><strong>Warranty</strong></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004R6J2V6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004R6J2V6">MacBook  AppleCare Plan</a></strong></p>

<p><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">MacBooks come out of the box with a one year warranty, so unless you do something silly like, oh, drop the MacBook or spill coke all over the MacBook there’s a little chance you will need an extended warranty, right? But for the rest of us that use the MacBook like the small, durable portable it was designed to be and actually go outside with the MacBook and take it to school, office or your local starbucks it’s no a bad idea to buy AppleCare from Apple that offers extended warranty. You’re still hosed if you drop or spill on your MacBook as Apple did not design their consumer notebook to suffer that fate, but for the stuff that is considered a manufacturer’s defect wouldn’t you like to know you’re covered for longer than the original year that Apple includes for free with every $999 MacBook. </span></strong></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004R6J2V6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=rasmeeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004R6J2V6">AppleCare</a></strong> is a great deal and for just pennies a day, you’re insured for 3 years on both limited warranty, and the telephone support for your MacBook too. Out of the box, the MacBook only comes with 90 days support, but AppleCare gives you 3 years. The warranty allows you to take in your MacBook to any Authorized Dealer or Repair Center and applies not only to  the MacBook, but all the accessories too such as power adapters, RAM (this assumes your factory memory) and even the Apple Display if you bought it too at the same time as your MacBook.</p>

<p>All this is just $250 for two more years of limited warranty coverage from Apple and two years and 9 months of free MacBook telephone support compared to just the 90 days. The $250 price works out to another $125/year for the additional warranty coverage or ten dollars a month for MacBook to be covered in full for the three years. LCD displays are expensive. So are motherboards on your MacBook that might heat up and decide, nope  it’s not going to work anymore.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004R6J2V6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=rasmeeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004R6J2V6">AppleCare is a good deal</a></strong> if  you plan on keeping the MacBook longer than a year.</p>

<p><strong>Hard Drives</strong></p>

<p>For a lot of us, this might not be an issue and the 250GB storage space the MacBook ships with will be more than enough for school papers, recipes, MP3’s or photos and audio files, but in 2011 there’s two ways that you could upgrade your MacBook with either a bigger hard drive, or much faster hard drive depending on what you use the MacBook for.</p>

<p>Hard Drive upgrades are available  from a variety of hard drive manufacturers and at very least you would want to double or even quadruple the hard drive space on the MacBook. The MacBook uses 2.5 inch  SATA notebook hard drives that on the Macbook are easy to replace or upgrade. At the time  I write this, <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001JSSDGU/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001JSSDGU">500GB notebook drives</a></strong> are available for about $50, and <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001JSSDGU/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001JSSDGU">1TB hard drives</a></strong> for MacBook run about $100 or so</p>

<p><strong>External MacBook Hard Drives</strong></p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018B5CA8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0018B5CA8">Lacie 500GB and 1TB External Hard Drives</a></strong></p>

<p>Of course, there’s also external storage for the MacBook, which is a great solution for backups or just when you need more storage than what the MacBook offers internally but don’t need to keep all the  files on the  MacBook at the same time. A Seagate 1tB external hard drive for MacBook costs just under $100 and if you’re in the market for a pocket hard drive for the MacBook then you might want to consider the <strong><a href="://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018B5CA8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0018B5CA8">Lacie all terrain rugged pocket hard drives</a></strong> that are smaller and easily fit into your MacBook case or bag and are available in both 500GB  and 1TB sizes.</p>

<p><strong>SSD Hard Drives</strong></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0039SM0B2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0039SM0B2">Crucial 256GB SSD Hard Drive</a></strong></p>

<p>Both of these hard drives are the standard platter type hard drive which work similar to a turntable might, and the data is read off of  platters that spin and the arm on the drive seeks for the data the MacBook requires at the  time.  The advantage of these drives is that the technology has pretty much been the same for years now, and the costs for hard drive space in 2011 are pretty cheap as  $100 gets you a whole whack of storage space.  **But there’s a new hard drive technology in town called SSD hard drives **which are solid state hard drives that feature no moving parts and are substantially faster than a standard hard drive could be, thanks to zero seek and read times, the data on the SSD hard drives are available much faster than standard drives resulting in no wait time and much faster startup times on the MacBooks.</p>

<p>The disadvantage of SSD hard drives for  MacBook is the price. As this technology is still relatively new, maximum sizes are limited to about <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0039SM0B2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0039SM0B2">250GB SSD Hard drives</a> and the price is much higher with street prices of about $500 common. SSD Hard drives for MacBooks are still  an upgrade to consider  thanks to the increased  performance. You could use the factory MacBook hard drive as an external hard drive with the addition of a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AAVA08/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001AAVA08">USB or Firewire external enclosure</a> but the SSD hard drives are still a bit pricey still when compared to more traditional hard drive solutions.</p>

<p><strong>MacBook Software</strong></p>

<p>The Apple MacBook ships from Apple with some very powerful software right out of the box with iMovie, iTunes and the iLife software suite included with each MacBook today. But there are times when you need to get more done with your MacBook than what’s included with the MacBook out of the box.</p>

<p>Microsoft can make some pretty questionable products and it’s my opinion that as good as Windows 7 is, the Mac OS still reigns supreme, but despite that fact, if you write a document, make a presentation, work with numbers or any other numerable tasks that require you to work and share with your Mac and PC friends in a format that is easy to open and read and free of headaches, then you do need to buy Microsoft software for your home office and school needs as it’s been that way for years, and despite the fact Apple has iWork, Office for Mac is the leader when it comes to Apple productivity software.</p>

<p>One of the best things about the Apple MacBook  is that you can work all day with Microsoft Office, and then with about $50 worth of software, the MacBook becomes the ultimate gaming machine, something Apple really hasn’t paid attention to. (Mind you, they’ve got the smartphone and MP3 player market pretty much wrapped up)</p>

<p>Anyway, this version of the popular simulation gaming franchise features a living world of Sims featuring romance, drama, and enhanced  lighting and special effects. This game is more popular than Microsoft Office so if Apple Gaming is your thing, be sure to pick up this latest Sims Game.</p>

<p>Do yourself a favor and shell out  the forty bucks or so  that Quicken costs and get your finances in shape today. This software does so much when it comes to managing your  money,  I simply cannot imagine owning a Mac without it. Too many features to list really with this personal finance money management software, but a few and most important is that Quicken can show you where to save more and spend less. This software should be a requirement  as standard equipment on every Mac, not just the MacBook.</p>

<p><strong>NoteBook Cases</strong></p>

<p>Unless for some reason you bought your MacBook with the intent of plugging it in at your desk and leaving  it there, there will come a time when you want to take your MacBook with you, and you’ll need  a case, bag, backpack  – whatever name you want to call it to carry your MacBook in something that’s both fashionable and will protect your MacBook form the bumps and grinds of daily life.</p>

<p>Notebook bags tend to be a personal decision  and I think that the decision is up to you as a lot depends on how you use your Mac notebook for everyday use as well as style and type of notebook case such as messenger bags or  backpacks for notebooks or even notebook sleeves made of neoprene might be what you’re after. But here’s a few good deals on MacBook bags, cases, whatever you want to call ’em.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003D0SH5O/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B003D0SH5O">Sharper Image TSA Computer Case</a></strong></p>

<p>This looks to be a pretty good case, and offers a nice look, lots of room (will hold a 17 inch MacBook Pro too) and a padded computer compartment that allows for easy removal for TSA scanning on airports. The fact that this notebook case  is on sale at over 60% off doesn’t hurt too.  One of the best notebook cases available today.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>I doubt you guys will like this one much, as it looks a little too purse-y, but for you ladies sick of slugging around a standard looking laptop case, this tote fits up to a 15 inch notebook, which is lots of room for the MacBook and even some MacBook Pro’s. Inside, there’s not only room for the MacBook but pen and pencil loops and an internal zippered pocket too , great for  power adapters and  the like.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>With this messenger bag from the Sharper Image, I have listed every different type of notebook bag for MacBook available and this particular mdoel should appeal to both sexes thanks to it’s over the shoulder, rest on the  hip design. Able to carry notebooks up to 15.6 inches, this notebook bag can hold MacBooks, but also windows notebooks too with ease. Lots of pockets make this an excellent choice for  a stylish notebook bag on sale.</p>

<p>The Cheapest RAM for Apple iMacs can be found here for [4GB DDR3 1333MHz sodimms][1], which is the type of RAM you will need for the 2010 Apple iMacs. The Apple iMacs released in the summer of 2010 can accept up to [16GB of RAM][2] and by filling the four available memory upgrade slots with 4x4GB DDR sodimms for Apple iMac you will enjoy faster iMac, and an Apple desktop computer that will be able to open more applications at the same time too – allowing you to get more done faster</p>

<p><span style="text-align: left;">There’s rumor of a 2011 iMac in April, and it wouldn’t surprise me, as the iMac is Apple’s consumer based desktop computer and the release of the new Apple iMacs would be in time for both the back to school shopping season as well as the Christmas shopping season for for 2011.</span></p>

  <p style="text-align: left;">
    <strong>Where to find the Cheapest 2010 iMac RAM<br /> </strong><br /> I&#8217;ve already mentioned the type of RAM you need to buy to fill your Apple iMac with memory, and the next question is where to buy RAM for iMac for less? I&#8217;m a fan of, <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">Crucial</a>, <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/OWC">OWC</a> and <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/1800">1-800-4-Memory </a>to name a few of the best memory stores, with OWC being the only online store dedicated entirely to apple upgrades, they might be your best bet if you need advice on what specific RAM you need to buy for the latest iMacs, but the other memory stores should be able to help you out too as they not only carry memory for Apple, but also other PC manufacturers such as Dell, Sony, HP etc.
  </p>
  
  <p style="text-align: left;">
    One other factor to determine when shopping for the cheapest iMac memory you can buy is support, after or before you buy. Of the few memory stores I listed above, just one actually offers name brand and in most cases is not the cheapest RAM as the Crucial memory is name brand RAM made by Micron, whereas for the most part, all the other stores offer two types of RAM for iMacs, both name brand and generic but the generic stuff is what gets quoted when shopping for Apple iMac RAM and the lowest price is the most important buying decision.
  </p>
  
  <p style="text-align: left;">
    Whatever way you choose to go, whether that means buying RAM from Amazon or Best Buy, or you select the few memory stores I recommend you will do much, much, better on price for 2010 iMac memory if you stay away from the Apple Store. Apple&#8217;s stores are great when you physcially need to see or touch the Apple product before you buy it, but for memory products this is really not needed, and there&#8217;s a very good chance Apple will supply you with Micron or Samsung memory upgrades anyway, so you&#8217;re better to shop online for iMac RAM for considerable savings.

<p>What is the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com">best iMac RAM</a> and where can buy RAM for iMacs the cheapest? This is one question I answer multiple times daily.</p>

<p>In this case, we’re looking to upgrade the memory on the <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00361EZX8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00361EZX8">Apple iMac 27 inch 3.2Ghz</a></strong>, which is a summer <strong>2010 Apple iMac</strong>, and at the time one of the biggest and fastest Apple iMacs you can buy today, so it makes absolutely perfect sense to upgrade the RAM on this Apple iMac model to maximize the performance of this iMac which is still a current model in 2011.<br />
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00361EZX8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00361EZX8"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1107" title="Cheapest Apple iMac" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-22-at-4.10.30-PM1.png" alt="Best Price Apple iMac" width="288" height="286" /></a></p>

<p>The <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00361EZX8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00361EZX8">iMac 27 inch 3.2Ghz</a></strong> features an Intel i3 dual core processor (with a nickname of clarkdale) and out of the box from Apple ships with just 4GB of RAM installed, so there’s plenty of room for RAM upgrades with this big screen high speed iMac. All 2010 Apple iMac models, including this one can accept 16GB of RAM, allowing you to effectively quadruple the memory upgrades on the iMac models released earlier last year in 2010.</p>

<p>As you can see from the <strong>Apple iMac RAM Prices</strong> above, RAM upgrades for the Apple iMac are pretty cheap and you can upgrade the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00361EZX8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00361EZX8">3.2Ghz Apple iMac</a> to the maximum RAM allowed of 16GB for under $100 now. RAM for iMacs wasn’t always this cheap and just a few short years ago 8GB of RAM for iMacs would have set you back more than the Apple iMac itself with a $1000 price tag for 8GB of iMac RAM.</p>

<p>But the good news is technology marches on and prices get cheaper, and now that 16GB RAM for iMacs have been around for a while it makes no sense to me why you wouldn’t want to upgrade any iMac RAM to the maximum allowed.</p>

<p>**How To Upgrade <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00361EZX8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00361EZX8">iMac 27 inch 3.2Ghz</a><br />
**<br />
Once you have bought the RAM for iMac 27 inch 3.2GHz, it’s really easy to install the ram yourself, and <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1423#1">Apple even provides instructions on how to do so </a> which as you can see is pretty easy. Place the iMac face down, raise the stand, remove the door covering the memory slots and you will have easy access to the four iMac memory upgrade slots for memory upgrade installation.</p>

<p>This particular Apple iMac model (this applies to all 2010 iMacs) require <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/iMac_(DDR3_1333)/">DDR3 1333Mhz SDRAM sodimms</a>. To get to the maximum of 16GB of RAM for Apple iMacs you will have to remove the factory installed iMac RAM (which you can trade in at time of purchase. <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/OWC">OWC</a> is just one vendor who will buy back your Apple RAM, saving you even more money on your total iMac upgrade) and replace it with 4x 4GB DDR3 SDRAM sodimms. Some memory stores also sell iMac memory in upgrade kits – more for marketing than anything else, but you should check both <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/iMac_KITS_(DDR3_1333)-16gb/">16GB DDR3 RAM kits</a> and <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/iMac_(DDR3_1333)-4gb/">4GB DDR3 RAM modules for Apple iMacs</a> if you want to get the very best deal on Apple desktop computer memory.</p>

<p>**Best RAM for IMac 3.2GHz 27 inch<br />
**</p>

<p>I’m always reluctant to recommend any one vendor because there’s so many different variables when it comes to choosing the best RAM for you and your iMac. If you’re interested in price only, then the table above shows you the <strong>lowest iMac RAM prices available right now</strong>, but don’t forget about other variables too, such as free shipping on RAM, shipping times, trade in allowances if applicable and the speed you need the RAM delivered. Then we get to the generic RAM vs name brand RAM. Most memory stores offer you a choice when shopping for RAM: You can buy the cheapest RAM, which is usually generic memory or name brand RAM from Samsung or Kingston or Crucial RAM. With the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">crucial</a> RAM, you get a name brand, but you’ll pay more for it and the price premium may or may not be worth the price when it comes to choosing the best RAM – iMac or otherwise. I can tell you that if you buy RAM from any of the memory stores I list here you’ll be buying memory from a reputable memory seller who happily will support the same both pre-sale and post sale in the rare event you have any problems with your iMac RAM.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2011/03/how-much-memory-will-a-macbook-pro-recognize/">How Much Memory Will A MacBook Pro Recognize?</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>Memory upgrades for the Apple MacBook Pro now ship in three different ram types for the MacBook Pro and depending on the specific Apple Mac Pro you have and are wanting to or needing to add ram upgrades to  – the answer will be different. The short answer  to your question **How Much Memory Will a MacBook Pro Recognize? **is that it depends on what Apple MacBook Pro you are needing to max out with Apple memory.</p>

<p><strong>PC2 5300 DDR2 MacBook Pro RAM Upgrades</strong></p>

<p>MacBook Pro RAM over the years has shipped in various speeds and memory sizes with the first MacBook Pros only being able to recognize 2GB of RAM. I’m not going to list all the different MacBook Pro models that maxed out at 2GB, but let’s say if your MacBook Pro is 3 years old or  older there’s a good chance that the MacBook Pro 2GB maximum Applied.</p>

<p><strong>PC3 1066 DDR3 MacBook Pro RAM Upgrades</strong></p>

<p>Then in oh, about  2008 the MacBook Pros made out of aluminum showed up on the scene and with the faster processors, these MBP’s also required different RAM than the older MacBook Pro models did as DDR3 1066 SDRAM sodimms became the standard memory upgrades for the MacBook Pro  and with them came the ability to accept 4GB of RAM –  a big bump as now the MacBook Pros could accept 4GB of RAM in the form of 2x2gB memory upgrade modules.  In 2009, the MacBook Pros could accept 8GB of RAM which was really a a big deal, but so was the price – when you could first install 8GB into a MacBook Pro, the cost was almost one thousand dollars, which was the same as or close to the cost of the MacBook  Pro. Thankfully  ram prices for MacBook Pros  have dropped considerably and for most MBP’s that will accept 8GB of RAM you can now max out your MacBook Pro for under $100 from most memory vendors.</p>

<p><strong>PC3 1333 DDR3 MacBook Pro RAM Upgrades</strong></p>

<p>In 2011, – last month to be exact – Apple has released the latest and best MacBook Pros to date with faster processors, longer battery life and… <strong>the same 8GB of RAM</strong> as the previous models. This is a disappointment  as the rumor sites were sure we’d  see the latest MacBook Pros to support 16GB of RAM. But last week, OWC announced that they have tested and  approved for sale 16GB RAM for MacBook Pro models  in 2011. But these are the <strong>most expensive ram upgrades for MacBook Pro</strong> I have ever seen and at the time I write this will cost you more than the MacBook Pro you will want to ugprade.</p>

<p>[table id=15 /]</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="buying macbook RAM">Buying MacBook Pro RAM</a></strong></p>

<p>Once you have determined what MacBook Pro you have, which can be tricky –  but one way is to just go to the apple menu  and  select about this Mac, which at very least will show you what kind or speed of RAM you need which helps you narrow down the above 3 choices for MacBook Pro RAM  from 3 different ram types to three.  An example would be in my case, I’m typing this on a 2008 Apple MacBook Pro which shows I have the maximum  4GB of MacBook RAM installed:</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  As you can see, my particular Apple MacBook Model uses 1066MHz RAM. The system runs the DDR3 1066MHz RAM at 1066.6 MHz, and thus the memory speed is reported as 1067MHz, instead of 1066MHz, but make no mistake you need to buy DDR3 SDRAM RAM upgrades if your MacBook reads the memory speed as 1067MHz.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Once you&#8217;ve nailed down what RAM upgrades you need to buy for the MacBook Pro, the next step is for you to choose whether you want to buy the cheapest MacBook  RAM you can find, or if you choose to buy name brand RAM such as Crucial Memory, which offer both a name brand product but also support as well that&#8217;s top notch too.  On a related note,  I got asked the other day if <a href="http://www.macmemorystore.com" rel="nofollow">Mac Memory Store</a> is any good?
</p>

<p>and my answer is, I don’t know. I have never bought RAM or dealt with them in any way. One way to check if a memory vendor is any good is to <a href="http://www.resellerratings.com">check the ratings they receive online</a>, but this isn’t always a good way to buy RAM either as people tend to complain far more than compliment so the results are weighted and usually for the worst. I can only recommend the best RAM Brands I can trust, and over the years have bought memory from myself, and I suggest you do the same if you’re looking to maximize your MacBook RAM but minimize the grief and trouble from dealing with unknown memory stores.</p>

There’s a list of the best memory stores in the top right corner where you can <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/">buy Mac RAM cheap</a>.</p>

<p>When you’ve decided that you do need to ugprade the RAM on your Mac Mini, and you’ve bought it online and are ready to replace your old Mac Mini RAM the next step is to figure out how to do this Mac Mini memory upgrade yourself because for the first time since the Apple Mac Mini was introduced – <strong>you can upgrade the Mac Mini RAM yourself</strong></p>

<p>In fact, the Mac Mini RAM Upgrade has to be one of the easiest Apple computers to upgrade and Apple even supplies you with instructions on <a href="http://manuals.info.apple.com/en_US/Mac_mini_Mid2010_User_Guide.pdf">how to boost the Mac Mini 2010 Memory</a></p>

<p>You can install up to 8GB of RAM in the 2010 Mac Mini in the two memory upgrade slots that are available, meaning you will have to buy 4GB RAM modules that are DDR3 SDRAM running at 1066MHz in a a 240 pin sodimm configuration. This is the exact same memory that’s used in the Apple iMacs, MacBook and MacBook Pros from 2010 as well. (The newest iMacs released last summer use DDR3 RAM which won’t work)</p>

<p>There are loads of <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">memory stores</a> that will sell you <strong>RAM cheap for the Mac Mini</strong> but 8GB upgrade kits for the Mac Mini should be priced under $100 from most memory upgrade vendors online today.</p>

<p>Now that Apple does not require you to open the Mac Min by voiding your warranty, the new 2010 Mac Mini is way easier to upgrade the memory on and I suggest you Max out the RAM on your Mac Mini for the <a>fastest Mac Mini you can buy</a> in 2011.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2011/03/dell-hp-sony-best-prices-on-computer-ram/">Best Prices on Computer RAM</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>But for the most of you, when you are in the market for <a href="http://www.knockoutprices.com">best prices of any kind</a> and for any product – not just computer memory upgrades, the term <strong>best equals cheapest price</strong> and when it comes down to best computer memory upgrade prices for your Apple, HP, Sony or Dell computer, to name a few popular brands.</p>

<p>The kicker is the word ‘<strong>best</strong>‘. For some, this the word best means cheapest computer ram, for others the word best might mean best computer support and for the last bunch it could all be about the best computer ram brands that is most important.The <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/">Best Prices on Computer RAM</a></strong> is the one of the questions I get asked and I answer every day.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001KB6Z2U/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001KB6Z2U&quot;&gt;Best Selling Computer RAM"><br />
<strong>Best Selling Computer RAM</strong></a></p>

<p>This means that with a few rare exceptions you will be in the market for generic RAM if price is king when it comes to shopping for RAM and you need to buy memory for your new computer. Sometimes, you can get lucky and pick up name brand RAM from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26x%3D0%26ref_%3Dnb_sb_noss%26y%3D0%26field-keywords%3Dkingston%2520ram%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">Kingston</a> or <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">Crucial</a> cheaper than the no name RAM but for most applications generic RAM is where you should be shopping for.</p>

<p>Lucky for you I track and monitor the best, or <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com">cheapest RAM prices</a></strong> for Apple but also PC manufacturers such as Sony, Dell, HP and Toshiba to name a few of the best selling PC manufacturers.</p>

<p>When shopping for the best computer ram prices or even hard drives too – all you need to do is visit a few websites and write down the price you see on the site of the memory store.</p>

<p>For example, if you need to <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/imac">buy iMac RAM</a> for a 2010 summer Apple iMac, the generic RAM is going to be much cheaper deal than if you had bought the RAM from Apple, which tends to ship their Macs with Samsung or Micron RAM upgrades, which are both name brand memory and not the cheaper ram that you want to buy. Apple, Dell and all charge a lot for RAM because they can. It’s assumed by a lot of consumers that because they make the computer they must be the best place to buy RAM too, and that’s not always the case.</p>

<p>You should always shop online and do a bit of research when ram shopping. Some memory stores not only offer free shipping, but some have limited time deals on memory and offer deals and discounts on your RAM purchase too. You can also use competitor’s pricing to see if you can get a better deal on RAM than the listed price, especially if you are buying RAM upgrades in bulk for your office or school needs where you plan to upgrade more than one PC at a time.</p>

<p>The one disadvantage to buying cheap RAM is that there is no brand associated with the memory. This can be a good thing as you’re not paying for the brand, and just the memory upgrade itself but where you could find problems with the best RAM is with customer support as quite a few memory ‘stores’ are just that when it comes to generic RAM. They buy the memory upgrades in bulk, test the RAM and compete on price alone for the cheapest RAM you can buy. This could be a problem if the memory store is less than reputable so it’s a good idea to check the ratings of the store you buy ram in the rare instance that you do have issues with the cheap ram you buy.</p>

<p>If you take your time and <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/where-to-buy-computer-memory-upgrades/">buy memory from a store you can trust</a> at a price you can afford, you will not only enjoy the savings benefit of <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/">buying the best RAM</a> but also know that in the rare case you do have memory problems, the memory store you buy from will be there with the memory help and support you need.</p>

<p>Flash Memory is the future. We’re already seeing it in smaller capacities and there’s a good chance you have a USB stick or flash drive or thumb drive or whatever you want to call them on your keychain, desktop drawer or in your pocket.</p>

<p>Flash Memory is also becoming more popular in consumer electronics such as tablet computers like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26x%3D0%26ref_%3Dnb_sb_noss%26y%3D0%26field-keywords%3Dipad%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">Apple iPad</a>, smartphones such as the Apple iPhone and other smart phones running the Android operating system and even the<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26x%3D0%26ref_%3Dnb_sb_noss%26y%3D0%26field-keywords%3Dipod%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957"> best selling Apple iPod line </a>relies on solid state flash memory to operate.</p>

<p>Until recently, solid state hard drives were very small in size or extremely expensive but just as <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/trending-ram-prices/">ram prices keep dropping </a>over time the SSD hard drives have also dropped making it quite possible and somewhat affordable to replace your notebook hard drive entirely with a SSD hard drive which offers much faster, and in some cases instant responsiveness. Startup times or how long it takes to wake your notebook from sleep are much faster with a SSD hard drive or flash based hard drive.</p>

<p>**Crucial SSD Hard Drive Sizes and Prices<br />
**</p>

<p>Many new notebook manufacturers such as Apple now offer the ability to upgrade the traditional hard drive technology to SSD drives at checkout when ordering a new notebook online, but you may be able to buy a SSD hard drive directly and upgrade you notebook hard drive yourself.</p>

<p>One company known for both digital camera memory as well as desktop and notebook memory and is a well known brand for ram upgrades has been offering SSD hard drives for sale for some time now, but only recently have the Crucial SSD drives been affordable where the cost does not outweigh the benefit of the added speed and reliability thanks to the fact that with a Crucial SSD drive there are no moving parts as there are in more standard or traditional hard drive technology offering a much more secure and safe method to transport your data.</p>

<p>Current SSD hard drives from Crucial Technology are available in three different sizes at <a href="http://www.kqzyfj.com/click-1548159-10863768">64GB</a>, <a href="http://www.kqzyfj.com/click-1548159-10863768">128GB</a> and <a href="http://www.kqzyfj.com/click-1548159-10863768">256GB</a> are compatible with a wide range of notebook and desktop computers. The 64GB is currently on sale at 124.99, the 128GB SSD drive is priced at $249.99 and the biggest SSD drive from Crucial is 256GB and $499.</p>

<p>As you can see from the SSD hard drive prices above this new hard drive technology, while affordable, can cost more money than standard hard drives but as the technology increases in the hard drive arena the SSD hard drive prices will fall.</p>

<p>Now that you’re aware of the prices of SSD hard drives, the next question is will your notebook or desktop be able to use and accomodate the much faster SSD hard drive from Crucial? With one of the best memory upgrade configurators in the market today for their ram and memory products it comes as no surprise that Crucial offers a configurator that will help you buy the best SSD hard drive for your computer as well. Just use the hand pull down menu and select your computer manufacturer, computer product line and specific computer model and you will get a free SSD hard drive compatibility report that will help you find the right SSD drive for your computing needs.</p>

<p>In my case, I am writing this on an Apple MacBook Pro. A 2008 Intel Core 2 Duo running at 2.4GHz and after entering the specifics of my particular Mac I am presented with a list of SSD hard drives that are guaranteed to be compatible with my MacBook Pro:<br />
<a href="http://www.kqzyfj.com/click-1548159-10863768"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1040" title="Best Price  SSD drives" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-13-at-4.49.17-PM.png" alt="solid state hard drive prices" width="532" height="470" /></a></p>

<p>This is all it takes to get the right solid state hard drive from Crucial Technology.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2011/03/apple-memorymacintosh-ram/">Macintosh RAM</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p><strong>Why RAM for Macs?</strong></p>

<p>Macintosh RAM are the ram prices I tend to monitor and track here on ramseeker and according to you guys, you are most interested in the best prices on Apple RAM too, even though I do track and monitor PC memory too which is common, some might say more common even than the Apple Products.</p>

<p>**<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I">See Best Macintosh RAM Prices</a><br />
**<br />
Apple products **for me **work better, run smoother and over the past two decades I’ve been a Mac user I just prefer a Mac over a PC when it comes to buying a computer, so I work with the Memory upgrades that I know and work with daily. I’m using a Mac right now (MacBook Pro) as I write this.</p>

<p>There once was a time about decade or so where the RAM for Macs were actually different and you could not interchange Mac and PC RAM at all, but in 2011 the difference between Mac and PC memory has pretty much disappeared and PC memory will work in your Mac and vice versa. This assumes the technical requirements for Apple and PC RAM is the same. If you’re trying to install notebook memory for Mac into a PC desktop, this is a recipe for disaster. But if the new windows notebook takes the same ram as the Mac you already have, you could swap out the RAM between Apple and PC computers.</p>

<p>Some stores list their memory upgrades as Apple only, and tend to cater to the Apple customer more. <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/ramjet">RAMJET</a> and <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/OWC">OWC</a> are two memory stores that have long supported and sold Apple RAM exclusively, where other vendors such as <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">Crucial</a> or <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/1800">18004Memory</a> also sell RAM for Macs but also carry RAM for Windows PC’s too.</p>

<p><strong>Where to Buy Macintosh RAM</strong></p>

<p>Apple RAM is available from a <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/where-to-buy-computer-memory-upgrades/">long list of stores</a> where you can <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">buy RAM</a> so I won’t repeat myself. There’s also a list of the best memory stores in the top right corner of this page of where you can buy Macintosh RAM for less than what you would pay if you had bough RAM from Apple Computer directly.</p>

<p>**Cheapest Memory Prices for Macintosh RAM **</p>

<p>I have been monitoring <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com">Apple RAM Prices</a></strong> for longer than I’d care to admit so the list is long of all the Macintosh computers I check the best prices for and over the years as new Apple computers get released, I update the site with RAM for the newest Macintosh computers available, as I did recently with the latest i5 and i7 MacBook Pros, but I also monitor prices for the 2010 Macintosh Models too. MacBook, iMac, Mac Mini and Mac Pro RAM prices are much cheaper when you <strong>buy ram online</strong> from some of the best RAM stores in the business today.</p>
