I can happily answer this question on **[where to get a good price on dell computer memory][1]** , but seeing as you didn&#8217;t specify whether you were looking for an upgrade on either your  Dell desktop computer or your Dell notebook, I&#8217;m going to hazard a guess and answer this as you were looking for **[cheap 8GB for Dell notebooks ][2]**as these notebook computers tend  to be the best selling computers you can buy from Dell in 2011.

Which **Dell Notebook**?<a style="line-height: 18px;" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004K1EQO6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=ramseeker-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B004K1EQO6"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1588" title="Cheapest Dell Inspiron" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-30-at-2.53.23-PM.png" alt="Cheap Dell Notebook RAM" width="575" height="470" /></a>

</p>

Now it&#8217;s time for me to ask questions. You didn&#8217;t tell me what computer model from Dell you specifically wanted  to upgrade when it comes to [Dell memory upgrades][3] so let&#8217;s assume you want to upgrade one of the most popular Dell notebooks on sale that will accept 8GB of RAM. This  would be the [Dell Inspiron Notebook][4], and though it ships standard from Dell with just **4GB of memory installed in this Dell Notebook**, the RAM can be  upgraded to 8GB effectively  doubling the RAM on this particular Dell notebook.

**Where to Buy Cheap Dell Memory Upgrades **

****I have created a great list of all the memory stores you could buy memory upgrades for Dell computers from and these are all great places to **buy RAM for Dell computers** (and many other computer brands too &#8211; not just Dell) . One of the best things about buying RAM from one of the vendors I list here is that you can be sure that all the **RAM upgrades you buy for your Dell** &#8211; 8GB or otherwise &#8211; will be that the **total cost for Dell memory** will be much cheaper thanks to the fact that Dell charges more for RAM in most instances than if you were to do a bit of shopping online and buy memory upgrades from a trusted memory source. The other reason is that with most **memory stores specializing in Dell RAM** you can save more money on RAM for Dells as you have the option to buy both the cheaper generic RAM for Dell, or if you prefer you can buy brand name  Dell memory upgrades but be aware that this  will cost you more than thew Generic RAM.  A few name brand memory manufacturers for Dell memory include [Crucial][2], [Kingston][5] and [Corsair][6].

**It costs nothing to install memory if you install the  RAM yourself. **For all but a few PC models  there&#8217;s no reason that with some common sense, a bit of research online for memory install instructions for your particular computer brand and model  and you can install ram yourself without the added expense of bringing your computer in to a computer store or computer service center.

[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1595" title="Most Popular RAM Upgrade" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-30-at-4.56.05-PM.png" alt="Best Selling RAM Upgrade" width="307" height="284" />][1]

<span style="line-height: 18px;">[table id=7 /]</span>

When in comes time to install memory on a desktop computer or notebooks, most ram upgrade installations can be done in ten minutes or less with the biggest problem you may encounter when installing memory being static electricity as memory for both notebook and desktops tend to be fragile and very sensitive when it comes to static electricity.

All you need to do to prevent the memory or your computer against static electricity is to ground yourself properly either by touching a metal part on your computer chassis to discharge any electricity you may have built up in (or  is it on?) you.  A better defense against static is to **[buy an anti-static wrist strap][2]** to ground yourself against any damage to your new RAM. This sounds like a big deal but in the 15 years I have been dealing with RAM I have never fried a stick of RAM using the precautions  I have mentioned.

&nbsp;

[<img title="Most Popular RAM Upgrade" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-30-at-4.56.05-PM.png" alt="Best Selling RAM Upgrade" width="307" height="284" />][1]

**[Best Selling Memory Upgrade][1]**

Installing your memory upgrades depends on your particular model.  For an example,  [installing memory on a Dell 1525 Inspiron][3] notebook consists of nothing more than removing eight screws on the bottom of the Dell notebook to get at the memory upgrade slots, removing the factory RAM installed by Dell  and replacing them with the  larger memory modules that you have bought, and then simply fasten the door on the bottom of the notebook again.

Installing RAM on Apple Notebooks pretty much works the same: In the case of installing MacBook Pro memory you do [pretty much the same ][4], except in the case of the Apple laptop you remove the entire bottom of  the laptop  instead of a small door on the back like you do with the Dell.

Desktop RAM installs are just as easy, if not more thanks to the fact that there&#8217;s more room to work with. Simply  unplug your desktop and all cables, remove the cover on your PC and lay the  PC chassis on it&#8217;s side where you will have easy access to the motherboard on your PC to access all the memory upgrade memory slots for your personal computer.

Tools required for memory installs usually just require a small philips screwdriver, or in rare cases a torx screwdriver and the anti static strap  mentioned earlier.

**[Save your money on memory upgrades ][5]**and memory installations and do the easy RAM installation yourself.

Short Answer: You&#8217;re better off just **[buying cheap MacBook Pro RAM][1]** than interchanging RAM upgrades.

The answer to the question on whether you can **swap out the RAM from an Apple iMac to an Apple MacBook Pro** depends on what specific **Apple iMac** and what specific **Apple MacBook Pro** you want to change or switch the memory from as all [MacBook Pro ram upgrades][2] are not the same as all [iMac memory upgrades,][3] so you need to be very specific what exact Apple model you wish to perform this task with, as the  answer to this could depend:Yes or No.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1580" title="Buy cheap MacBook Pro RAM" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-30-at-1.31.36-PM.png" alt="Buy RAM for MacBook Pro " width="310" height="218" />I  guess my first question is considering the **[cheap price of Apple Memory][4]** these days and that for both the **Apple iMac and the MacBook Pro RAM is so cheap**, why don&#8217;t you just **[buy more Macbook Pro memory][5]** and be done with it. As I see it, you want to **remove RAM from Apple iMac** and **Install RAM on MacBook Pro** but my question is **why**?

This will leave you with an **Apple iMac with too little RAM,** or at very least not enough ram or less RAM than you had  before in the iMac and  **more RAM in the MacBo0k Pro**. I don&#8217;t recommend this and really except for  a few rare instances (16GB for MBP)  and bigger ram upgrades for Mac Pro &#8211; all **[Apple memory upgrades][6]** should for the most part ship for under $100 for 8GB of RAM which not the maximum RAM on either machines, sounds to me like a better idea than what you&#8217;ve got planned.

But yes (**again, I don&#8217;t recommend this.  Do so at your own risk..etc**) if you want to or need to **swap RAM from an iMac to MacBook Pro** you can, but you have to pay attention to the speed of memory in both machines. In the case of the **latest iMacs which were announced summer 2010** and the MacBook Pros just announced last month, these two do accept DDR3 SDRAM sodimms that could (have I mentioned I don&#8217;t recommend this?) be swapped from an iMac to a MacBook Pro.

You&#8217;re much better off **[buying new RAM for the MacBook Pro][1]** and leaving the  RAM inside the Apple iMac

Oddly enough, if you&#8217;re in the market to buy a a new MacBook, if  you want to get a good deal on a MacBook you can do much better on  the price if you **do not buy  the MacBook from  Apple** and  **buy a MacBook from Amazon** instead. When you buy the MacBook at the Apple Store you get to pay full list price for your MacBook, and in the age of the internet where **deals on Apple Macs **are just  a click away, why would you buy  a Mac from Apple when you can buy it less than the $999 MSRP somewhere else

&nbsp;

I like Amazon when **buying Apple products** as they offer bundles and special offers on not only your MacBook  but Mac accessories like Apple Displays, Mice, external keyboards and even [MacBook RAM upgrades][1].<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1600" title="Cheapest MacBook " src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-30-at-5.31.00-PM.png" alt="Best Price MacBook" width="303" height="243" />

At the time I write this, Amazon offers a **MacBook Bundle **that consists of the MacBook at a discount, but also Microsoft Office and AppleCare for your Macbook is also offered at a much cheaper price than had you bought the MacBook Pro.

Apple does offer refurbished MacBooks for less than what you would pay for a new MacBook, but you are not  buying a new MacBook but pre-owned MacBook or refurb, which might be a better price than a new MacBook, you might be buying problems rather than a deal, whereas if you stick with a new MacBook that&#8217;s priced well under the $999 MSRP from Apple you deal with what is probably one of the better vendors online regardless of what manufacturer you want, not just Apple.

Of course, when it comes time to get the **[best price on RAM for your new Apple MacBook][2]** you&#8217;re already at the right place, and I can recommend many memory sellers that can offer deals on Apple RAM too.

<br>

		<div class="post-content">[table id=1 /]

But I&#8217;m going to assume that when you ask what the **difference is between 4GB of RAM for MacBook Pro and [8GB of MacBook RAM][1]** it&#8217;s due to the fact that you&#8217;re talking about the **[best prices for MacBook Memory][2]** and you want to know **what RAM you should buy for your MacBook Pro** and whether it&#8217;s worth the added cost to make the upgrade from 4GB  to 8GB, or if you really need to upgrade the MacBook Pro then **[16GB of MacBook Pro Memory][3]**, but this last option is still very pricey with a street price of $1600 &#8211; almost the same as the cost of the **[cheapest MacBook Pro][4]** &#8211; the Apple 13 inch MacBook Pro.**4GB, Obviously.**

[table id=15 /]

As all **currently shipping MacBook Pros** come out of the box with 4GB of memory already installed you really can only consider the **8GB Apple MacBook Pro Memory Upgrade Kits** consisting of two 4GB DDR3 SDRAM 1333Mhz so-dimms to be the only upgrade option when it comes to **uprading your MPB with more RAM**.

When it comes to pricing differences between **4GB for Apple MacBook Pro Memory** the cost difference is about half and rather than tell you a price on **MacBook Pro RAM,** that will be outdated by the time  you read this article, I&#8217;ll show you instead as the ram prices for MacBook Pros below are constantly updated so you can always get the best price on Apple MacBook Pro memory upgrades:

**Best MacBook Pro RAM Prices**

A MacBook Pro RAM Upgrade is one of the cheapest, easiest upgrades you can perform on your professional Mac notebook and with 8GB RAM for MacBook Pro available for under $100, this is a pretty easy upgrade to consider. I recommend it.

<br>

		<div class="post-content">**Too much.**

Apple MacBook Pro Memory Upgrades for much less than Apple charges:

That&#8217;s what it costs for the **Apple Store to add ram to your Mac **as not only will you have to **pay more for Apple memory** than what you could buy elsewhere for even name brand RAM, which tends to be on the pricier side of things anyway such as [Kingston Memory][1] or [Crucial memory,][2] but you also have to endure the inconvenience of physically taking your Mac to the Apple Store,  and maybe it&#8217;s just  my bad luck but in the few times I have been to an Apple Store, the stores have always been packed with  people which a great  thing for Apple, as they sell more [iPods][3], [iPads][4] and [Apple Mac Computers][5] but for the Macintosh user who **just wants more ram installed**, regardless of what Mac you wish to upgrade and that&#8217;s to **install the Apple RAM yourself** and save money on memory upgrades in the process.

Let&#8217;s use a **13 inch MacBook Pro** as an example, as it currently is the **[best selling notebook][6]** &#8211; regardless of computer manufacturer, so there&#8217;s definitely a market not only for this article, but for cheap and good MacBook Pro RAM overall that&#8217;s much cheaper than what Apple charges for RAM. As I write this to double the RAM on a new MacBook Pro will cost you $400 for 8GB of  13 inch MacBook Pro Memory.

[table id=15 /]

&nbsp;

**[Much Cheaper Apple Memory][7]**

&nbsp;

Compare that to third party memory stores where you can buy the same **[8GB MacBook Pro Memory][8]** for under $100.  I don&#8217;t know about you but I sure don&#8217;t have an extra $300 to spend for the priveledge of **buying ram from Apple** when I can buy pretty much the same memory for less, much less. **75% savings off $400 for MacBook Pro RAM** is nothing to sneeze at, and if I do feel the need to give Apple more money I can do so with the purchase of an **iPod** or even use the savings on Apple RAM towards an **Apple iPad**.

To be fair, the **[cheapest RAM for MacBook Pros][9]**are going to come as **generic RAM,** And although  it&#8217;s not specified there&#8217;s a very good chance your new MacBook Pro will ship with name brand memory upgrades.  The last MacBook I bought had **[Micron RAM ][2]**installed at default, which even though it&#8217;s name brand still only  has a street price of about $100 or perhaps a bit over. You&#8217;ll be fine with RAM from third party memory stores that are established online RAM vendors who sell a **quality generic RAM product**.

Now the best part. You can **install RAM yourself** for any current and discontinued Mac and in the case of the current Macs adding RAM upgrades yourself will not void your Apple limited warranty and [Apple even provides memory upgrade instructions][9] that will help you with the task of a memory install yourself.

I see no reason to either buy RAM from Apple either online, or direct as the cost is very high compared to much **[cheaper Apple Memory upgrade options][7]**

Regardless of What MacBook Pro you decide on, you should buy more RAM as this is the best and cheapest MacBook Pro upgrade you can do.

This is a very good question, as with the release of the **[new MacBook Pros ][1]**just over a month ago there&#8217;s some excellent choices as Apple now offers the **MacBook Pro in many configurations** that include different screen sizes, processor speeds and video card specifications too. Then, there&#8217;s the price on the **[MacBook Pros that start at just $1199][2]**. (this is a good deal, and only $200 more than a MacBook) and go all the way to **$2499 for the 17 inch MacBook Pro which** is the perfect choice for the desktop replacement.<a style="line-height: 18px;" href="ttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=ramseeker-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1484" title="Best Selling Notebook" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Screen-shot-2011-03-26-at-2.24.37-PM.png" alt="Best laptop" width="300" height="242" /></a>

<p style="line-height: 18px;">
  <strong><a href="ttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=ramseeker-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I">MacBook Pro models start at just $1199</a></strong>
</p>

If you determine &#8216;**best**&#8216; to equal **cheapest MacBook Pro** then your MBP of choice is the **thirteen inch  MacBook Pro**, and for a lot of us this is the  only way we could afford a MacBook Pro  as the **[prices for 15 inch MacBook Pro models ][3]**hover closer to the two thousand dollar mark which can be a lot of money for some of us and could be a big price to justify considering  you can buy a **[best selling windows notebook][4]** for about one quarter of the cost.

I can&#8217;t really tell you what the **[best MacBook Pro][5]** is, as I have no idea what you value most. For some of us **price is the most important factor** and the 13 inch MBP is the best bet, yet for others **all the screen real estate  and power they can squeeze out of  a MacBook Pro** means you&#8217;ll be the most productive as possible and that means the 17 inch MacBook Pro is the perfect fit.

I  can tell you that currently the two **best selling MacBook Pros** are the lowest priced MacBook Pro &#8211; **[the 13.3 inch 2.3GHz][2]** model and another popular portable Mac is the **[Apple MacBook Pro 15 inch 2.0 Ghz][3]** as these two MacBook Pros are priced under $2000.

The  13 inch MacBook Pro is the [most popular notebook in 2011 ][6] thanks to the price/performance ratio, whereas the 15 inch MBP is a **best selling Mac notebook** as it feels much bigger than the 13.3 inch model but is a more common screen size than the 17 inch MacBook Pro which can be still pretty bulky if you plan on actually using this MacBook Pro as your primary Apple Mac Notebook computer, in my opinion &#8211; as  beautiful as that big screen may be.

One other thing to think about is **processor speed and graphics**. Personally,  I  tend to do a lot of tasks where the computer is waiting for me, such as writing so I&#8217;m  plunking away quite happily on a **MacBook Pro 2008** Unibody model with [4GB of RAM][7] and because  waiting a few more seconds for the wheel to spin is not a big deal. But if you plan on **using your notebook for graphics or video** than faster processors  and  video cards  just got a lot more  important and even if the cost of initial purchase  is going to be higher, you can benefit  from the  **fastest notebook and get  more work done faster**. In my particular case it&#8217;s going to take me the same time to type this on a  low end MacBook Pro than it is the fastest MacBook Prow money can buy.

**Buying a MacBook Pro.**

** **When you&#8217;ve decided on what MacBook Pro you need to buy, you can **[get a much better MacBook Pro deal][8]** at Amazon  than anywhere else with discounts available on all Apple products and not just Mac portables when you buy online and in most cases you&#8217;ll avoid sales taxes which on two thousand dollar computers can add up to a fair bit of coin and be a **significant savings** regardless of what MacBook Pro you decide to buy.

   <B> <h1><a href="/2011/03/best-notebook-computers-of-2011/">Best NoteBook Computers of 2011</a></h1></B>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content">Now that we&#8217;ve got three months or so into the year 2011, I thought it might be a good time to stop and check out the best selling notebook computers in 2011 to date, as the best computer in 2010 can be nowhere to be seen a month or so later as new notebook models are announced two things happen. The first is that the now discontinued models of computers go on sale as the manufacturers want to clear the inventory  of older notebooks so that the only notebooks in the sales channel are the newly announced laptops.

<div style="float: right; margin-right: 5px;">
</div>

<div style="float: right; margin-right: 5px;">
</div>

This has always been this way and the best time to buy a notebook could be the day the new models are announced as yesterday&#8217;s new and modern laptop  is now on sale for much less money than the day before.  I have bought many an Apple notebook this way, and saved at very least about 10 percent, if not  more of deal on a MacBook Pro. The new MacBook Pro&#8217;s get released, and the older MacBook Pro&#8217;s go on sale. This technique only works if you  understand the needs for your personal situation as for some, saving money on notebooks might not be worth it and you&#8217;re best to buy the latest and new laptop instead.

Let&#8217;s have a look at what&#8217;s the **[best deal and best selling notebook][1]** to date in 2011:

**[Apple MacBook Pro 13 inch][2]**

**[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1552" title="Best Notebook Computer in 2011" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-29-at-7.19.01-AM.png" alt="Cheapest 2011 Apple Notebook" width="299" height="232" />][2]**

**[See Cheapest Price on MacBook Pro 13 Inch][2]**

A decade or so ago, the idea of an Apple Computer being the best selling computer today in any format  &#8211; notebook  or  desktop, would be considered laughable with PC notebooks being the best sellers year over year, but over the years Apple has reversed their fortunes and now make  the best notebook you can buy today with the Apple MacBook Pro 13 inch model. Featuring a dual core Intel i5 processor running at 2.3GHz, this particular Apple MacBook Pro also holds the distinction of being the cheapest notebook from Apple you can buy in the MacBook Pro lineup. With this model, the Pro version of Apple&#8217;s notebook is within reach of most consumers and is priced just 20% more than the Apple MacBook, Apple&#8217;s consumer notebook.

As with all notebook releases, the MacBook Pro runs faster than it&#8217;s predecessors but also brings new technology to the Apple notebook arena in the form of Thunderbolt I/O Technology which is much faster than USB and even FireWire and the first Mac, notebook or desktop to feature this new high speed interface. More RAM, a 320 GB hard drive and a new FaceTime built in web camera round out what&#8217; new on the MacBook Pro and why  it is the best selling notebook computer today.

**[Toshiba Satellite L655-S5158 15.6-Inch Laptop][3]**

**[<img title="Best Selling Toshiba Notebook " src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-29-at-11.37.08-AM.png" alt="Cheapest Toshiba NoteBook" width="287" height="205" />][3]**

[**See Cheapest **][3]**[Toshiba Satellite L655-S5158 15.6-Inch Laptop Price][3]**

One of the biggest reasons for the Toshiba Satellite L655-S5158 to take the number  2 spot is the fact that it&#8217;s one of the better value notebooks available today when it comes to price. For the MacBook Pro above, the discount is rather tiny when compared to this Toshiba notebook that comes in priced at half the price of the Apple Mac above.

Featuring a fast **2.53 GHz Intel Core i3-380M dual-core processor **with Intel HD graphics, and with the help of the Intel Hyper-Threading technology that allows you do two tasks at the same time resulting in even more productivity when working with this 15.6 inch Toshiba notebook computer.

4GB of DDR3 SDRAM ships standard with the Toshiba and a 640 GB hard drive means you will have lots of room for your files, photos, music and movies and with up  to five hours of battery life that helps when you need remote computing away from power supplies, such as when traveling, the Toshiba Satellite L655-S51858 notebooks is the perfect travel notebook whether your travels take you around the world or just next door.

**[Acer AS5736Z-4427 15.6-Inch Laptop][4]**

**[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1555" title="Cheapest Acer Notebook" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-29-at-11.39.19-AM.png" alt="Best Acer Laptop" width="312" height="283" />][4]**

**[Click for Best Price on Acer AS5736z-4427][1]**

One of the biggest reasons the Acer AS5736Z-4427  is on the best selling notebooks list is that this is the cheapest notebook of the top 3 notebooks  for 2011 and is one of the few notebooks under $400. While the two laptop computers above are priced more, don&#8217;t let this lowest priced notebook fool you into thinking this is a cheap acer notebook that&#8217;s not up to the task.

The 15.6 inch LCD widescreen display is perfect for fun stuff like watching movies thanks to it&#8217;s 16:9 widescreen display,  and the fast dual-core Intel Pentium T4500 processor that&#8217;s more than fast enough for everyday computing such as facebook, email, web browsing  and working with digital files such as movies, music and digital photos. 2GB of DDR RAM, a 250 GB hard drive, Windows 7, and Microsoft Office Starter Kit just a few of the more notable features on this cheap acer computer that for the price, is hard to beat and offers much better value than a cheap netbook computer might offer but with the Acer you can enjoy a full size keyboard and screen, something even the best netbooks can&#8217;t match.

You can&#8217;t go wrong with any one of the best selling notebooks available today as they offer excellent value and are available to buy in every price point, regardless of your notebook computer budget

		<div class="post-content">**Best iMac Memory**

Almost all memory stores online offer something that&#8217;s called a memory configurator which  is  really just a way to search for  the correct ram upgrade for your Mac. You do need to be aware that some memory stores sell memory upgrades for Apple by individual memory chip, while others market their memory upgrades a bit better and sell memory upgrade kits, something that in 2011 is required as I recommend you buy RAM in matched pairs regardless of whether it&#8217;s technically required or not.  With the fact that RAM is the cheapest it&#8217;s been, well, ever  &#8211; it makes no sense to me not to buy RAM that matches.The [Best Mac Memory][1] is sold by so many memory stores it&#8217;s hard to keep track of [memory stores][2], let alone where to get the [best memory prices][3] (I&#8217;ll come back to that in a minute or two) but first we need to determine what Apple Mac you specifically need to upgrade with RAM, as all memory does not work or is compatible with all Apple computers in 2011 so it&#8217;s a good idea to figure out what memory  you need to buy.  
**Cheapest Apple iMac  
**  
The Apple iMac comes in four different models: two Apple iMacs offer 21 inch LCD displays, while the other 2 feature 27 inch displays.  On the 21 inch iMac, processor speeds can start at 3.06GHz Intel Core i3, and then work upwards to 3.2GGzh and  3.2GHz Intel Core i3 while the 27 inch iMacs offer processor speeds of 3.2 GHz Intel Core i3 and lastly a quad core 2.8GHz Intel Core i5 processor being the fastest iMac you can buy today.

But regardless of what specific Apple iMac you choose to buy, they all require the same memory upgrades: 1333GHz DDR3 SDRAM so-dimms are on sale at the lowest prices from a variety of online memory stores and the best iMac RAM Prices are here:

**Best Mac Mini Memory**  
[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1531" title="Apple's Best Selling Desktop" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-28-at-12.34.40-PM.png" alt="Best Selling Desktop Computer" width="285" height="205" />][4]  
**[Best Price on Apple Mac Mini][4]  
**  
The Apple Mac Mini only ships in one model, (well, OK, there&#8217;s the Mac Mini Server) but for the rest of us that want to upgrade the cheapest co  
mputer Apple sells than the standard Mac Mini, it is. The Mac Mini requires slower RAM than the Apple iMac and uses DDR3 1066 SDRAM so-dimms available from a variety of vendors, but again it&#8217;s recommended to buy Mac Min RAM in matched pairs by me. Mac Mini RAM is so cheap it&#8217;s not advisable to mix and match RAM for the Mac Mini and suffer the performance problems that may occur as a result. The Apple Mac Mini only ships with a mere 2GB of RAM, so an upgrade to 8GB for Mac Mini is recommended

The cheapest Mac Mini RAM prices can be found here:

**<a>Cheapest Apple MacBook</a>  
**  
The MacBook from Apple is limited to only one MacBook model on sale currently- the 2.4GHz MacBook Intel Core 2 Duo, which ships with 2GB of RAM installed in the two MacBook memory upgrade slots available. The maximum MacBook RAM allowed on the 2011 MacBook is 4GB of RAM, which means you can, and I suggest you do, double your MacBook RAM. Like the other Mac models, I do suggest you replace the RAM in pairs, although technically you don&#8217;t have to, there&#8217;s very little performance increase in 3GB of RAM over 2 GB so you are much better off with upgrading all the way to 4GB of RAM for MacBook Pro.

MacBook Pro RAM is super cheap for DDR3 SDRAM 1066 so-dimms, the RAM you need to buy for the MacBook so even if you&#8217;re remotely considering a MacBook Upgrade, I suggest you do it.

**Best Mac Pro Memory **

[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1537" title="Apple Mac Pro" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-28-at-3.30.08-PM.png" alt="Cheapest Mac Pro" width="257" height="260" />][6]

**[Cheapest Apple Mac Pro][6]  
**

The Apple Mac Pro is the professional Mac for those that make their living with an Apple computer and when it comes time to buying memory for this specific Apple Computer Model which more than any other Macs available to buy today, as these high powered desktops can accept the most memory out of any other mac available today with 64GB of RAM for Mac Pros for purchase. The Mac Pro comes in a selection of processor speeds, Quad Core 2.8GHz Quad Core Intel Xeon Processor, 8 Core with two Quad Core Intel Xeon Processors and 12 core with two six core Intel Processors and depending on the model of Mac Pro you have, requires either DDR3 1066 SDRAM DIMMS or DDR3 1333 SDRAM DIMMS, with the dual processor Mac Pro systems using the slower DDR3 1066 SDRAM and the 2.66Mhz and 2.93Mhz Mac Pros running the faster RAM at 1333Mhz.

**[Best Selling MacBook Pro][7]**

The Apple MacBook Pro is all new for 2011 and now offers much faster processing power and new RAM upgrade requirements than the older 2010 MacBook Pros. The new MacBook Pro models require DDR3 1333Mhz sodimms to run or be upgraded to 8GB of RAM (and in some cases, 16GB of MacBook Pro RAM) and require the same memory upgrades whether you need to upgrade a 13 inch MacBook Pro or a 15 inch or 17 inch Macbook Pro, the RAM requirements are all the same.
