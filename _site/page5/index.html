    <h1><a href="/2011/03/dell-hp-sony-best-prices-on-computer-ram/">Best Prices on Computer RAM</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>But for the most of you, when you are in the market for <a href="http://www.knockoutprices.com">best prices of any kind</a> and for any product – not just computer memory upgrades, the term <strong>best equals cheapest price</strong> and when it comes down to best computer memory upgrade prices for your Apple, HP, Sony or Dell computer, to name a few popular brands.</p>

<p>The kicker is the word ‘<strong>best</strong>‘. For some, this the word best means cheapest computer ram, for others the word best might mean best computer support and for the last bunch it could all be about the best computer ram brands that is most important.The <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/">Best Prices on Computer RAM</a></strong> is the one of the questions I get asked and I answer every day.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001KB6Z2U/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001KB6Z2U&quot;&gt;Best Selling Computer RAM"><br />
<strong>Best Selling Computer RAM</strong></a></p>

<p>This means that with a few rare exceptions you will be in the market for generic RAM if price is king when it comes to shopping for RAM and you need to buy memory for your new computer. Sometimes, you can get lucky and pick up name brand RAM from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26x%3D0%26ref_%3Dnb_sb_noss%26y%3D0%26field-keywords%3Dkingston%2520ram%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">Kingston</a> or <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">Crucial</a> cheaper than the no name RAM but for most applications generic RAM is where you should be shopping for.</p>

<p>Lucky for you I track and monitor the best, or <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com">cheapest RAM prices</a></strong> for Apple but also PC manufacturers such as Sony, Dell, HP and Toshiba to name a few of the best selling PC manufacturers.</p>

<p>When shopping for the best computer ram prices or even hard drives too – all you need to do is visit a few websites and write down the price you see on the site of the memory store.</p>

<p>For example, if you need to <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/imac">buy iMac RAM</a> for a 2010 summer Apple iMac, the generic RAM is going to be much cheaper deal than if you had bought the RAM from Apple, which tends to ship their Macs with Samsung or Micron RAM upgrades, which are both name brand memory and not the cheaper ram that you want to buy. Apple, Dell and all charge a lot for RAM because they can. It’s assumed by a lot of consumers that because they make the computer they must be the best place to buy RAM too, and that’s not always the case.</p>

<p>You should always shop online and do a bit of research when ram shopping. Some memory stores not only offer free shipping, but some have limited time deals on memory and offer deals and discounts on your RAM purchase too. You can also use competitor’s pricing to see if you can get a better deal on RAM than the listed price, especially if you are buying RAM upgrades in bulk for your office or school needs where you plan to upgrade more than one PC at a time.</p>

<p>The one disadvantage to buying cheap RAM is that there is no brand associated with the memory. This can be a good thing as you’re not paying for the brand, and just the memory upgrade itself but where you could find problems with the best RAM is with customer support as quite a few memory ‘stores’ are just that when it comes to generic RAM. They buy the memory upgrades in bulk, test the RAM and compete on price alone for the cheapest RAM you can buy. This could be a problem if the memory store is less than reputable so it’s a good idea to check the ratings of the store you buy ram in the rare instance that you do have issues with the cheap ram you buy.</p>

<p>If you take your time and <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/where-to-buy-computer-memory-upgrades/">buy memory from a store you can trust</a> at a price you can afford, you will not only enjoy the savings benefit of <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/">buying the best RAM</a> but also know that in the rare case you do have memory problems, the memory store you buy from will be there with the memory help and support you need.</p>

</div>

<p>Flash Memory is the future. We’re already seeing it in smaller capacities and there’s a good chance you have a USB stick or flash drive or thumb drive or whatever you want to call them on your keychain, desktop drawer or in your pocket.</p>

<p>Flash Memory is also becoming more popular in consumer electronics such as tablet computers like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26x%3D0%26ref_%3Dnb_sb_noss%26y%3D0%26field-keywords%3Dipad%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">Apple iPad</a>, smartphones such as the Apple iPhone and other smart phones running the Android operating system and even the<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26x%3D0%26ref_%3Dnb_sb_noss%26y%3D0%26field-keywords%3Dipod%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957"> best selling Apple iPod line </a>relies on solid state flash memory to operate.</p>

<p>Until recently, solid state hard drives were very small in size or extremely expensive but just as <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/trending-ram-prices/">ram prices keep dropping </a>over time the SSD hard drives have also dropped making it quite possible and somewhat affordable to replace your notebook hard drive entirely with a SSD hard drive which offers much faster, and in some cases instant responsiveness. Startup times or how long it takes to wake your notebook from sleep are much faster with a SSD hard drive or flash based hard drive.</p>

<p>**Crucial SSD Hard Drive Sizes and Prices<br />
**</p>

<p>Many new notebook manufacturers such as Apple now offer the ability to upgrade the traditional hard drive technology to SSD drives at checkout when ordering a new notebook online, but you may be able to buy a SSD hard drive directly and upgrade you notebook hard drive yourself.</p>

<p>One company known for both digital camera memory as well as desktop and notebook memory and is a well known brand for ram upgrades has been offering SSD hard drives for sale for some time now, but only recently have the Crucial SSD drives been affordable where the cost does not outweigh the benefit of the added speed and reliability thanks to the fact that with a Crucial SSD drive there are no moving parts as there are in more standard or traditional hard drive technology offering a much more secure and safe method to transport your data.</p>

<p>Current SSD hard drives from Crucial Technology are available in three different sizes at <a href="http://www.kqzyfj.com/click-1548159-10863768">64GB</a>, <a href="http://www.kqzyfj.com/click-1548159-10863768">128GB</a> and <a href="http://www.kqzyfj.com/click-1548159-10863768">256GB</a> are compatible with a wide range of notebook and desktop computers. The 64GB is currently on sale at 124.99, the 128GB SSD drive is priced at $249.99 and the biggest SSD drive from Crucial is 256GB and $499.</p>

<p>As you can see from the SSD hard drive prices above this new hard drive technology, while affordable, can cost more money than standard hard drives but as the technology increases in the hard drive arena the SSD hard drive prices will fall.</p>

<p>Now that you’re aware of the prices of SSD hard drives, the next question is will your notebook or desktop be able to use and accomodate the much faster SSD hard drive from Crucial? With one of the best memory upgrade configurators in the market today for their ram and memory products it comes as no surprise that Crucial offers a configurator that will help you buy the best SSD hard drive for your computer as well. Just use the hand pull down menu and select your computer manufacturer, computer product line and specific computer model and you will get a free SSD hard drive compatibility report that will help you find the right SSD drive for your computing needs.</p>

<p>In my case, I am writing this on an Apple MacBook Pro. A 2008 Intel Core 2 Duo running at 2.4GHz and after entering the specifics of my particular Mac I am presented with a list of SSD hard drives that are guaranteed to be compatible with my MacBook Pro:<br />
<a href="http://www.kqzyfj.com/click-1548159-10863768"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1040" title="Best Price  SSD drives" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-13-at-4.49.17-PM.png" alt="solid state hard drive prices" width="532" height="470" /></a></p>

<p>This is all it takes to get the right solid state hard drive from Crucial Technology.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2011/03/apple-memorymacintosh-ram/">Macintosh RAM</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p><strong>Why RAM for Macs?</strong></p>

<p>Macintosh RAM are the ram prices I tend to monitor and track here on ramseeker and according to you guys, you are most interested in the best prices on Apple RAM too, even though I do track and monitor PC memory too which is common, some might say more common even than the Apple Products.</p>

<p>**<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I">See Best Macintosh RAM Prices</a><br />
**<br />
Apple products **for me **work better, run smoother and over the past two decades I’ve been a Mac user I just prefer a Mac over a PC when it comes to buying a computer, so I work with the Memory upgrades that I know and work with daily. I’m using a Mac right now (MacBook Pro) as I write this.</p>

<p>There once was a time about decade or so where the RAM for Macs were actually different and you could not interchange Mac and PC RAM at all, but in 2011 the difference between Mac and PC memory has pretty much disappeared and PC memory will work in your Mac and vice versa. This assumes the technical requirements for Apple and PC RAM is the same. If you’re trying to install notebook memory for Mac into a PC desktop, this is a recipe for disaster. But if the new windows notebook takes the same ram as the Mac you already have, you could swap out the RAM between Apple and PC computers.</p>

<p>Some stores list their memory upgrades as Apple only, and tend to cater to the Apple customer more. <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/ramjet">RAMJET</a> and <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/OWC">OWC</a> are two memory stores that have long supported and sold Apple RAM exclusively, where other vendors such as <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">Crucial</a> or <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/1800">18004Memory</a> also sell RAM for Macs but also carry RAM for Windows PC’s too.</p>

<p><strong>Where to Buy Macintosh RAM</strong></p>

<p>Apple RAM is available from a <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/where-to-buy-computer-memory-upgrades/">long list of stores</a> where you can <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">buy RAM</a> so I won’t repeat myself. There’s also a list of the best memory stores in the top right corner of this page of where you can buy Macintosh RAM for less than what you would pay if you had bough RAM from Apple Computer directly.</p>

<p>**Cheapest Memory Prices for Macintosh RAM **</p>

<p>I have been monitoring <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com">Apple RAM Prices</a></strong> for longer than I’d care to admit so the list is long of all the Macintosh computers I check the best prices for and over the years as new Apple computers get released, I update the site with RAM for the newest Macintosh computers available, as I did recently with the latest i5 and i7 MacBook Pros, but I also monitor prices for the 2010 Macintosh Models too. MacBook, iMac, Mac Mini and Mac Pro RAM prices are much cheaper when you <strong>buy ram online</strong> from some of the best RAM stores in the business today.</p>

<div style="float: right; margin-right: 5px;">
</div>

<p>When shopping for the **<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26scn%3D541966%26redirect%3Dtrue%26ref_%3Dsr_nr_scat_541966_t%26keywords%3Dmacbook%26qid%3D1299936793%26h%3D179243ea296a92643bd104ef6c759ae67c9c0702%26rh%3Dn%253A541966%252Ck%253Amacbook&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">best MacBook deal</a> **one might assume that you would get the lowest price on a MacBook (and MacBook accessories, for that matter) directly from the the mother ship itself: <a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple</a>.</p>

<p>But that’s not the case and if you <strong>shop around for a MacBook</strong> you can get a pretty good price. Gone are the days where we could just buy, buy, buy and barely look at the <strong>price of Apple computers</strong> and if you’re in the market to buy a MacBook which is the budget notebook from Apple there’s a good chance you have a budget for this new MacBook purchase and you can only spend so much money on Apple’s consumer portable.</p>

<p>**MacBook Deals at Apple<br />
**<br />
One of the first places I check for MacBook deals is <a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple</a>. Then you know exactly how much a MacBook would cost when you buy it from the Apple Store.</p>

<p>We’re going to assume you’re shopping for a brand new MacBook and if you’re in the market for a used MacBook which are still viable machines, a good place to start shopping for used macbook deals are <a href="http://www.ebay.com">eBay</a> and <a href="http://www.craigslist.com">Craigslist</a> where you can with some time effort and patience get a great deal on a used MacBook but you have to be much more aware of scams and dishonest sellers than if you were to buy a new MacBook from an Apple Authorized dealer.</p>

<p>**MacBook Deals at Amazon<br />
**<br />
One of the first places I check for Apple MacBooks at better prices than Apple is Amazon. The savings may not be much (usually just a few percent) but the benefit of Amazon is they offer bundles for greater savings on MacBook Accesories</p>

<p>An example would be like this Apple MacBook Bundle:<br />
Buy the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002C7489S/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002C7489S">Apple MacBook 13 inch</a>, add <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VWK4NI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002VWK4NI">AppleCare</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003YCOJAI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B003YCOJAI">Microsoft Office Mac</a> for Home and Student and you get a much better deal on the these three items than if you had bought them individually. The savings on the MacBook alone is worth it as the final price is much closer to $900 than the $999 MSRP from Apple.</p>

<p>**MacMall MacBook Bundles<br />
**<br />
MacMall has long been another favorite of mine when in the market for a new Apple computer as this online Apple store usually has some really good deals on MacBooks that you can’t beat as their approach is a bit different when pricing MacBooks. Instead of creating bundles as is popular when you buy a MacBook from Amazon, MacMall tends to compete by offering a lot of free MacBook accessories such as printers, mice and software to sweeten the MacBook deal. Or sometimes they just offer the MacBook for much less than the Apple Store would charge. A **$<a href="http://www.kqzyfj.com/click-1548159-10380674">935.00 MacBook Price</a> **is much better than a $999 MacBook Price in my books. That’s a $65 saving for buying the exact same item and a much better Macbook deal overall.</p>

<p>With the release of the latest Apple MacBook Pro models a few weeks back, and the past few weeks of most memory stores adding the MacBook Pro RAM to their stores, I think it’s safe to say that with few exceptions the MacBook Pro Memory prices have settled and now we know what’s available for RAM for the first new Macs to come from Apple in 2011<br />
[table id=1 /]</p>

<p>I have specifically highlighted a few stores that were <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/ramjet">first</a> <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">to</a> <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/OWC">market</a> the MacBook Pro RAM, and earlier this week we also know that you can <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/2011-apple-macbook-pro-16gb-memory-upgrades/">spend more on RAM for MacBook Pros</a> than the MacBook Pro itself with $1700 RAM upgrades for MacBook Pro’s being available to purchase. My guess is the 16GB RAM prices will settle once more vendors come online with 16GB MacBook Pr RAM, and unless every millisecond counts the 8GB MacBook Pro RAM Kits offer far more reasonable value with <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">MacBook Pro RAM  under $100 </a></strong>– a fraction of what it costs for the 16GB RAM upgrade kits</p>

<p style="line-height: 18px;">
  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1136" title="Best Price MacBook Pro" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-24-at-7.39.14-AM.png" alt="See Best Price on MacBook Pro" width="283" height="223" /></a>
</p>

<p><strong style="line-height: 18px;"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I">Best MacBook Pro Prices</a></strong></p>

<p><strong style="line-height: 18px;"></strong>At the time I write this  you can buy 8GB, 12GB, and now 16GB RAM for MacBook Pros. I have yet to add the 16GB kits  yet because so far,it’s just OWC that offers these and there’s not much need to compare prices on 16GB RAM when only one memory vendor sells this very expensive RAM for MacBook Pros  so far.</p>

<p>The best deal is the 8GB memory upgrade kits for MacBook Pros that under $100 make it a no nonsense and cheap way to double the RAM in Apple’s newest MacBook Pros that require different memory than the 2008-2010 Apple MacBook Pros. The new MacBook Pros use DDR3 PC10600 1333MHz RAM which is a different memory type than the older MBP’s which used DDR3 1066 SDRAM sodimms for memory upgrades.  It should come as no surprise that the faster RAM combined with the faster i5 and i7 Intel processors in the MacBook Pro’s for 2011 result the fastest notebooks Apple has ever built to date with the 2011 MacBook Pro updates.</p>

<p>RAM Upgrades for the 2011 Apple MacBook Pros are available by <strong>upgrading the factory memory in the MacBook Pro</strong> with larger 4GB chips or the newest 8GB DDR3 1333MHz notebook memory modules, resulting in 4GB, 8GB, 12GB and 16GB upgrades available.</p>

<p>The  12GB memory upgrade kit seems to me to be the black sheep out of all the memory configurations. Due to the <strong>current cost of 8GB RAM modules</strong> for the MBP’s it makes sense to either buy the 8GB or 16GB memory upgrade kits. If you are going to upgrade the RAM, I have always felt that it’s best to do it by doubling the RAM you currently have. Yes, 12GB is still  more RAM than 8GB but due to the costs I would wait until those 8GB RAM chips drop in price, as they will.</p>

<p>One word: <strong>Don’t</strong>. You can get a much better <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="apple memory deal">deal on Apple Memory</a></strong></p>

<p>This is simple <strong>advice on memory upgrades</strong> if you are in the market to <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/">buy the cheapest RAM</a> for your Macintosh, in most cases you will not find it at <a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple</a>. The one and only reason why you might want to buy Apple RAM is if you value convenience over cost.<br />
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1146" title="Best Selling Apple RAM" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-24-at-1.55.27-PM.png" alt="Best Apple RAM Price" width="308" height="237" /></a></p>

**</p>

<p>You might be able to <strong>save some money on Apple RAM</strong> if you buy a Mac at the same time online from the Apple Store, as you could buy a Macintosh  Computer filled with RAM from Apple to the maximum capacity negating the need to replace the factory memory from Apple with bigger memory upgrade modules at a later date. This will save you some money if you buy a Mac at the same time.</p>

<p>Let’s investigate, and assume a new 13 inch MacBook Pro is the Apple computer you want to buy from Apple and fill it with 8GB of RAM – the maximum memory for MacBook Pro as advised from Apple (although the good <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/2011-apple-macbook-pro-16gb-memory-upgrades/">folks at OWC</a> will tell you otherwise):</p>

<p>**Cost for the 2011 13 inch 2.3 GHz MacBook Pro from Apple: $1199<br />
Cost for filling the MacBook with 8GB from Apple: additional $200. **</p>

<p>This brings a 13 inch MacBook Pro to $1399 with 8GB if you buy it from Apple.</p>

<p>Plan B would be to still <strong>buy the 13 inch MacBook Pro from Amazon and save a few bucks:</strong> <strong>$1194.00.</strong> Not much of a deal on a Mac Notebook but hey, five bucks is five bucks.</p>

<p>Now we go <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/shopping-advice-buy-memory-online-and-save-money/">ram shopping online</a> for the best ram deal on 8GB MacBook Pro RAM and at the time of writing 8GB memory upgrade kits can be bought from <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">Crucial Technology</a></strong> for just $97.00, which is not only considerably cheaper RAM than buying from Apple, but Crucial Technology is a well respected and trusted memory store that both makes, manufactures and supports the RAM you buy, and all for under $100 for MacBook Pro RAM.</p>

<p><strong>Total cost for a 13 inch 2.3GHz MacBook Pro with 8GB of RAM when you buy the MacBook Pro from Amazon and the RAM from Crucial: $1291.00</strong></p>

<p>So buying your MacBook Pro memory from a trusted and respected third party memory store you <strong>save over $100 on your MacBook Pro</strong>.</p>

<p>But this gets better: You still have the <strong>2x 2GB DDR3 1333 MHz RAM Upgrades</strong> that you pulled from your original MacBook Pro and if you choose to spend a few bucks more on MacBook Pro RAM.. let’s use OWC, as they will <a href="http://eshop.macsales.com/tech_center/support/rebates/memory.cfm">accept trade ins on your MacBook Memory</a> and will <strong>offer you $26 for your factory installed MacBook RAM.</strong></p>

<p>OWC charges $112.99 at time of writing for 8GB MacBook Pro RAM Kits. Subtract the $26.00 for the factory RAM trade in and your total cost for 8GB of RAM for 13 inch MacBook Pro drops to $86.99, which beats the Crucial RAM price and brings the <strong>total cost for a 13 inch MacBook Pro down another $11.00 to $1280.00</strong>. This ends up being savings of $120.00 when you compare against buying the same MacBook Pro from Apple Directly.</p>

<p>For some, <strong>the $120 savings on a 13 inch MacBook Pro</strong> is more than enough for you to decide to buy both the Apple notebook and the memory upgrades from a third party store. But for others, it’s not worth the $120 savings and you value convenience over cost and possibly: warranty issues.</p>

<p>When you buy both the Apple Macintosh and the <a href="http://store.apple.com/us/memoryfamily/ME_MBP">RAM directly from Apple</a>, in the slight chance that there is a problem with your new MacBook, it is possible Apple could blame the third party RAM as the problem with your Apple notebook, negating any  savings with the time you spend troubleshooting problems with your MacBook Pro.<br />
It’s up to you whether you choose to buy RAM direct from Apple Computer but be aware that when compared against other options for memory  upgrades that tend to be cheaper  the Apple Store memory upgrade will always be the most expensive memory you can buy.</p>

<p>This 16GB RAM upgrade is compatible with all Apple MacBook Pros that require 1600Mhz DDR3 SDRAM sodimms,and to get to the maximum of 16GB of RAM you will need to buy 8GBx2 as there are still only two memory upgrade slots available for RAM upgrades int the new MBP’s but if you either have bought a MacBook Pro or in the market to buy a MacBook Pro you should upgrade the RAM to at least the maximum that Apple recommends which is 8GB.</p>

<p>The best RAM upgrade for the MacBook Pro is the 16GB ram option, because if you are upgrading MacBook Pro memory you may as well do it right and do it once and <a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT102464BF160B%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT102464BF160B">buy 16GB of MacBook Pro RAM</a> if you can afford to.</p>

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p><strong>June, 2012-</strong> The Apple MacBook Pro models I wrote about below have now been discountinued and replaced with much faster and cheaper MacBook Pro Models: The 2012 Apple MacBook Pro lineup now consists of the Apple MacBook Pro in 13 and 15 inch versions and the MacBook Pro 15 inch with Retina Display.  The 17 inch MacBook Pro has been discontinued. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/mn/search/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;field-keywords=macbook%20pro&amp;url=search-alias%3Delectronics"> See the best prices on the new MacBook Pro models</a></p>

<p>The new Apple MacBook Pros are probably the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26scn%3D565108%26redirect%3Dtrue%26ref_%3Dsr_nr_scat_565108_ln%26keywords%3Dapple%2520macbook%2520pro%26qid%3D1299601244%26h%3D621aeae1df9a264b9a4a8f750f947f33fbff58f8%26rh%3Dn%253A565108%252Ck%253Aapple%2520macbook%2520pro&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">best Apple notebooks</a> ever to be released yet and offer not only faster processors but a new connectivity options with the Thunderbolt technology the next generation of input and output devices, according to Apple. HD Facetime, faster graphics and the fact that both the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BNHM0C?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000BNHM0C">15 inch</a> and 17 inch 2011 <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26x%3D0%26ref_%3Dnb_sb_noss%26y%3D0%26field-keywords%3Dmacbook%2520pro%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">Apple MacBook Pros</a></strong> round out the main and most notable upgrades for the MBP’s this year to date.</p>

<p>But if you are wanting to compare <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I">2.3 GHz MacBook Pros</a> versus 2.7 GHz MacBook Pros, you are limited to the 13 inch Apple MacBook Pro which is currently available in these two configurations, with the difference being $300 between the two models: 2.3GHz vs 2.7Ghz MacBook Pros</p>

<p>That’s the first question I would ask when deciding <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26x%3D0%26ref_%3Dnb_sb_noss%26y%3D0%26field-keywords%3Dmacbook%2520pro%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">what Apple MacBook Pro to buy</a></strong>, regardless of screen size or feature set.</p>

<p>Both models ship with the same <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">4GB DDR3 1333MHz RAM</a>, and the hard drive space is minimally larger – <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26x%3D0%26ref_%3Dnb_sb_noss%26y%3D0%26field-keywords%3Dmacbook%2520pro%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">320GB</a> versus <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26x%3D0%26ref_%3Dnb_sb_noss%26y%3D0%26field-keywords%3D500gb%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">500GB</a> hard drives when comparing the two 13 inch MacBook Pros leaving the faster processor vs the slower processor speed your main difference between the two 2011 13 inch MacBook Pro models.</p>

<p>Let’s assume you <strong>buy the 13 inch MacBook Pro</strong> directly from Apple and you don’t get any deals or any other MacBook Pro discounts. This means that excluding sales taxes and shipping the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I">13 inch 2.3GHz MacBook Pro</a> will cost you $1199 and the 13 inch 2.7 inch MacBook Pro will cost you $300 more at $1499.00. This, as I have noted in the past is a $300 price difference between the two.</p>

<p>Now, if money is not a concern, this is an easy question to answer: Buy the 2.7 inch MacBook Pro, but if you need the cheapest MacBook Pro currently ons sale then the cheap MacBook Pro is the better deal. You might also want to consider adding a warranty option to your MacBook  Pro and  ask yourself: is AppleCare worth it? Some may think the included one year warranty is all they need, while some might say portables demand extented warranty due to all the possibilities of things that can go wrong on your MacBook Pro</p>

<p>**What is your time worth?<br />
**<br />
We also need to consider what you plan on using the MacBook Pro for. If the intended use of the MacBook Pro (and this advice applies to any model) is for business the choice is easy: Buy the 13 inch 2.7MHz MBP. Assuming you keep the MacBook Pro for a year, which is a reasonable time frame to buy and use a new computer, the added cost for the higher end MacBook Pro works out to just pennies per day and not even a dollar a day more. The cost to own the 13 inch MacBook Pro works out to $4.10 per day, so if you make money with your MacBook Pro and it’s more than the measly four bucks, you will be more productive, which results in even more money being made. It would not be hard to make over $4.00 per day with any notebook – Apple or otherwise. I know I do. <img src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p>**What is your MacBook Budget?<br />
**<br />
But, what if you’re a consumer who wants a more powerful, modern and faster computer than the current MacBook lineup that’s getting a bit old and are considering buying a 13 inch MacBook Pro. And even though it is not the cheapest MacBook you can buy you can swing the $200 more for the<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I"> 2.3 GHz model, </a>but when yo consider that you are not using this MacBook Pro for business and more as a portable computer for cafes and the couch, the added $300 on top of the added $200 for the Pro version brings you to $500 more than the MacBook line and with another $500 you could buy two MacBooks or <a href="http:/http://www.ramseeker.com/?p=997">buy a MacBook</a> when you need a full sized keyboard with contemporary design but use that $500 surplus and buy a just released Apple iPad 2 with the same $1500 budget. For the consumer, the choice on what MacBook Pro to buy seems to me to be considerably tougher due to the fact that you have much more choices in how to spend your computer dollars. If you need to buy the cheapest Mac portable, then you should be looking at the MacBook line, but if you can afford it, I would <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/?p=997">buy the 2.3GHz MacBook Pro.</a> Yes, this is the more expensive option but with that extra $200 you get a faster, more modern Apple notebook that at first blush might be the more expensive choice, but you may get more use and enjoyment over time.</p>

<p>Where the current MacBook might indeed be the <strong>cheaper notebook</strong>, it will also age faster and although fast enough for almost every task your average consumer could want, the 13 inch Macbook Pro is the <strong>better MacBook deal</strong> and the MacBook I would buy unless you really cannot afford the extra $200.</p>

<p>What about MacBook Pro screen size?</p>

<p>One other factor to consider when buying a new MacBook Pro is not only price and processor speed – but LCD display size as well. At $1499 the 13 inch MacBook Pro is just $300 away from a <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BNHM0C?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000BNHM0C">15 inch Apple MacBook Pro</a></strong> at $1799, and with that added $300 to the overall cost of the 2.7GHz Macbook Pro 13 inch comes one thing that a lot of users value and that is screen real estate.</p>

<p>Not only do you get a <strong>bigger LCD display</strong> when you <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/">buy a 15 inch MacBook Pro</a>, but you get a bump in processing speed with the 15 inch MacBook Pro offering Intel quad core i7 processors vs the $1499 13 incher’s 2.7Ghz dual core Intel i5 processors. The quad core processors run slower at 2.0 GHz, and not all applications will take advantage of the added cores yet, but if you’re a professional that can uses the MacBook Pro and needs lots of windows open or menus visable, the 15 inch MacBook Pro might allow you to work faster for no other reason than there’s more screen real estate and pixels to use and take advantage of. The cheaper 15 inch MacBook Pro is definitely a MacBook Pro to consider if the 13 inch 2.7 Ghz is also on the list of the MacBook Pros you are considering buying.</p>

<p>To summarize, it’s not an easy decision to choose between the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I">2.3 Ghz</a> and 2.7 inch MacBook Pro when it comes time to buy a new Apple notebook but unless you really need the extra speed the .4 GHz and the 120 GB of extra hard drive space offers, it’s my opinion that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I">2011 2.3GHz 13 inch MacBook Pro </a>is the <strong>best deal on an Apple notebook computer</strong> available today.</p>

<p>**13 inch Apple MacBook Pro 2.7GHz<br />
**<br />
13 inch Apple MacBook Pro 2.7 GHz is the faster 13 inch MacBook Pro and offers a faster processor with a 2.7GHz Intel Core i7 processor and bigger hard drive at 500GB being the two main differences between the 2.3GHz and 2.7Ghz 13 inch MacBook Pro. All else stays the same as the cheapest MacBook Pro except for the price which is $300 more than the low end model with a MSRP of $1499.</p>

You may sacrifice a bit on portability when you compare the two models side by side but for some the 13 inch MacBook Pro is just too small a screen to work with</p>

</a> **</p>

<p>The cheaper 15 inch Apple MacBook Pro of the two Apple MacBook Pro models available in the 2011 MBP Pro lineup is the 15 inch 2.0 GHz model that boasts the following features as standard equipment:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A 2.0Ghz Quad Core Intel Core i7 Processor</li>
  <li>4GB 1333MHz DDR3 RAM</li>
  <li>500 GB 5400RPM Hard Drive</li>
  <li>Intel HD Graphics 3000 AMD Radeon HD 6490M with 256MB GDDR5</li>
  <li>Built in Battery lasting up to 7 hours</li>
</ol>

<p>All this is priced at just $1799, which is the suggested list price for the Apple MacBook Pro 15 inch 2.2GHz, but you can get a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BNHM0C?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000BNHM0C">better deal on the MacBook Pro</a> by shopping online from other various online stores for sales and deals as most others offer a bit better price on the 15 inch MacBook Pros than if you were to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BNHM0C?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000BNHM0C">buy a 15 inch MacBook Pro</a> from Apple.</p>

</a> **</p>

<p>The higher end 15 inch MacBook offers a faster processor and runs at 2.2 GHz using the same Intel i7 processor but just a tad faster for power users looking for the fastest 15 inch MacBook Pro Apple makes today. Other features on the 2.2GHz Apple MacBook Pro are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>4GB DDR3 1333MHz Memory</li>
  <li>Intel HD Graphics 3000</li>
  <li>AMD Radeon HD 6750M with 1GB GDDR5</li>
  <li>Built in Battery lasting up to 7 hours</li>
</ol>

<p>The processor is faster, the hard drive is bigger and the graphics card on the high end 15 inch MBP is much faster, and those are the main differences between the 2 MacBook Pro 15 inch models save for the price which is listed as $2199 when you buy a MacBook Pro from Apple, but I you can get a better MacBook Pro 15 inch Price shopping online from other online stores and resources.</p>

The 2.2 GHz is the same speed with the same processor than the 15 inch 2.2 GHz MacBook Pro but the 17 incher offers much more real estate in the screen dept. Priced at another $300 more than the 15 inch model but all other specifications being the same it will be up to you whether you deem the added 2 inches of display space to be worth the extra costs.</p>

<p>Apple has come out with an impressive MacBook Pro lineup, but I’m surprised that the maximum memory is not 16GB on these professional Apple notebooks, as the iMac ha been boasting a 16GB ram maximum for some time now. Perhaps this is on purpose so as not to cannibalize the iMac sales, or more likely the technology or space just isn’t there yet. 8GB ram modules in DDR3 1333Mhz would be cost prohibitive at this point anyway so maybe Apple’s on the right track with this latest MacBook Pro lineup.</p>

<p>**What’s new on all MacBook Pros for 2011<br />
**</p>

<p>A slew of new features across the board make the 2011 Apple MacBook Pros a best buy this year when it comes to the new professional MacBooks:</p>

<p>**Faster Processors<br />
**</p>

<p>Starting with the 13 inch MacBook Pro, the slowest MacBook Pro of the bunch still offer dual core Intel i5 Processors and the 15 inch and 17 inch MacBook Pros offer quad core i7 processors making the the newest Apple MacBooks up to twice as fast as the previous models.</p>

<p>**ThunderBolt<br />
**<br />
Thunderbolt is new technology from Apple introduced first on the MacBook Pro lineup that allows you to use one connector running at up to 10MBps to connect both external peripherals and displays as well, offering less cables and faster speeds when communicating with external devices. USB just got old.</p>

<p>**Faster Graphics<br />
** Newer graphics cards with up to 1GB of RAM eliminate any bottleneck in the processing of graphics. Perfect for grapics professionals such as those using Aperture 3 or Adobe Photoshop.</p>

<p>**HD Face Time<br />
**</p>

<p>Face Time, Apple’s full screen video call technology goes HD that are sharper and more crisp than the video produced in previous MacBook Pro models</p>

<p>Included when you buy any new MacBook Pro model in 2011 is the MacBook Pro portable computer, the Magsafe Power Adapter, wall plug and power cord and included software dvds and a display polishing cloth to keep your new MacBook Display like the day you bought it.</p>

<p>Lastly the MacBook Pro models, regardless of screen size come with Mac OS Snow Leopard and iLife ’11 which includes iPhoto, iMove, GarageBand, iWeb and iDVD which all allow you to control, create and discover your photos, movies, and music on Apple’s new MacBook Pro professional notebook computers.</p>

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p> <br />
I am now tracking and monitoring memory upgrade prices for the new Apple MacBook Pro models released today and as I write this there are just two memory stores who ship and stock RAM upgrades for the 2011 Apple MacBook Pros. Seeing as how the new MacBook Pro models were released just a few hours ago that the two memory stores that tend to specialize in Apple memory are the first to announce and list memory prices online for the new Apple MacBook Pro Models, those two memory sellers being <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/ramjet">RAMJET</a> and OWC.<br />
[table id=1 /]<strong>Update</strong>: I have added memory prices for MacBook Pro 2011 RAM prices for the newest MacBook Pro models from the the following memory stores: <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">Crucial Technology,</a> <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/dms">Data Memory Systems</a> and <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memoryx">MemoryX</a></p>

<div>
</div>

<p>I have created two pages for the 2011 MacBook Pro’s as like always over the years if you’re in the market for the best prices on MacBook Pro RAM you need to check for both <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_Pro_DDR3_1333Mhz_Memory_Upgrades-4gb/">4GB MacBook Pro DDR3 Memory Modules</a> as well as <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_Pro_DDR3_1333Mhz_Memory_Upgrade_Kits-8gb/">8GB MacBook Pro Memory Upgrade Kits</a> as some stores only ship modules and others carry only the kits so be sure to check both for the best deal on 2011 MacBook Pro Memory Upgrades.</p>

<p>I’m surprised Apple didn’t bump the maximum memory on the 2011 MacBook Pros to a maximum of 16GB as this is what the new Apple iMacs can handle for almost a year now so I really assumed that 16GB of RAM for the MacBook Pros would be the default.</p>

<p>The new DDR3 MacBook Pro RAM for the 2011 MacBook Pros is compatible with the current Apple MacBook Computers and that’s for all versions – 13 inch to 17 inch models.</p>

The day of the release of the new MacBook Pro, Ramjet is the first memory vendor to offer the compatible DDR3-1333 RAM upgrades. Two upgrade options are available. The 4GB single SO-DIMM upgrades the MacBook Pro to 6GB, and an 8GB Kit (2x 4GB modules) which brings the MacBook up to its 8GB memory maximum.</p>

<p>The prices are significantly lower than the Apple price, with the <a href="http://www.ramjet.com/macbook.asp#BlackBezel" title="macbook memory">4GB module at $89.99,</a> and the <a href="http://www.ramjet.com/macbook.asp#BlackBezel" title="8GB macbook pro RAM">8GB kit at $149.99</a>. There is also a $40 trade-in rebate for the original 4GB that comes with the machine, which brings the total cost down to $109.99 for the 8GB upgrade.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2011/01/when-will-i-be-able-to-buy-an-under-700-ultrabook/">When Will I Be Able To Buy An Under $700 Ultrabook?</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p><strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/acers3.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4100" title="acers3 deal" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/acers3.jpg" alt="best deal on Acer S3" width="300" height="300" /></a><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/save-100-off-an-acer-s3-ultrabook/" title="Save $100 off an Acer S3 UltraBook">A deal on an Acer ultrabook  I found today</a></strong> reminded me of  a question I wanted to ask, and that’s <strong>when you think we will see a small portable computer with similar features of the  Apple MacBook  Air, but for about half the price</strong>? My guess is in about six months or so from now, maybe in time for back to school in 2012.</p>

<p>Let’s face it. If you want to buy the<strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/pc/541966/?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957"> best computer online today you buy an Apple notebook</a></strong>.  If you don’t believe me, just have a look at the best selling notebooks at Amazon where 7 out of ten best sellers in the laptop department are Apple notebooks –  not windows PC’s.</p>

<p>But for the rest of us who actually work for every penny we spend, the opportunity to buy an Ultrabook at half the price of an Apple product is too great to ignore for some of us. At least it is for yours truly. I would love to buy a brand  new 2012 Apple MacBook  Air  if and when they are released but when you can get pretty much the same computer capable of the same tasks for half the price, one  might argue in favor of the Windows machine.</p>

<p><strong>UltraBooks Cost Too Much</strong></p>

<p>The problem with the first generation ultrabooks, and to some extent some of  the new 2012 ultra’s, is that at current retail prices they are too close to the price of an Apple MacBook Air for me to be willing to put up with the Windows experience when  can buy a MacBook Air for about the same dough.</p>

<p>For a comparison of Ultrabooks vs MacBook Air’s, I am not going to compare every last detail as there are differnces in the technical specs, but in my mind there’s two reasons to buy this new brand of notebook computer: size and weight, and hard drive speed thanks to the solid state hard drives included in these.</p>

<p>A 13.3. inch Apple Ultrabook costs just over $1100 on sale at Amazon and  the <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005MR58MG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B005MR58MG">Acer Aspire S3 costs $799</a></strong> from a variety of online vendors  including Amazon.</p>

<p>The Air has features the S3 doesn’t have but they both offer SSD hard drives and light weight at about 3lbs each. The difference for the  most part is operating system and $300. As I write this, I might be tempted to go with the MacBook Air  – assuming I can find the price difference.</p>

<p>Unless I really needed to buy an UltraBook today, I would wait until we see a half price ultrabook. By half price, I don’t mean half the pric of regular price, but at a price point where I can buy two ultrabooks for the price  of one MacBook Air and currently that means there has to be a $550 Ultrabook for these lightweight windows notebooks to really take off.</p>

<p>To be fair, it’s hard to buy a full featured notebook for that price, so let’s offer a little wiggle room and say that for me  to  buy a PC ultrabook over a MacBook Air  the ultrabooks need to drop  in price to the $500-$700 range. All that’s stopping them is the cost of the solid state drive, and with SSD drives continuing to fall it’s just a matter of  time before this happens.</p>

<p>We’re off to a good start with a $100 off Ultrabooks startin to appear, we just need to see the prices drop another hundred dollars at least for these small notebooks to start selling in quantity.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2011/01/cheap-macbook-ram/">Cheap Mac RAM for Apple MacBook Computers</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com">MacBook memory,</a> or MacBook RAM as it is commonly known is in my opinion the very best upgrade you can do on an Apple MacBook. It’s a better upgrade than hard drives, or even software and the best part is that in 2011 MacBook RAM is cheap, in fact, cheaper than it’s ever been in years. Only a few short months ago to max out the ram on a MacBook would cost upwards of one hundred dollars, but now in earkly 2011 the very same DDR3 ram upgrade consisting of a 4GB MacBook RAM kit can be bought for as little as $48.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1136" title="Best Price MacBook Pro" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-24-at-7.39.14-AM.png" alt="See Best Price on MacBook Pro" width="283" height="223" /></a></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I">Cheapest MacBook Pro: 13 Inch MacBook Pro</a></strong></p>

<p>The MacBook lineup has been refreshed by Apple over the years but the same design hasn’t changed much and the MacBook only accepts two different types of memory upgrades: For older MacBook models such as the Intel Core Processor MacBooks and even some Intel Core 2 processor MacBooks the memory required for these older MacBook model are DDR2 PC5300 DDR sodimms and although not required, it’s recommended that you install the MacBook Memory in pairs.</p>

<p>Some memory vendors suggest that more memory than Apple suggests can be installed in a MacBook and it may very be possible, I recommend you stick to what the maximum RAM for MacBook as suggested by Apple.. For older MacBooks requiring DDR2 RAM that max out at 2GB of memory, it has been suggested that 3GB of RAM will run fine in these Apple notebooks and for those MacBooks that max out at 4GB, it’s been suggested that 6GB of memory will run fine. This could be the case, as when the older MacBooks were released, the larger 2GB and 4GB memory chips were not available.</p>

<p>For the newer UniBody MacBook models, these run a faster motherboard speed at twice as fast as the older MacBooks and require DDR3 memory upgrades running at 1066Mhz. The newer MacBook models max out at 4GB of DDR3 RAM which is more than enough memory for most applications.</p>

<p>Buying MacBook Memory is a fine balance: You can buy the MacBook RAM directly from Apple either when you buy the MacBook, or you can purchase memory from Apple at a later date. Warranty will be no problem as you have Apple memory installed in an Apple product. But, and this is big: RAM from Apple will not be cheap.</p>

<p>What I suggest is buying ram for MacBooks from a trusted third party vendor that offer the same warranty and support as with Apple products, but without the inflated price tag that comes with the RAM when you buy from Apple directly.</p>

<p>Memory for MacBook can either be the cheapest MacBook RAM you can buy, or if you prefer you can spend a few more dollars and buy name brand memory from a vendor such as Crucial Technology. When shopping for RAM, the cheapest RAM is going to be generic RAM, which for most applications is just fine and still manufactured and tested to the Apple Specifications that the MacBook requires when it comes to RAM upgrades.</p>

<p>**Cheapest MacBook RAM Prices<br />
**<br />
I have created a table or chart of the cheapest MacBook RAM prices from a select few memory stores I can recommend that sell a quality memory product at a fair price: This list of MacBook memory prices change so you will always be sure to get the best prices on RAM for MacBook, regardless of what specific MacBook you have.</p>

<p>There was a time when Apple just had one product  and that was the Apple Macintosh computer, but with the Mac now available in so many different flavors not to mention tablet computers like the Apple iPad and MP3 players such as the iPod – the selection can be a bit overwhelming for both the Brand New Apple computer user and professional alike.</p>

		<div class="post-content"><p>Cheapest Mac Pro RAM Prices.</p>

<p>Below are the current and cheapest prices on Mac Pro Memory from a wide selection of memory stores that you can trust to get a good deal on Mac Pro Memory.</p>

<p>[table id=15 /]</p>

<p>Cheap Mac Pro RAM (or, Mac Pro Memory) may not be the best deal on Mac Pro RAM as you think it might be if you set the value of cheap just on price alone. I know, I compare prices on Mac Pro memory so this might seem as if I am contradicting myself, but all I have done and continue to do is look for the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com">best Mac Pro RAM Prices</a>. I never really suggest that you buy Mac Pro RAM from one vendor or another as I feel it’s your hard earned money so you get to decide where to buy Mac Pro Memory.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ZR4M6I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B003ZR4M6I">Cheapest Mac Pro</a></strong></p>

<p>But Cheap RAM for Mac Pros should not be the only requirement for shopping for Mac Pro memory upgrades. The Apple Mac Pro is not a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fbestsellers%2Fpc%2F565098%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref_%3Dpd_ts_zgc_pc_565098_mor1&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">cheap computer</a> and in fact, it’s the most expensive desktop Mac you can buy and when it comes to ram upgrades for Apple Mac Pros, the RAM is anything but cheap.</p>

<p>That said, in the six months or so since the latest Apple Mac Pros were released (we’ll call them mid 2010 models) you can now install up to 64GB of RAM into the latest Mac Pro models and Mac Pro memory prices have dropped significantly over the past six months. Case in point – 64GB of Mac Pro RAM in the summer of 2010 would cost you just over $3000. Today in early 2011, that same memory upgrade from the same memory store costs as little as $1800. That’s getting close to half price for Mac Pro memory in just a few months.</p>

<p>If you need more memory to get work done, then buy ram now and be happy that you have the fastest Mac Pro possible (assuming you are maxing out your Mac Pro with 64GB) and don’t worry about the cost. The cheapest RAM or savings from buying the cheapest RAM may sound like a good deal on memory but you might be better off with name brand ram or at very least buying Mac Pro Memory from a memory store you can trust.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2011/01/cheap-mac-mini-ram/">Cheap Mac Mini RAM</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>To get the maximum performance out of the Mac Mini, you can and should install more RAM in the Mac Mini (here’s the instructions from Apple on <a href="http://manuals.info.apple.com/en_US/Mac_mini_Mid2010_User_Guide.pdf">how to install Mac Mini RAM</a>) you want page 34. You can install 8GB of DDR3 1066 SDRAM in the latest Apple Mac Mini and I recommend that you do as Mac Mini RAM is cheap, in fact memory upgrades for any Apple Computer is a great deal right now and the cheapest it’s been is some time. Now is the time to buy ram. regardless of whether it’s for The Mac Mini, any other Mac or even a PC such as a HP notebook computer.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013FK9U2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0013FK9U2">Cheapest Mac Mini</a></strong>The Apple Mac Mini is the <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013FK9U2?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0013FK9U2">cheapest Apple computer</a></strong> you can buy in 2011. (and, it’s on sale too). But one thing that will make this little wonder even better would be to max out the memory on the Apple Mac Mini.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Installing the RAM on the newest Mac Mini couldn’t be easier – all you do is flip the Mac Mini over, twist the cover like you would on a jar of peanut butter and the RAM and memory slots are right there. Apple does suggest that you have an Apple certified technician install the memory upgrade on a Mac Mini but I don’t think that’s needed at all if you’re careful with static electricity you should be fine. But be aware that if something does go wrong installin memory by yourself, your warranty on your new Mac Mini could be voided.</p>

<p>To remove the original RAM on a Mac Mini, there’s two little clips that hold the memory module down – seperate these and the memory module pops up at a 45 degree angle (or thereabouts) and you gently remove the memory from the memory upgrade slot. You repeat this for the second memory upgrade module that’s directly below and then you have to empty memory upgrade slots that are now free to use 4GB DDR3 SDRAM x 2 to get you to the maximum of 8GB of memory allowed on the latest Mac Mini models. (older mac mini’s were not as easy to install memory in, so if you’re in the market for RAM for a discontinued Mac Mini you might be best to find either an apple certified technician to install the memory for you, or if the warranty on the Mac Mini is long gone you might want to chance installing the RAM yourself.</p>

<p><strong>Where to Buy Mac Mini RAM Cheap</strong></p>

<p>As I mentioned above, Mac mini ram is the cheapest it’s ever been and you can buy much cheaper RAM from a selection of memory stores that I can recommend as being quality places to buy memory from. Below is a chart of the current <strong>best and cheapest ram for Apple Mac Mini</strong>.</p>

<p>The iMac, in my opinion is probably the best value in an Apple Personal Computer, regardless of year. From the very first Apple iMac to the current Apple iMacs with Intel i3 and i5 processors, with the Apple iMac you get a well designed desktop computer that in it’s latest incarnation with the summer 2010 refresh also offers you a choice of processor speeds, screen sizes and price points but they all offer the same sleek design that hardly takes any room on your desktop.</p>

<p>One thing that the latest iMacs need (and with RAM so cheap these days, I don’t understand why Apple doesn’t ship the Apple iMac’s full of RAM) is more RAM. For a select few, the memory installed at the factory will be more than ample if you’re just surfing facebook or email or the like, but for the rest of us that want to get the most performance we can out of Apple’s best selling desktop computer, adding more memory is the cheapest way to do that and usually offers more bang per buck than adding hard drives or installing software could.</p>

<p>The best part about iMac memory upgrades, is that if you do it right you only do it once and the memory upgrade is good for the life of the computer. Fill your iMac with RAM, and forget about it. You can buy ram from Apple for the iMac, but even though more moderately priced than earlier years buying RAM direct from Apple is still a pricey proposition.</p>

<p>A better, and cheaper option is to buy iMac Memory from a memory store you can trust to offer the same technical specs required for the 2010 Apple iMacs but at a cheaper price. Most memory stores offer a lifetime guarantee free shipping and support in the rare case you do have trouble with your iMac RAM you know you will get the help you need. This is rarely needed as the memory shops test the RAM upgrades prior to shipping.</p>

<p>**Where to Buy iMac RAM and for the Cheapest Price.<br />
**</p>

<p>I don’t recommend any one specific memory store as I figure it’s your money you’re spending and you have different requirements about how much you will pay for ram, but also the perceived value attached with <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">brand name memory</a> and other factors to consider when buying RAM. But, most of you just want the cheapest iMac RAM and I have created a chart that lists the lowest memory prices from memory vendors you can trust.</p>

<p>The title of this article could be misunderstood or misread and that’s not what we want. To clarify: RAM or memory is a physical product. RAM is not a software upgrade or downloadable online. But, you can save a lot of money buying RAM online from a selection of online memory stores and it’s been my goal over the past ten years or so to help you get the best deal you can on memory upgrades, regardless of whether you need to buy RAM for your Apple, HP or Dell computer, just to name a few computer manufacturers and their products that will run much much faster when you add more memory.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001KB6Z2U/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001KB6Z2U"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1139" title="Best Selling Computer RAM" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-24-at-1.41.59-PM.png" alt="" width="312" height="292" /></a></p>

<p>I’m going to assume you are in the market to save money on memory and RAM and want a fair price from a memory store you can trust to sell and ship you RAM upgrades fast and without any fuss or trouble. With RAM, there can be huge markups, especially when buying ram from the manufacturer directly, such as Dell or HP or even Apple. It’s convenient to buy memory from the computer manufacturer, but accessories are expensive and unless time is more important to you than money (which could be the case) it’s ill advised.</p>

<p>Your best bet when it comes to low priced ram upgrades is to buy RAM online from a trusted third party memory store. You will see to the right of this article that I have a list of the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com">best memory stores</a> and if that’s not a big enough list of options I have even <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/where-to-buy-computer-memory-upgrades/">more memory sellers</a> you can choose from when you’re looking for the best price on your memory upgrades.</p>

<p>In most cases, the cheapest ram will be generic memory as opposed to name brand RAM upgrades. The difference between the two in most cases, besides ram prices – is the name brand RAM might be considered the better RAM due to the name, but that’s debatable and the generic memory upgrades are still made and tested to the computer manufacturers exact specifications, so in most cases you will be just fine by ordering generic RAM and saving money the next time you need to upgrade your notebook or desktop computer.</p>

<p>What do you get when you combine the best selling Apple MacBook with the most RAM or memory you can install in a current shipping MacBook Pro? A small, powerful – and thanks in part to the 8GB of RAM that maxes out the 13.3 inch MacBook Pro – notebook computer from Apple that has the most ram possible installed and in most cases, for less than $100 for MacBook Pro 8GB<br />
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1149" title="Cheapest MacBook Pro" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-24-at-7.39.14-AM1.png" alt="Best MacBook Pro Price" width="283" height="223" /></a></p>

<p>You can even offset the the cost of 8GB MacBook Pro RAM by selling your old, or original memory that came installed in the MacBook Pro 13 inch back to <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/oempcworld">some</a> <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/ramjet">memory</a> <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memoryx">manufacturers</a> who will take your older memory in as a trade where you offset the cost and get 8GB RAM for MacBook Pro even cheaper than you could if you bought the RAM</p>

<p>To max out the 13 inch MBP, you need to remove (in most cases) the 2 x 2GB memory modules in the two memory upgrade slots and replace them with 2x 4GB RAM for MacBook Pro. There’s quite a selection of best memory stores (see sidebar) to buy MacBook RAM from but to get the best price you should compare prices on both 4GB memory modules for MacBook Pro and also 8GB memory upgrade kits too as some stores only market their memory upgrades as ram modules, while others prefer to sell you a 8GB MacBook RAM Upgrade KIT which consists of two 4GB DDR3 1066 SDRAM memory modules for MacBook Pro</p>

<p>Stores I recommend for memory upgrades are <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">Crucial</a>, <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/OWC">OWC</a>, <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/dms">Data Memory Systems</a>, <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/1800">18004Memory</a>, <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memoryx">MemoryX</a> and <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/oempcworld">OEMPCWORLD</a></p>

<p>There’s other memory stores but over the 14 yeas of tracking memory upgrades I find that these few stores support and sell quality Apple Memory Upgrades for less than what you would pay if you were to buy the RAM from Apple, which while convenient sometimes – is not the best way to save money on ram upgrades.</p>

<p>In 2011, it does not cost a lot of money for <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">apple memory upgrades</a>, and in fact now is the perfect time to buy mac memory as RAM has never been cheaper than right now for Apple Computers.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1146" title="Best Selling Apple RAM" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-24-at-1.55.27-PM.png" alt="Best Apple RAM Price" width="308" height="237" /></a></p>

<p>Let’s take a look at today’s RAM prices: As I write this you can <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">buy memory for MacBook Pros</a> for as little as $49 for 4GB of MacBook Pro memory, one of the best selling Apple notebooks available today. To maximize current memory on any modern MacBook Pro will need to replace the 4GB that ships as standard equipment when the MacBook Pro comes from Apple and replace it with 4GB memory modules x 2 for a total of 8GB of MacBook Pro RAM. To offset the cost of your MacBook Pro RAM there are many memory stores that will <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/oempcworld">buy back</a> your <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/ramjet">old ram</a> and and credit you against the newer and larger memory upgrades – regardless of which Apple computer you need RAM for and making the memory for your Apple Computer even that much cheaper. It’s possible you could <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com">upgrade the RAM on your Mac</a> for under $50 for most current shipping Apple computers – and even less if you’re looking to upgrade older Macs with cheaper and smaller ram modules.</p>

<p>When it comes to upgrading the memory on older Macintosh computers, you do need to be aware of the price and performance ratio, as some older Macs might not be worth it to add more memory to. Your computing dollar might be better spent on buying a new Mac, rather than upgrading the memory on an old computer where your performance dollar might be better spent.</p>

<p>Below are the best prices on Apple RAM for all current Apple computers such as Apple iMac, MacBook, MacBook Pro and Mac Pro</p>

<p><strong>Best and Cheapest RAM for MacBook Pro</strong></p>

<p>The Apple MacBook Pro might just very well be the most popular Apple computer made by Apple to date. Yes, it is priced more than the MacBook as the professional version of Apple’s notebook computer offers more features and benefits of the MacBook Pro. I won’t compare the MacBook against the MacBook Pro with this article as that’s not the point but the MacBook Pros do offer larger screen size, faster processor speeds and in my opinion, what is probabl the most important feature: the ability to add more RAM for even faster performance.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1149" title="Cheapest MacBook Pro" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-24-at-7.39.14-AM1.png" alt="Best MacBook Pro Price" width="283" height="223" /></a></p>

<p>It makes no sense to me why you would buy the best notebook computer from Apple and then just leave it sit there with the RAM that came from the factory, when for under $100 you could maximize the performance of your MacBook Pro. This advice applies to both the latest and greatest MacBook Pros to the older MacBook Pros too that are just fine for simpler tasks like email, text editing and even <a href="http://www.facebook.com">surfing facebook</a> if that’s your thing.</p>

<p>RAM Prices for Apple MacBook Pros are cheap and get a bit cheaper every day it seems and for less than a dinner out you can maximize the performance on your professional Apple Computer.</p>

<p>The MacBook, from Apple could arguably be the best notebook computer available today from Apple, as this consumer based laptop offers a small footprint and price/performance ratio that can’t be beat when compared to the big brother in the Apple lineup: The Apple MacBook Pro.</p>

<p>But for most consumers this small laptop is the perfect choice as the digital hub between your iPhone, iPod, and any other consumer electronic item – such as a digital camera. Most buyers of the Apple MacBook should upgrade the memory at time of purchase, and I recommend that unless you have money to burn that you save money on memory upgrades and buy ram from a cheaper third party, and since on the internet, price is king – I have gathered and created a chart of current ram prices for both new and old Apple MacBook models. The older MacBook models, up to about 2007 require and use PC5300 DDR2 SDRAM sodimms, while the later unibody macbooks can accept a much faster memory upgrade in the form of DDR3 1066mhz SDRAM sodimms.</p>

<p>Depending on the specific MacBook model you have you might be able to install either 2 or 4GB or memory as the maximum RAM amount – and on the older MacBook models it’s quite possbile to squeeze 3GB or 6GB in them although this is not supported by Apple and I cannot recommend this MacBook memory upgrade.</p>

<p>The Apple iMac has long been a top selling Apple Computer and one of the best methods to maximize or accelerate the performance of your Apple iMac is to add memory. One of the challenges when shopping for ram is where to buy Mac Memory? This is the question I answer all day, each and every day and so in the interest of answering your questions on where to buy cheap Apple memory for the iMac, I have put together this handy little chart below which will show you the current lowest price on RAM Memory for the different Apple iMac models. This is all the iMac models too, from the very first iMac running at 333Mhz to the latest iMacs in 2011 which now operate at ten times the speed of the original iMac.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com">best prices on RAM</a>. If there is a theme here at ramseeker it is that it’s my goal to help you get the best deal on RAM that you can. Yes, memory has dropped in price in recent times but it still costs money to upgrade your desktop or notebook computer, and in most cases it is your hard earned money you’re spending on RAM so of course you want to find the cheapest RAM price you can find when it comes to ram upgrades for either your notebook or desktop computer, and I can help.</p>

<p>What you need when it comes to shopping for memory upgrades is the right upgrade at the best price. That’s it. It’s nice to shop for name brand memory but it’s not needed unless you’re doing mission critical work with your computer, but for the most of us we’re just surfing the internet, or some other task such as <a href="http://www.facebook.com">facebook</a> and using generic memory upgrades when shopping for RAM.</p>

<p>Why you want to look out for generic RAM as opposed to name brand memory is that for the most part – save for the little sticker on the ram module, there’s not a whole lot of difference between the two, except the price and it’s always been my policy to list the lowest price available for memory upgrades from the various memory manufacturers or resellers regardless of whether the memory is name brand or generic. If there’s an option, I have always tracked memory prices for generic ram as in most cases, generic memory is cheaper.</p>

Rather than list the lowest ram prices here I will direct you to a page that lists <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/where-to-buy-computer-memory-upgrades/">memory stores</a> you can <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com">buy ram </a>from and you can make the choice yourself, or you can search for the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/#lowest">cheapest apple memory</a> or <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/pc/index.php#lowest">cheapest PC memory</a> too.</p>

<p>The short answer is: <strong>NO</strong></p>

<p>You cannot put faster memory upgrades into an old MacBook. You might be able to add more memory to your Macbook depending on your specific Apple Macbook you’re in the market to upgrade, but no – you cannot add faster ram. Adding more RAM, yes you can – assuming you have not maxed out the MacBook RAM already on your Apple MacBook.</p>

<p>MacBook Memory comes in two flavors currently: DDR2 PC5300 sdram sodimms, and DDR3 SDRAM sodimms running at 1066MHz, which if you notice, is twice as fast as the older macbook ram. For the older macbook models, the maximum memory you can apply again depends on both who you talk to and what exact older macbook you have. Some memory stores like <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/OWC">OWC</a>, will state that on the MacBook models where 2GB is the maximum RAM you can squeek another 1GB of RAM into the old MacBook by installing a 1GB memory upgrade for MacBook in the first slot and a 2GB memory upgrade module in the second slot. It’s always to suggest what Apple suggests, and leave the overclocking and other performance tweaks to others. If you are insterested in squeezing every last drop of performance out of your Apple computer <a href="http://www.xlr8yourmac.com">accelerate your mac</a> is a great resource about speeding up your MacBook</p>

<p>The same goes for the slightly newer MacBooks that maxed out at 4GB PC5300 DDR2 sdram sodimms : word on the street is you could effectively install 6GB of RAM into these older MacBooks, and it’s been reported to work just fine, but I can’t recommend doing this, if Apple states that 4GB is the maximum MacBook RAM, then that’s what I state and list as the MacBook maximum ram limit.</p>

<p>By theory, you should be OK with more RAM than officially stated, due in part that when the older MacBooks were released, the larger memory sizes were not released yet so the maximum memory stated was in part due to the biggest RAM upgrade available for MacBook at the time. But still, I list what Apple states as the maximum memory allowable.</p>

		<div class="post-content"><p>I’m not really looking to start a Mac vs PC discussion with this post, but I was asked this today and of course I am completely biased, as I grew up with the Mac so I just learned to be a died in the wool Apple Mac user and fan. I’d pick the iMac, without a doubt.</p>

<div style="float: right; margin-right: 5px;">
</div>

<p>But there’s lots of you out there that would disagree and one of the benefits over the Apple iMac when shopping for an all in one HP is that the HP computers sure are cheaper. The title of this article states HP desktop but to be fair I think a HP branded all in one computer needs to be compared to Apple’s all in one computer: the Apple iMac.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8IO6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8IO6">Best Price on Apple iMac</a></strong></p>

<p>On the HP website, the cheapest HP branded (there’s a cheaper compaq computer but it’s not an HP) all in one PC is currently the HP Omni 100z series Standard features included Windows 7 premium 64 bit. AMD Athlon II processor running at 2.0GHz, 2GB of DDR3 1066 SDRAM, 500GB hard drive, 20 inch LCD display and a wireless card which should come as standard equipment on anything. Heck, my phone and many other cellular phones can use wi-fi. This HP computer sells for $449.00</p>

<p> </p>

<p>On the Apple site, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;field-keywords=imac&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;linkId=2M6BG7UFW75WM6QM">cheapest Apple iMac</a> you can buy is $1199.00 which even without digging deeper on the Apple iMac’s specifications you can tell that the iMac cost significantly more than the all in one offering from HP. You could buy close to three HP computers for the same price as the low end iMac.</p>

<p>The Apple iMac does ship with a bigger LCD display and comes with a faster processor running a 3.06 GHz using dual core i3 processors. The iMac also ships standard with twice as much RAM as the low priced HP computer and also includes wi-fi.</p>

<p>The Apple is also more compatible with most other Apple products, as it’s all in the family but the HP can connect to Apple iPods and the like too.</p>

<p>So the decision on what is the best might come down to budget. At just over $400, the HP computer sure is a bargain for an all in one computer. The iMac on the other hand has a bigger screen, faster processor and we won’t even get into comparing Apple vs Windows operating systems.</p>

<p>So. On a Budget? HP wins for a cheap all in one. If you want a Mac be prepared to spend considerably more but you get more speed in the form of ram and processor. The choice, ultimately is yours to make on whether you <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26x%3D0%26ref_%3Dnb_sb_noss%26y%3D0%26field-keywords%3Dhp%2520desktop%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957"><strong>buy a HP desktop&lt;</strong></a> or an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26x%3D0%26ref_%3Dnb_sb_noss%26y%3D0%26field-keywords%3Dhp%2520desktop%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957"><strong>Apple desktop computer</strong></a>.</p>

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>Most, when looking for memory upgrades for their computers tend to associate the best computer ram with the cheapest computer RAM and the two don’t mean the same thing in most cases. You can buy cheap RAM from a long list of <a href="http://www.memoryseller.com">memory sellers</a>. Heck, in an afternoon I could set up a ram memory store and sell you memory, but retail is not one of my strong points so I’ll stick to helping you get the best deal on RAM and let the others specialize in selling RAM.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW">Best Selling Apple Computer RAM</a> </strong>The <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/AMZ_MacBookPro">best place to buy RAM, or computer</a> <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com">memory</a>, or random access memory, as it is known to be called or RAM for short is from an honest <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">computer memory store</a> that offers you a good fair price on memory upgrades and offers you the option to return or exchange your memory upgrad in the slight chance that you might have a problem with your laptop upgrade.</p>

<p>So, where to Buy RAM? I compare and monitor memory prices from a select few memory stores who meet my qualification as to what a good memory store should be, and that’s they should offer a fair price on RAM upgrades for either your Mac or PC computer. I tend to lean towards the Apple computer and am more familiar with Apple Memory such as iMac Memory or MacBook memory, but this is the year I change this and my goal is to help you get the best deal possible on RAM regardless of whether you are a Mac OS or Windows user.</p>

<p>Another resource for buying RAM and where to buy Memory is the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/where-to-buy-computer-memory-upgrades/">list of memory stores</a> I have created to help you determine where you want to buy RAM from. RAM prices change, (lately, they’ve been dropping) so you should take some time to get the best deal on ram upgrades because I have found in the years I have been tracking memory that different memory shops have different ideas on the what the definition of lowest price ram means.</p>

<p>If you’ve been a visitor to ramseeker in the past, it should come as no surprise that I <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com">specialize in Apple memory</a> moreso than the PC brands, in part due to the fact that a: I’m drinking the Apple Koolaid and am a true blue Apple fan but also the model numbers and names for most PC desktops and notebooks are quite many, compared to the Apple computers which essentially come in both portable and desktop solutions for consumer and business totaling up the entire Apple computer lineup in just 4 models.</p>

<p>But in 2011, the goal is to change this and widen my scope to include not only <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/pc">HP Memory Prices</a> but Dell, Sony an other computer manufacturers so today I thought it would be a good idea to familiarize myself with the current HP linuep and for today, we’ll start with notebooks, as they tend to be the more popular computer type over desktop models.</p>

<p>The HP notebook lineup in 2011 is currently broken down to 5 different notebook computer types:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004FYYGD4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004FYYGD4"><img title="Best Priced HP Notebook" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-6.59.41-AM.png" alt="Best Deal on HP Notebooks" width="305" height="270" /></a></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004FYYGD4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004FYYGD4">Best Priced HP Notebook</a></strong></p>

<p>**HP Mini Netbooks<br />
HP Everyday Notebooks<br />
HP Ultra Portable Notebooks<br />
HP High Performance Notebooks<br />
HP Envy Notebooks<br />
**</p>

<p>Each and every one of these notebooks can benefit from a computer memory upgrade, and in later articles I want to explore each notebook model from HP seperately and help you find the best deal on a memory upgrade for your HP notebook, but for today what I can do is suggest a few ways to upgrade HP memory and where to get the best price on memory for HP too.</p>

<p>You have three options when it comes to memory upgrades for HP notebooks and desktops. You can buy ram from HP (and boy, will you pay) or you can buy ram from a name brand manufacturer such as <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">Crucial</a>. You’ll still pay more than the cheapest option when it comes to HP RAM upgrades, which is to buy generic RAM, but with the name brand ram you will get the perceived value of buying ram from a reputable name brand memory manufacturer.</p>

<p>My favorite way to save money on HP memory upgrades is to buy generic ram from a trusted third party you can trust. I’ve got a quick list of memory stores in the sidebar that will be happy to not only sell you ram for HP for up to half price, but also offer top notch support if the rare chance you have a problem with your HP RAM.</p>

<p>Generic Memory Upgrades for HP or any other PC manufacturer are my favorite way to save money due to the fact that this ram type is not only half the price you’d pay for name brand memory but the memory is still manufactured to the same exact standards required by HP but without the cost associated with the more expensive and popular name brand memory.</p>

<p>Lastly, if the list of memory stores I list on this page is not enough, you can always <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/where-to-buy-computer-memory-upgrades/">buy HP RAM</a> from a much bigger list of only memory stores that will gladly help get you the best price on your next <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">HP Memory Upgrade</a>.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2011/01/best-place-to-buy-apple-memory/">Best Place to Buy Apple Memory</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>Over the past dozen or so years I have been tracking <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com">Apple memory prices</a>, I have found I’m reluctant to recommend one specific memory store as I have no place to suggest the <strong>best value when it comes to ram upgrades</strong> as value is a subjective thing and for you, the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">best place to buy Apple Memory</a> might be Best Buy or some other electronics retailer in the USA as it’s local and convenient.MacBook Pro RAM is one of the most popular Apple Memory you can buy today:</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW">Best Selling Apple Memory</a></strong></p>

<p>If you’re <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/Apple">buying a a new Apple computer</a>, then the best bet might be just to order your Apple Mac full of ram direct from the factory. This is in most cases, the most expensive memory you can buy but you gain in convenience and can use Apple’s one click ordering system to buy the Mac and RAM at the same time. You don’t need to worry about memory installation instructions or anti-static wrist bands and and the trouble of buying a Mac and then having to worry about where you are going to buy RAM from.</p>

<p>But for most, “best place” translates to “cheapest place” when it comes to RAM as there’s a good chance you are looking for a deal on RAM as opposed to paying full price. But you still need to consider the chance of bad ram, as it is super-rare but does happen and if it happens to you you know you want to buy Apple Memory or memory for any PC from a memory store that offers support if you do run into a problem with your apple RAM upgrade.</p>

<p>So I’ll leave it to you to decide where or whom exactly to buy ram from, but I can make a few suggestions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Compare Apple RAM prices. If price is the dominant factor when it comes to memory upgrades, then I have done the legwork for you and list current apple memory prices for all Apple computers where you can easily find the price you want for RAM.&lt;/p&gt;</li>
  <li>
    <p>If you’re just looking for ram stores to buy from, check out my list of <strong>best memory stores</strong> in the sidebar of this article. Every one of these memory sellers have been in business for over ten plus years and have helped thousands get the right ram for your Mac every time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>If number 2 isn’t enough choice I offer a much <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/where-to-buy-computer-memory-upgrades/">bigger list of memory stores to buy Apple RAM</a></strong></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Apple Memory is cheap</strong>, and you really can’t go wrong with any of the memory stores I have recommended above. If you need further help with your memory upgrades for Apple or any computer, feel free to contact me. I’m happy to help.</p>

I can rhyme of technical specs of Apple Memory without the blink of an eye but when it comes to windows PCs, I find the selection and configurations that the PC manufacturers offer to be almost overwhelming. Besides, I’m an Apple Fan from way back. But RAM is RAM and the same benefit you get from **upgrading your Apple computer **to the most memory possible also applies to PC notebooks too: If you <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memoryx">add more memory to your laptop </a>it will run smoother and faster and with more applications avialable than before.</p>

<p>I can also <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/where-to-buy-computer-memory-upgrades/">recommend just a few memory stores</a> where you can <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">buy ram</a> for MacBook Pro and get a great deal on MBP RAM.  You will get a much better deal buying ram from any one of the memory stores I list and track prices for  than if you were to upgrade the memory from <a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple</a>. Apple RAM is just fine, but you will pay for the pleasure  of buying ram for your MacBook Pro directly from Apple. It’s quite possible to pay close to twice as much than if you were to buy ram from a respectable and trusted third party memory store.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26x%3D0%26ref_%3Dnb_sb_noss%26y%3D0%26field-keywords%3Dmacbook%2520pro%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">latest MacBook Pro 13 inch models</a> accept up to 8GB of RAM and I suggest  you complete this upgrade as the 8GB RAM for MacBook Pros have dropped in price considerably –  I see now for the first time you can buy MacBook Pro RAM  for under $100 from some memory upgrade stores. Not too long ago the same memory would cost you close to $1000 for 8GB of MacBook Pro RAM.</p>

<p>This advice applies to  all Apple MacBook Pro models currently shipping, not just the 13 inch model as though the case and screen size might be smaller on the 13inch MacBook Pro, the memory  requirements are exactly the same for the 15 inch and 17 inch MacBook Pro’s too.</p>

<p>What you want to consider when buying the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">best MacBook Pro RAM</a> is price, sure   – but also warranty in the rare occassion you do get stuck with a bad ram chip you want the piece of mind that comes with a lifetime warranty when shopping for memory upgrades for any Mac, not just the laptop Mac computers.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2011/01/upgrading-mac-ram-2gb-to-4gb/">Upgrading Mac RAM: 2GB to 4GB</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p> </p>

<p>If there’s a sweet spot when it comes to memory upgrades, it is upgrading your memory from 2GB to 4Gb when it comes to <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="mac memory upgrades">Mac Memory Upgrades</a>.MacBook Models from Apple are just one of many notebook computers to take advantage of a 4GB Memory Upgrade from 2GB.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001KUL012/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001KUL012">Best 4GB RAM Memory</a></strong></p>

<p>At 2gb of RAM, what once was considered a very capable amount of memory, in 2011 this amount of memory is at very least standard with your Mac or should  be. When running a current operating system such as I am here as I write this article in wordpress, and with just a few other applications open such as Mail, iTunes, Safari and iPhoto, I am currently using 3GB of the 4GB of RAM (and in my case, this is the maximum RAM for my MacBook Pro. Only 25% of the memory I have installed is free when running Mac OS X, version 10.6.6 and a few Apple Applications running and with open windows.</p>

<p>So, as you can see 2gB of RAM is nice, but 4GB of RAM is better. For some,8GB of memory and higher will be out of reach due to either limitations of the Mac’s maximum memory allowed or even just their pocketbook – 8GB of memory and higher could be too much ram.</p>

<p>But with 4GB of RAM installed you have at very minimum enough RAM to run a current Mac operating system and still have enough memory to have a few Apple applications running and a few windows open. If you don’t have enough RAM and the  2GB you have installed is not  enough ram to run the computing tasks you need, the OS uses the hard disk for temporary memory storage. This is becoming less of an issue thanks due to the popularity of SSD hard drives and as these newer flash based hard drives gain in popularity they will also drop in price too.</p>

<p>But there’s no such thing as having too much RAM and for most computing tasks that are common in everyday use, 4gb of RAM is a good balance of enough ram for those on a budget when considering RAM upgrades.</p>

<p>Below you will find the latest and current ram prices for 4gb RAM for all currently shipping Apple Computer models:</p>

<p>But regardless of whether you currently own a MBP, or are in the market to buy your first MacBook Pro, you should considering adding or upgrading the RAM or Memory on your professional MacBook as adding memory is the best bang for your dollar when wanting to speed up your Mac for less.</p>

<p>The first step in adding RAM is to determine how much RAM you currently have installed in your Apple Computer and it’s pretty easy to determine this with just a few mouse clicks:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Go to the Apple Menu on the top left corner of your screen</li>
  <li>Choose About This Mac</li>
  <li>You will be presented with a window that looks something like this:<br />
<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Screen-shot-2011-01-11-at-2.48.17-PM.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-718 alignnone" title="MacBook Pro RAM installed" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Screen-shot-2011-01-11-at-2.48.17-PM.png" alt="How much RAM installed in MacBook Pro" width="303" height="376" /></a></li>
</ol>

<p>In the case of the image above this information pertains to my 2008 MacBook Pro, and displays the processor speed and also how much RAM is installed. For this particular model, I’m already maxed out with RAM at 4GB, but if you are wanting to upgrade a currently shipping MacBook Pro, you should add more RAM as these models can accept and run 8GB of RAM for MacBook Pros.</p>

<p>16GB is not yet available at time of this article but it’s my guess that the next refresh or even replacement of the MacBook Pro will lead to a maximum allowance of 16GB memory. There was a time not too long ago that my 4GB of RAM installed was a costly and capable amount of memory for Apple’s professional notebook computer.</p>

<p>Once you have determined how much RAM is already installed, all you need to do is <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">buy RAM</a> from an trusted memory store to upgrade your MacBook Pro to its maximum performance potential.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2011/01/best-ram-for-a-mac-ddr-sdram/">Best RAM for a Mac: 8GB 1600 Mhz DDR3 SDRAM</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>When shopping for the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="best mac ram upgrades">best Mac RAM upgrades</a>, regardless of what specific Mac computer you have there’s a very good chance you will be shopping for DDR SDRAM, as this specific memory upgrade type has been in circulation for close to a decade, if not longer.</p>

<div id="asa-df73f90be755f6bb27ee4eb8d88ffce7" class="asa_async_container asa_async_container_default">
</div>

<p>Today’s popular <strong>DDR SDRAM Memory Upgrades</strong> for Mac all tend to be  from the DDR3 family running at speeds of up to 1333Mhz and with capacities of 8GB in size for each DDR3 memory upgrade chip which for upgrading an Apple Mac computer in 2011 means you could, if you have very deep pockets – install up to 64GB of RAM in an Apple Mac Pro.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Even though the DDR3 1333Mhz specification did not start to come onto the scene for Apple Memory Upgrades until the release of the 2010 iMac and Mac Pro models about halfway through the year, in the short time that they have been available, and especially when it comes to the larger Mac Pro Memory Upgrade Kits consisting of memory kits based on 8GB DDR3 1333Mhz memory modules, the prices have dropped at very least 30% in the past six months or so on DDR3 1333Mhz memory upgrades. Regardless of the DDR ram specification,  ram prices continue to drop over time. If you wait, you get a better deal on ram than if you are an early adopter and buy ram when the new DDR3 ram is used and recognized by Apple computers.</p>

<p>The other specification for Apple DDR3 SDRAM is the 1066Mhz speed, which obviously does not run as fast as the 1333Mhz RAM. With other speeds of DDR RAM, you might be able to get away with buying the faster of the two memory upgrade speeds and the ram would gear down to the lower DDR MHz speed if need be. But this is not the case with the DDR3 1066 and DDR3 1333MHz. You cannot interchange the memory for your Mac. If your Apple requires the faster DDR3 RAM, you need to buy the right DDR SDRAM for your Apple Computer Model.</p>

<p>To make things a bit easier for you to determine what RAM you need, here are the current ram prices for currently shipping Apple computer models:</p>

<p>I recently switched from over a decade of using a Mac every day to using a PC notebook. Why? I find that most of my use for my notebook is email and writing and all of this can be done in any browser window. I prefer Chrome from Google as when I compare my open windows from Mac to PC there’s not much difference between a<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005CWJ3MM/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B005CWJ3MM"> $2000 MacBook  Pro</a> and a<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005UUSHD2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B005UUSHD"> $500 PC notebook. </a></p>

<p><strong>Security Programs for PC NoteBooks vs Mac Laptops </strong></p>

<p>One area where I really was unprepared was when it comes to security software. This is one area where the Mac just shines and that’s with viruses –  or the  lack thereof I have experienced on an Apple notebook in all the years I have been using Apple computers.  Compare to a PC, where you need to buy an antivirus program from the moment you turn on your PC and this left me asking what is the best Antivirus software in 2012?</p>

<p><strong>Free Antivirus Software from Microsoft. </strong></p>

<p>One solution for Windows 7 Antivirus software is to download the free **<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/products/security-essentials">Microsoft Security Essentials</a>. **I know there are other antivirus and security options out there. Some free, like <a href="http://free.avg.com/us-en/homepage">AVG</a> and some that will cost you a few dollars from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/mn/search/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;field-keywords=kaspersky&amp;url=search-alias%3Dsoftware&amp;sprefix=kapers#/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias=software">McAfee</a>, <a href="&quot;http://www.amazon.com/mn/search/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;field-keywords=kaspersky&amp;url=search-alias%3Dsoftware&amp;sprefix=kapers">Kaperksy </a>and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/mn/search/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;field-keywords=kaspersky&amp;url=search-alias%3Dsoftware&amp;sprefix=kapers#/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias=software">Norton </a>to name a few, but I figure who would know more about protecting their products more? The folks that made the software you want to protect or  some third party antivirus software company?</p>

<p>In my books it makes perfect sense to trust Microsoft for my Antivirus needs.  I guess it all depends on what you need form  an Antivirus program and from my research that some software excels where others fail, but Microsoft Security essentials meets my needs for one reason: It’s free antivirus software.  I swear, the the older I get  – the cheaper  I get and the thought of  having to pay over $100 for some software to protect my PC that’s not worth much more than that in total hardware costs just does not make sense to me.</p>

<p><strong>Free Antivirus Software That Works</strong></p>

<p>But just because this free software to protect your PC does not  mean it’s no good. Take a look at the feature set for the 2012 version of Microsoft Security Essentials:</p>

<p>Real Time Protection of your PC from spyware, viruses and other malware (malicious software – that’s a fancy term for software that  is up to no good)</p>

<p>System Cleaning automatically quarantines any questionable files on your PC it finds and notifies you of the potential threat.</p>

<p>System Scanning does just what it says it does and scans your system for any viruses you may already have on your Windows PC but not know  it.</p>

<p>Automatic Firewall Protection. The firewall settings can be tricky  to navigate for  the average PC user like me  and  the MSE takes care of all that  technical stuff for me.</p>

<p>Rootkit protection sounds complicated, and this is just one more thing that  the free antivirus software from Microsoft takes care of for me and it’s sophisticated enough  to recognize the good software from the bad that could  harm your PC.</p>

<p>And this is the part that I was really impressed with – Microsoft Essentials takes care of the network protection as  I am totally lost when it comes to protecting other computers on my home network. I am  happy to hand this task off to Microsoft.</p>

<p><strong>Why is  this antivirus software for Windows 7 Free? </strong></p>

<p>Microsoft could have charged for this – and charged  a pretty competitive price too. Others that offer free antivirus usually are really fremium where the whole point is to nag you to death until you cave and buy their full featured software and thus, the income stream.  I think Microsoft offers this antivirus software for free is for goodwill.</p>

<p>Think about it : If this free software keeps your Windows 7 PC running smoothly and trouble free you are more likely to think that Windows is overall is a better value, and  over time you will continue to buy more Windows PCs allowing  Microsoft to sell more software. You may win short term,  but in  the end Microsoft gets to keep you as a loyal customer which is something they value more than any $20 profit on anivirus software.</p>

<p>Have a look at <strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/products/security-essentials">Microsoft Security Essentials</a></strong>. MSE download is free,  so this all costs you nothing but the time to install Microsoft Essentials download. This is one of the best software available today for keeping your PC virus free for free.  It’s working fine for me.</p>

<p>Determining what <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">DDR3 RAM</a> you need for your Apple Macintosh computer is really not all that difficult as Apple lists technical specifications for all <a href="http://www.apple.com/mac/">current shipping Macs</a> on their website which will help you find the correct DDR3 memory for new Apple Computers such as Apple iMac, Apple MacBook Pro, Apple MacBook and Mac Pro and Mac Mini computer models.</p>

<p>If you’re looking to upgrade a now discontinued apple computer there’s a good chance that DDR3 memory is not the correct memory you need anyway, as except for a few recently discontinued Apple computers like the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/iMac_(DDR3_1066)/">discontinued Apple iMac</a> that until mid summer 2010 was a current Apple iMac model most older computers from Apple require either DDR1 or even just DDR memory to run. If you do need to upgrade RAM on non-DDR3 Apple computers I suggest you visit <a href="http://www.lowendmac.com">Low End Mac</a> which has specifications on memory and more for every mac ever made.</p>

<p>Now that we’ve determined that you do need to <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com">buy DDR3 RAM for Mac</a> the next question to get asked is where to buy Apple Memory and from whom? I’ve put together a little list of <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/where-to-buy-computer-memory-upgrades/">Apple Memory Stores</a> where you can use to find a third party memory store that suits your needs when shopping for DDR3 RAM.</p>

<p>Usually, the next step after you have determined which DDR3 RAM you need and where you might like to buy DDR3 RAM from is price. It’s only natural to want to save money on memory upgrades, regardless of memory type and again, I have compiled some data on DDR3 RAM prices for Apple Computers:</p>

<p>Desktop memory, while not as popular a computer memory upgrade as it once might have been due to the popularity of notebooks, netbooks and even tablet computers such as the Apple iPad still can offer the most bang per computing dollar thanks to the design which in most cases, allow for faster processors, better cooling and larger displays than their portable counterparts.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013FK9U2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0013FK9U2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1052" title="Cheapest Mac Mini" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-14-at-10.51.55-AM.png" alt="Best Deal Mac Mini" width="283" height="168" /></a></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013FK9U2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0013FK9U2">Best Selling Desktop</a>: The Apple Mac Mini</strong></p>

<p>One of the <strong>best upgrades for a desktop computer (</strong>save perhaps for a processor) is to add more memory and fill your desktop computer with as much memory as possible – regardless of whether you built your own PC or are looking for more performance out of your factory desktop from computer manufacturers such as <a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple</a>, <a href="http://www.dell.com">Dell</a>, or <a href="http://www.hp.com">HP</a>.</p>

<p>One of the first things you need to do when shopping for the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="best desktop ram upgrades"><strong>best desktop ram upgrades</strong></a> is to determine what specific memory you need. If on a PC, many if not all memory stores and manufacturers offer a simple to use memory configurator that allows you to enter your processor or desktop computer model number or name into a form and the correct memory specifications will be returned to you.</p>

<p>Another option for determining the best ram for your desktop is to download a simple application that scans your computer for information relating to your model name, processor speed and in most cases this application will return specific part numbers for your desktop PC when it comes to memory upgrade requirements. <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">Crucial Technology</a> is just one memory store that offers this easy to download memory upgrade configurator.</p>

<p>Once you have determined the <strong>memory upgrade you need</strong>, the next step is to find the best price on desktop ram and I can recommend more than a few <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/where-to-buy-computer-memory-upgrades/" title="best memory stores">memory stores</a> that offer competitive pricing on desktop memory where you can save significantly when it comes time to upgrade your desktop PC.</p>

<p>If theres’s one theme to ramseeker.com it’s the fact that with a few minutes of research on ram prices it’s quite possible to save up to 40% off when buying RAM when you compare the ram prices between third party memory stores like <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memoryx">MemoryX</a>, <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/1800">18004Memory</a>, <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/OWC">OWC</a> and recently, <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">Crucial Technology</a> all offer much better and competitive pricing on memory upgrades than if you were to buy ram direct from the computer manufacturer such as <a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple</a>,  <a href="http://www.dell.com">Dell</a>, <a href="http://hp.com">HP</a> and so on…</p>

<p>The only reason I can think of why you might want to buy ram direct from the manufacturer of your computer is if  you were to configure the memory upgrade at the same time you bought your computer. You’ll pay for the convenience of doing so, but the benefit of doing this is you eliminate the cost and hassle of having to <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com">buy memory online</a> and then installing the memory upgrade in your computer yourself. The downside of ordering or shopping for memory at the same time as buying your computer is the cost. You will pay more for memory. What you may gain in time and convenience, you will lose from your pocketbook.</p>

<p>If you’re like me and you want to buy quality memory upgrades at a better price that are still manufactured to the same exacting standards that the manufacturers demand for the memory upgrades that are compatible with  their specific computer models but without the high cost of memory that’s in most instances associated with buying ram direct from the manufacturer.</p>

<p>The solution to saving money when buying ram online is to buy ram from a trusted third party memory store. A memory store that except for a few rare cases, manufactures the memory they sell and offer the support and guarantee of the manufacturer branded memory upgrade, but without the high cost associated with the factory ram. When you compare ram prices and shop around for memory upgrades online you can <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="save up to 40% off ram">save up to 40% off ram upgrades</a> and buy memory that’s easy to install yourself but for much lesss money</p>

</a>The Apple MacBook Pro is one of the most popular Apple computers currently on sale today thanks to the professional speed and performance today’s computer user demands but on thing that’s sorely missing on a new Apple notebook that costs over a thousand dollars at the very minimum is the fact that the MacBook Pro’s do not come direct from Apple with the maximum possible memory installed. (unless you configure your MacBook Pro from the Apple Store with the maximum ram already installed)</p>

<p>[table id=14 /]</p>

<p>To increase the performance of your MacBook Pro you need to, or I suggest that you do – add more ram. The newest MacBook Pro’s from Apple allow you to install 8GB of memory in them, and this is regardless of MacBook Pro screen size. 13, 15 and 17 inch MacBook Pro’s all max out at 8GB (my guess is the  2011 MacBook Pros will max out at 16GB, but at the time of writing, this is just a guess)</p>

<p>So the question that is asked is: <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="cheapest ram for macbook pro">What is the Cheapest RAM for MacBook Pro</a></strong>?</p>

<p>This depends on a few variables before I can help answer this question as it depends on whether you are looking to buy name brand memory or generic ram for the MacBook Pros.  With the name brand RAM, such as Crucial Technology (other stores carry name brand memory too, but it’s my policy to list their cheaper generic ram)  you get the satisfaction of a better (perceived, anyway) brand than if you were to buy generic memory.</p>

<p>But don’t discount the generic RAM for MacBook Pro as this memory, in my opinion is not only the cheaper memory option, but I have found works just as well as the name brand stuff, but for much less money, close to 50% off in some instances. The generic memory is still manufactured to the same standards as name brand memory but just doesn’t come with the name brand sticker. You’re still buying ram from a memory store you can trust that offers a lifetime guarantee and have been in business for at very least a decade and specialize in both Apple memory but also PC memory too.</p>

<p>Save some money,  compare prices on MacBook Pro Memory and max out your Apple MacBook Prow with as much ram as it can handle.</p>

<p>Here’s some current <strong>cheapest prices on Apple MacBook Memory Upgrades</strong>:</p>

<p>Lenovo is of many PC notebook and netbooks that could benefit from a memory upgrade in 2011 as in most cases, when these IBM notebook computers ship they ship with too little memory as default. This is done sometimes to keep the costs of the notebook computer down as the notebook PC market can be competitive and another reason why lenovo notebook PC’s don’t ship with maxed out memory is that in some cases for casual PC users who might just surf the internet, check email and <a href="http://www.facebook.com">facebook</a> the factory installed ram is enough.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0040X4LZI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0040X4LZI"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1214" title="Best Selling Lenovo Notebook" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-7.17.30-AM.png" alt="Best Selling Lenovo Notebook" width="311" height="281" /></a></p>

<p>But for the rest of us, and especially if  you use your notebook Lenovo computer to earn a living or for business you will want to upgrade the RAM on your notebook PC to get better performance than what the default factory ram installation can provide. Adding more memory allows for a faster Lenovo PC computer that can better accommodate the Windows operating system that runs on the Lenovo notebook PC’s and with fewer crashes and the ability to run more applications at the same time with the RAM maxed out on this PC notebook.</p>

<p><strong>Where Can I <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="buy cheap memory">Buy Cheap Memory</a> for Lenovo?</strong></p>

<p>Now that you’ve realized the benefits of a laptop memory upgrade it’s now time to do a little bit of shopping online for memory. You work hard for your dollar, and you don’t want to over spend on your memory upgrade but do have to decide where you want your money to go when it comes to ram upgrades. You can choose name brand memory or generic RAM. The name brand RAM pretty much explains itself. You’re buying quality RAM from an established brand with a big name in the RAM biz. <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">Crucial Technology </a>comes to mind.</p>

<p>But if you want to get cheap ram for Lenovo, don’t discount generic memory which can save you up to 40% off and still get a memory upgrade that’s guaranteed to work when you install the memory into your notebook. I’ve made a list of** <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="http://www.ramseeker.com/where-to-buy-computer-memory-upgrades/">**recommended memory stores**</a> that will sell you **Lenovo RAM for less</strong> and yet still offer you the guarantee and support you expect when spending money on memory. Most, if not all the stores also offer the choice to buy both generic and name brand memory from the same source so you have a choice. Except in rare circumstances, I suggest saving  money on ram and buying generic memory for your Lenovo notebook.</p>

<p>For the <strong>2010 MacBook Pro models</strong>, you will need to **<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_Pro_(1066_DDR3)/">buy 4GB x2 memory upgrades</a> **and replace the factory ram from Apple (usually 2GB x 2)  with the larger <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_Pro_(1066_DDR3)-4gb/" title="4GB apple macbook pro ram">4GB Apple MacBook Pro RAM</a>.  Some memory stores will <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/where-can-i-sell-old-ram/" title="buy back old ram">buy back your old RAM</a>, or you can sell the smaller memory modules online at such places like eBay or craigslist to help offset the cost of upgrading your 2010 MacBook Pro for maximum performance with the most ram allowable and recognizeable by your professional Apple Computer.</p>

<p>MacBook Pro memory upgrades come in two flavors: generic and name brand. Both options are just fine, and the best ram for MacBook Pro is the memory you feel most comofortbale with. Name brand ram might offer value to you if you would prefer not to install generic ram, but the generic memory I track prices for will work just fine and you get the added benefit of saving money on memory upgrades – up to 50% off the name brand vendor but you still can trust the generic memory store as all memory stores I track prices for are reputable memory stores that have been with me for at very least a decade and offer money back gaurantees and warranties for your MacBook Pro RAM upgrade in the slight chance that there’s something wrong with your MacBook RAM, but it’s unlikely. In 14 years of monitoring ram prices, I can count the complaints about the memory stores I track on one hand and yet over the years I have helped thousands save money on memory upgrades.</p>

<p>Specializing in Apple computers, I help you get the best deal on ram upgrades from a selection of online memory stores that offer low prices and most important – support – both pre-sale and post-sale for your memory or hard drive buy, as  both of these are the two best upgrades you can do for your computer, regardless of make. (notebook batteries might also be considered a worthy upgrade as witthout power even the best computer with the most RAM and biggest hard drive is useless).</p>

<p>Now that we have that out of the way, I need to clarify a bit. First, for the most part I specialize in <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="apple memory upgrades">Apple Computer Memory Upgrades</a> for the most part, so if you’re in the market for the cheapest Dell memory, or  HP memory or where to buy cheap memory in Canada let’s say I may or may not be the resource you want.

<p>If you’re in the market for the cheapest ram to buy I think it’s my duty to advise you that the cheapest ram might not be the deal you think it is. In fact, it’s probably in your best interest to buy RAM from an established memory store or even  better if you’re a Mac user is a <a href="http://www.macsales.com" title="mac memory specialist">store that specializes in Mac Memory</a>. You may not buy the cheapest RAM this way but you will get hassle free RAM with lifetime support from memory sellers that actually know what RAM you need to buy – regardless of Mac or PC.</p>

<p>RAM  is so cheap these days,  as long as you buy it from an established computer memory manufacturer, it seems almost silly to worry about whether you saved a few percent over some other store as the price difference from most trusted stores usually only differs about the same as the cost of a cup of coffee.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/" title="buy ram">Buy RAM</a> from a fair  and trusted memory store and you will have no problems with your memory upgrade which is worth more than any savings on RAM you might find from lesser memory resellers. Worry about support and quality –  not the cheapest price.</p>

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW">MacBook Pro DDR3 8GB Memory Kits</a></strong></p>

<p>The memory type the Apple MacBook Pro’s use depends on how new (or old)  your Apple MacBook Pro is. If you have a brand new Apple MacBook Pro the answer is easy, as  these new MacBook Pro models for 2010 use DDR3 1066Mhz SDRAM so-dimms that are on sale from a wide selection of <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="trusted memory shops">trusted memory shops</a>.<br />
[table id=1 /]</p>

<p>It’s purely speculation on my part, but as we hit the 2011 calendar year, I think we will see a new MacBook Pro release soon that will use the faster DDR3 1333MHz memory specification, as both the Apple iMac and Mac Pro already run at this speed so it’s just a matter of  time until the new MacBook Pro’s use faster ram as well.</p>

<p>But I’m not an <a href="http://www.applerumors.com" title="apple rumor site">Apple Rumor </a>website, and for now the current MacBook Pros can run DDR3 1066Mhz SDRAM sodimm and can accept up to 8GB of RAM. 16GB of RAM is not yet supported in any MacBook Pro currently shipping but that too will change soon enough I’m guessing.</p>

<p><strong>MacBook Pro DDR3 1066MHz Memory Prices</strong></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;">Now that we have determined what kind of DDR3 RAM the MacBook Pro uses, the next step is to determine where to <a title="buy macbook pro ram" href="http://www.ramseeker.com">buy MacBook Pro RAM</a> and I can help you with that as I have been tracking and monitoring RAM prices for not just the current MacBook Pro models  but older models too: </span></p>

<p>[table id=1 /]</p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;"><br /> </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;">MacBook Pro memory is so cheap that when you compare the cost of maxing out your MacBook Pro with RAM compared to what you paid for the computer in the first place, it just seems like a no brainer to me to upgrade the RAM  as much as you can on Apple’s professional notebook computer model. </span></p>

<p>Why? Buying memory from pretty much any memory store will be cheaper than if  you bought RAM from Apple directly. To their credit, <a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple</a> does offer you the ability to buy the computer and then fill Mac with RAM at time of purchase online. This means you don’t have to replace RAM, as you would have to do if you were to buy your Apple Computer separately and then upgrade, as most of us do.</p>

<p>The downside of buying your  Apple computer, and then buying RAM from a much more affordable source is that you are left with the original RAM to deal with. You can <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/where-can-i-sell-old-ram/" title="sell original memory">sell your memory</a> which will offset the cost of your RAM purchase, but there’s more effort and steps involved if you decide not to buy RAM from the Apple Store.</p>

<p>If you’re buying  a new Mac from Apple, and the extra cost is no big deal to you, than just order your new Mac with the RAM you want and be done and happy with your new Apple Computer.</p>

<p>If you are already in possession of your Apple Computer and want to upgrade the RAM, and want to save money on RAM then the smart thing to do is upgrade the memory yourself and deal with the factory memory that you pull from your mac. You can sell the ram on eBay, make a keychain, give it away  – the choice is yours, but if you’ve already got a Mac to upgrade, then no, do not buy RAM from the Apple Store.</p>

<p>If there’s one popular computer when it comes to <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com">RAM Prices</a> (or if you prefer, memory prices) it’s the MacBook Pro.  Desktop computers do have their applications and usually offer more value in speed, upgradeability and  in some cases as the Apple iMac – screen size – it’s the notebook computers from Apple that really offer the best value whether you choose the budget oriented MacBook or the faster MacBook Pro that offers more expandability options as well.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1149" title="Cheapest MacBook Pro" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-24-at-7.39.14-AM1.png" alt="Best MacBook Pro Price" width="283" height="223" /></a></p>

<p>One of the best expandability options on the MacBook Pro is the option to add more RAM memory (RAM and Memory should be considered interchangeable when it comes to this article).</p>

<p>The newest Apple MacBook models (which aren’t that new – there’s a a MacBook Pro refresh needed in 2011)  allow for a maximum of 8GB DDR3 SDRAM sodimms to be installed replacing what is usually installed from the factory: 2x2GB memory modules for  a total of 4GB MacBook Pro RAM that ships standard with your MacBook Pro.</p>

<p>But to get the maximum performance from your professional Apple notebook computer, I recommend you max out your MBP to the 8GB allowable. 8GB for the MacBook Pro costs just over $100 at time of writing – a far cry from the $1000 it cost just a few short years ago, making a 8GB RAM Upgrade for MacBook Pro one of the better upgrades you can achieve this year to increase your computing performance.</p>

<p><strong>Where to Buy MacBook Pro Memory</strong></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;">I have been tracking RAM Prices on MacBook Pro memory starting with the DDR2 memory the older MacBook Pro’s  required and now with the newer and faster MacBook Pros that use the DDR3 RAM instead and I prefer to leave it to you to decide where to buy MacBook Pro RAM rather than push one particular store.  The lowest price on MacBook Pro Memory is just one factor when considering buying RAM for Apple but below is a table listing current and lowest ram prices for MacBook Pro: </span></p>

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p> </p>

<p>The short answer:  not much at all. <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="ram is cheap">RAM is cheap</a> and you should, if you can afford to – max out the RAM on your Apple Computer.<br />
[table id=15 /]MacBook Pro Memory is just one of the most popular Apple upgrades you can buy today.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW">Best RAM for Apple Notebooks</a></strong></p>

<p>The longer answer to this question is: it depends on what computer you want to add more memory to, be it an Apple iMac, Apple MacBook, Apple MacBook Pro or Apple Mac Pro as they all require different memory upgrades depending on what specific Apple Computer you are looking to upgrade.</p>

<p>For this article, we’re going to talk about currently shipping <a href="ttp://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref_%3Dnb_sb_ss_c_1_14%26field-keywords%3Dapple%2520computer%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Delectronics%26sprefix%3Dapple%2520computer&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">Apple Computers on sale</a> and we’ll cover the discontinued Apple computers in the future.</p>

<p>For the Apple iMac it will <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/iMac_(DDR3_1333)/">cost you as little as $52 for a 4GB memory upgrade</a> module. Assuming the Apple iMac can accept 16GB , you will need to buy four 4gb memory modules for iMac which would bring your total up to just over $200 at today’s memory prices for Apple iMac</p>

<p>With the professional desktop from Apple – the Apple Mac Pro, this is where it gets really interesting as depending on which current Apple Mac Pro you have you might require DDR3 1066Mhz or DDR3 1333MHz sodimm memory upgrades. And as there’s  lots of room for memory upgrades inside a Mac Pro you could <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/Mac_Pro_RAM_Upgrade_Kits_DDR3_1333_with_8GB_RAM/">drop almost $2000 to fill your Mac Pro with memory</a> up to the Maximum 64GB of RAM the latest Mac Pro models can recognize</p>

<p>The tiny desktop Mac, the Mac Mini use DDR3 1066Mhz sodimms and can accept up to 8GB of DDR3 SDRAM so to max out your new Apple Mac Mini you would need to <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/Mac_Mini_(1066_DDR3)/" title="buy 4gb ram mac mini">buy 4GB x 2</a> to get the full performance from Apple’s tiniest desktop computer made to date costing you a bit over $100 with two 4GB Mac Mini RAM upgrades</p>

<p>On the notebook side, Both the Apple MacBook and Apple MacBook Pro accept the same type of RAM: The DDR3 SDRAM 1066Mhz sodimms, the difference between the two models being the maximum amounts of memory the two different MacBook models can accept. On the MacBook, 4GB of RAM is the maximum so the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_KITS_(1066_DDR3)-4gb/" title="macbook ram prices">cost would be as little as $50</a> and for the MacBook Pro’s which can accept up to 8GB of RAM, the cost doubles to just a tad <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_KITS_(1066_DDR3)/">over $100 to fill your MacBook Pro with the most memory possible</a>.</p>

<p>[table id=2 /]DDR3 RAM for iMac has been the default memory type for the popular Apple desktop computer for some time now. Until earlier this summer the Apple iMacs used and required only one type of DDR3 RAM : DDR3 1066MHz SDRAM so-dimms.</p>

<p>But with the release of the newest Apple iMacs in the summer of 2010, Apple introduced a new memory requirement that not only used faster ram speed than prior iMacs but also allowed the iMac to use and recognize up to 16GB of RAM.</p>

<p>DDR3 1333MHz memory upgrades are what is required for the newest Apple iMacs when it comes to memory upgrades for Apple’s latest computer.</p>

<p>Buying DDR3 memory from Apple, in my opinion is not a good way to save your hard earned money and you can do better on the price if you buy either generic or even name brand memory for the Apple iMacs from a <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com">trusted third party memory store</a>.</p>

<p>DDR3 memory price for Apple iMac continue to drop in price over time, and just about two years ago, upgrading your Apple iMac to 8GB would  cost you as much as the desktop itself. But as the DDR3 RAM technology becomes more popular the prices for DDR3 RAM just get cheaper and cheaper.</p>

<p><strong>DDR3 RAM Prices for iMac</strong></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;">I monitor both DDR3 1066MHz and DDR3 1333Mhz memory upgrades in both memory upgrade kit form as some memory stores prefer to market the RAM for iMacs in this fashion as there’s a good chance you will buy 2 or more iMac memory modules to install at the same time to maximize your iMac’s memory. But I also list DDR3 iMac RAM prices for individual memory uprades for  iMac as well. I suggest you check both to get the best deal on your DDR3 RAM upgrade purchase.</span></p>

<p>It’s been a few years since the Black MacBook models were available so it should come as no surprise that these MacBook models take and accept  less RAM than the more modern unibody MacBook models available today.</p>

<p>As far as <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com">Maximum RAM for the Black MacBooks</a>, the answer to this question will depend on the source. According to Apple the Black MacBooks can accept and use up to 4Gb on the later 2008 models, but some memory vendors claim to be able to run 6GB of black macbook memory without trouble, but it’s always been my policy to tow the company line and  stick to the maximum memory upgrades as quoted by Apple. Your mileage may vary…</p>

<p>For older MacBook models in black, the maximum memory was a paltry 2GB (when compared to today’s 4GB maximum) of <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_(PC5300_DDR)/">PC2 5300 DD2 SDRAM sodimms</a> that the black macbook requires to run.  Again, some memory stores claimed 3GB would  work in the black macbooks thanks to 2GB installed in one of the two memory upgrade slots available for upgrade but again, Apple says it will take 2GB maximum, so this is the maximum amount I suggest. To do so, you will have to replace the smaller sized factory memory (usually 2x512mb)  and install 1GB x 2 for a maximum of 2GB on the black MacBook models.</p>

<p>When shopping for <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com">MacBook Pro Memory </a> it can be a good idea to shop for memory upgrade kits for MacBook Pro as some memory stores offer memory upgrade kits that include two MacBook Pro memory upgrade modules.</p>

<p>Usually, these memory upgrade kits make sense to buy as you usually save money on MacBook Pro ram as you will need to buy two memory modules anyway if you want to maximize the ram on your MacBook Pro and 8GB kits for MacBook Pro is the most memory you can install in MacBook Pros in 2010 (and 2011 so far, but my guess is this  will change with new MacBook models being announced soon enough).</p>

<p>The good news is 8GB RAM upgrades for MacBook Pro in kit form (4GB x 2) have dropped in price considerably when compared to just over a year ago where you would pay almost as much as the cost of the Apple computer itself just to Max out the RAM.</p>

<p>At time of writing this you can buy 8GB RAM for MacBook Pro for as little as $<del>110</del>, $40.00 which when you amortize the cost over a year – a reasonable time to use the same notebook computer, the cost add the most RAM to your MacBook Pro works out to less than $1.00 per day. For that money spent with your 8GB DDR3 RAM purchase you get a faster, smoother running Apple professional notebook that can mean you get your work done faster than if you had not upgraded your memory.</p>

<p>The prices for 8GB for MacBook Pros change constantly. Below is a table of the cheapest RAM prices for  MacBook Pro that gets updated continually, and includes other memory upgrades as well as just 8GB kits for MacBook Pro</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/Mac_mini/" title="mac mini pc2700 sdram">The first Mac Mini requires PC27000 DDR RAM</a></p>

<p>The second series of Mac Mini uses PC5300 DDR SDRAM and is marketed as both <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/Mac_Mini_KITS_(PC5300)/">Mac Mini memory upgrade kits</a> or by <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/Mac_Mini_(PC_5300)/">individual Mac Mini PC5300 memory modules</a>.</p>

<p>The latest and newest Apple Mac Minis to be released require DDR3 SDRAM and <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/Mac_Mini_(1066_DDR3)/">Mac Mini DDR3 memory</a> and <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/Mac_Mini_KITS_(1066_DDR3)/">Mac Mini DDR3 memory upgrade kits</a> are available to purchase for Apple’s smallest and cheapest Apple computer available today.</p>

<p>Now that we have determined the different Mac Mini models and what memory modules you will need to buy the next question is <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="where to buy mac mini ram">where to buy RAM for Apple Mac Mini</a>? I compare ram prices from reputable memory stores only (and have for over 14 years) so you won’t find any shady memory resllers. What you will find is quality ram for your Mac Mini at competitive prices and all from Memory stores you can trust to deliver quality memory upgrades right to your door which you can <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4432" title="mac mini ram install">install yourself</a> thanks to instructions for Mac Mini memory installation directly from Apple.</p>

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>If you buy any new computer, regardless of make or brand  – be it a Dell, Apple, HP or other computer manufacturer when it comes time to upgrade your notebook or desktop computer you usually have to replace the factory installed memory upgrade with larger sized memory upgrade modules to add more memory to your computer</p>

<div style="float: right; margin-right: 5px;">
</div>

<p>Unless you buy your computer direct from the factory and with the maximum memory installed you will want to, or need to replace your memory that is already in your computer for a larger memory upgrade chip. One way to offset the cost of  a memory upgrade for your computer is to sell the factory ram to a memory reseller or manufacturer where they can still use the parts and individual chips on the memory board for the manufacture of larger memory upgrades in the future.</p>

<p>This leaves you asking:** “where can I sell old RAM”? **and it’s a good question as some, not all memory manufacturers will buy back your memory but I do know of a few placesa that will be happy to buy your RAM that was previously installed in your computer:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Sell the RAM yourself</strong>. This could effectively gain you the highest price possible if you were to decide to sell old ram in this manner. <a href="http://www.ebay.com">Ebay</a> and <a href="http://www.craigslist.org">Craigslist</a> are two such websites where you could get paid cash for your old memory or ram upgrades</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>**Sell the RAM back to the computer memory manufacturer **at the same time as you buy new ram. Essentially working the same way as trade-in on a car purchase works, you trade in your old ram and use the funds from the old ram against your new memory buy.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p> **Sell the RAM back to a memory store or manufacturer that is different **from where you buy your new memory upgrades</p>
  </li>

<p>The Apple MacBook Pro is a fantastic computer, no doubt about it. I have, and use one and have stuck with Apple notebook computers since the PowerBook 165c (which I paid something silly like $5000 for back in the day).</p>

<p>But the Apple MacBook needs one thing to run at the maximum speed this computer is capable of and that’s the fact that adding more memory to your MacBook Pro will increase the performance and offer the best bang for buck than any other upgrade possible you could get for your Apple Notebook. Adding and installing more memory in your Apple MacBook Pro is better than buying USB flash drives, installing software, adding a bigger hard drive in your MacBook Pro (this might be the 2nd best upgrade you could do) or anything else you might think makes your MacBook Pro run faster and well, better.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I"><img title="Best Price MacBook Pro" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-24-at-7.39.14-AM.png" alt="See Best Price on MacBook Pro" width="283" height="223" /></a></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I">Best Price on MacBook Pro</a></strong></p>

<p>One question I get asked is a lot is:** Is all MacBook Memory is the same**?.</p>

<p>The answer is No. What you’re looking for when buying memory for your MacBook Pro is</p>

<ol>
  <li>Price.</li>
  <li>Quality</li>
  <li>Support</li>
</ol>

<p>Chances are you’re here because you want the best price on MacBook Pro RAM you can find, and you’re not alone – I compare MacBook Pro RAM Prices for both individual modules and MacBook Pro memory upgrade kits, so it only makes sense that you want to spend less and get more when you’re ready to <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com">buy MacBook Pro RAM</a>.</p>

<p>But price is only one part of the equation. I’d put quality at the top of the list instead.  Who wants to buy crappy ram? I don’t, and I don’t track memory store prices from memory vendors that do. Quality to me means that RAM for your MacBook Pro is built with high quality parts to the exact specifications that Apple requires for Apple MacBook memory. And that’s what you should be looking for when ram shopping. Not the best ram  price, quality ram priced right.</p>

<p>Lastly, (and I’m a huge fan of this)  is support. Without this, you’re dead in the water. You want to buy memory from  a memory store you can trust that in the rare case you do have MacBook Pro RAM problems you can return the memory knowing that the store you bought the MacBook Pro memory will stand behind the product and help you resolve your issue if the case needs it.</p>

<p>**Where and What MacBook Pro Memory **to Buy is really up to you to decide, but I can <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="recommended memory stores">recommend memory stores</a> that are established and can be trusted to help you when you’re ready to buy MacBook Pro Memory Upgrades</p>

<p>The  Apple iMac is a very popular desktop computer from Apple and one way to better the performance of Apple’s best selling desktop computer is to add more memory and now with the latest iMac models being able to recognize 16GB of RAM the 4GB memory upgrade for Apple iMacs is a very popular memory upgrade here on ramseeker. One of the most popular memory upgrades we sell in fact, only bested by the more popular Apple notebook computers such as the MacBook and MacBook Pros</p>

<p>[table id=2 /]</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8IO6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8IO6">Cheapest Apple iMac</a></strong></p>

<p>4GB RAM for iMac can be bought for many different Apple iMac models and depending on the specific iMac model you are looking to upgrade the price and also the memory type that your particular Apple iMac requires could be different.</p>

<p>Currently shipping iMacs are the most popular Apple computers to upgrade and they require the newer 1333MHz SDRAM memory upgrades. Available as either a <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/iMac_(DDR3_1333)-4gb/">4GB 1333Mhz memory module</a> or as a <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/iMac_KITS_(DDR3_1333)-4gb/">4GB 1333Mhz memory upgrade kit</a> which will be the cheaper of the two choices.</p>

<p>Just discontinued Apple iMacs this summer 2010 used the older DDR3 memory standard running at 1066Mhz which also require and can accept <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/iMac_KITS_(DDR3_1066)/">4GB memory modules for iMac</a> as well as <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/iMac_KITS_(DDR3_1066)-4gb/">4GB memory upgrade kits for iMac</a>.</p>

<p>Older iMacs that require either <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/iMac_(PC2_6400)/">DDR2 PC6400 SDRAM </a> or even <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/iMac_(PC5300)/">PC5300 DDR2 SDRAM</a> may  be able to accept 4GB for Apple iMac, but this will depend on your specific model of iMac, as some older Apple iMacs could only accept 2GB of RAM. <a href="http://www.lowendmac.com">Low End Mac</a> and <a href="http://www.everymac.com">Every Mac</a> are two resources that I always refer to when  checking  the memory upgrade specifications  of now discontinued Apple computers.</p>

<p>4GB RAM is the newest ram available for Apple iMac but is now an affordable upgrade option for those looking to either upgrade a new or even older Apple iMac computer today.</p>

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>I think adding or even maximizing memory on any computer is worth it, regardless of whether it’s a MacBook Pro, Macbook, iMac or any other Apple computer on sale today. All Apple models (and most PC models too) can benefit from a memory upgrade, and especially the MacBook Pro.</p>

<p>[table id=1 /]<br />

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I">Best MacBook Pro Deals</a></strong></p>

<p>With the MacBook, one could argue that for most MacBook users, the 2GB of RAM that these consumer notebooks ship with from the factory is enough ram for most general computing needs such as email, web, facebook and Apple’s applications that ship with the Apple MacBook at no extra charge and they would be right. You can do just fine with 2GB of RAM on an Apple MacBook.</p>

<p>But a MacBook Pro is a different story. This is a professional grade notebook computer from Apple that offers added expansion ports, faster processor, and more memory expansion opportunities than what’s possible with the lesser MacBook model. Why would you not want to run your very expensive apple notebook computer as fast as you possibly can?</p>

<p>Maxing out the Memory on a MacBook Pro is the most cost effective upgrade you can do for this Apple notebook. At time of writing this, <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_Pro_KITS_(1066_DDR3)/">Apple MacBook Pro 8GB RAM</a> sells for as little as $110.00. Assuming you maximize your new and current MacBook Pro to the full 8GB and keep your professional notebook for one year, the macbook ram upgrade works out to a little over $9.00 a month. What other way can you spend so little money to make you work faster? We’re talking 30 cents a day to upgrade your MacBook Pro so it will run faster, open more applications and just run smoother overall.</p>

<p>To summarize – yes, I think <strong>upgrading the MacBook Pro RAM is worth it.</strong> RAM Upgrades are the best bargain in computing available today.</p>

<p>Yes and No.</p>

<p>You can <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/">buy memory online</a></strong> from a wide selection of memory sellers or stores who will be more than happy to sell you memory for cheap prices and offer you a lifetime warranty on the memory upgrade and give you support if you need it, but RAM is a physical product that you insert into your desktop or notebook computer to enhance speed and performance of your computer, regardless of make.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004Q3R9BK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004Q3R9BK">Cheap Flash Memory</a></strong></p>

<p>What you cannot do is add memory online as if RAM or memory were some kind of software or other free download. You can <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">buy memory</a> but it has to be shipped to you just as you would order a book from Amazon or <a href="http://www.americanflower.org">Flowers for Delivery</a> you buy the memory, wait for it to arrive and then follow instructions on how to install memory for your desktop or notebook computer.</p>

<p><strong>Where To Buy Computer Memory</strong><br />
I have created a list of trusted and respected memory stores that I can recommend that will be happy to sell you a memory upgrade, and except for rare instances the memory upgrade you buy from these online memory stores will be much cheaper than if you were to buy memory from the manufacturer of your computer. It’s quite easy and possible to save up to half price on memory without much trouble at all by visiting the memory stores and and noting the lowest price from each memory reseller or manufacturer.</p>

<p>If this sounds like a heck of a lot of work to go to each memory store and check the price for you notebook (desktops seem to be less popular these days) it is, but I have taken the opportunity to do the work for you and offer ram prices compared from a list of respectable memory stores that offer the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com">best ram prices</a> as well as the customer support you would expect and deserve.</p>

<p>RAM Memory is cheap. Especially if you buy RAM or Memory online and have it shipped to you where you can install it yourself with nothing more than some household tools you already have. But you have to buy the memory first.</p>

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p><strong>Cheapest Notebook Memory Prices<br />
**<br />
When shopping for ram, and in my experience in tracking ram prices for close to fifteen years I essentially answer one question each and every day: “</strong>Who has the cheapest memory**?”</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VNKNF0/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B003VNKNF0">Cheapest Memory Upgrades</a></strong></p>

<p>In an internet and smartphone driven world, it’s easy in 2011 to enter a search term and find what you are looking for and when shopping for memory upgrades, the memory store with the lowest price on ram usually gets the sale.</p>

<p>But low price does not mean good price sometimes, which is why I only track and monitor ram prices from memory vendors or memory stores that are actually reputable and stand behind the products they sell by offering a no questions asked warranty and friendly and reliable customer service. It’s long been my stance to just monitor the ram prices from these memory stores and not recommend one specific memory reseller over another. I do have an option to sort by ram price, which allows you to decide where you want to spend your money on ram upgrades and I do have a section on lowest ram prices where you can see the cheapest ram prices from all memory stores.</p>

<p>But it’s my opinion that Cheapest RAM and Best RAM are two different things: the cheapest ram is just that – the lowest priced generic memory you can buy. The best ram is the memory upgrade you buy from a store you are comfortable with and trust. This could be the Apple Store, (definitely not the cheapest memory) or any of the honest memory stores I list. If you want the cheapest RAM, go to <a href="http://www.craigslist.com">craigslist</a> or <a href="http://www.ebay.com">ebay</a> or <a href="http://www.kijiji.com">kijiji</a> and find some ram. Maybe you’ll get a bargain, and maybe you won’t and the memory you buy will not work, shut down your computer or worse. But it was cheap, right?</p>

<p>Forget the cheapest memory and go with the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="best memory you can buy">best memory you can buy</a>. You’ll be happier with your purchase over the long time you use and  own your desktop computer</p>

		<div class="post-content"><p><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com">Ram Prices drop over time</a>. When first introduced <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">new memory modules</a> are very expensive to buy, and in some cases the memory upgrades can cost as much as the computer the ram upgrade is designed to be compatible with.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MX5YWI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001MX5YWI"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1276" title="Cheapest Computer RAM Prices" alt="Best Priced Computer RAM" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-12.34.11-PM.png" width="522" height="208" /></a></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MX5YWI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001MX5YWI">Best Computer RAM for Apple</a></strong></p>

<p>One example of this recently is the newer Mac Pro Computers that were released earlier this summer in 2010. When first introduced to add 64gb of RAM to a Apple Mac Pro would cost you just shy of $3000, but in the last six months the ram prices for Apple Mac Pro have dropped and at time of writing this article are now priced at a much more affordable (yet still pretty pricey) $1900. You save $1000 on your memory upgrades just by waiting for time and demand to increase which of course, reduces the price.</p>

<p>Another example of this would be when the iMac DDR3 models were released in 2008. To buy ram from Apple at the time it would cost you as much as the iMac itself to upgrade to the 8GB of RAM that the Apple iMacs could handle, but in 2011 ram upgrades for the same Apple iMac computers are now a much more affordable and cost just $110 for 8GB of DDR3 memory for the same computer. That’s a 90% ram price change in just a few years.</p>

<p>So if you want to <strong>save money on ram upgrades,</strong> one option is to just wait as the ram price trends do indicate year over year that except for rare instances, memory upgrade prices drop over time regardless of whether you need memory for an Apple Computer or Dell or HP computer as well the cheapest RAM is the memory you don’t buy today but make do with the standard ram that is already installed in your notebook or desktop computer. Most computers today come with enough memory for most consumer based tasks such as facebook, email, web browsing and so forth. If you’re a power computer or earn your living with your computer then it’s probably best to buy ram today regardless of cost as over time you will benefit from the memory upgrade and ignore any ram price trends.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="what is the cost of memory">What is the cost of memory?</a></strong> That’s the number 1 question I answer day in and day out here on ramseeker as this is all I do – track and monitor ram and memory upgrade prices from reputable third part vendors.</p>

<p>But if you think about it and save for the fewer higher end applications that require 32GB of RAM or more, memory upgrades are so cheap that the default thing to do when you get a new computer is to fill it with ram.</p>

<p>Let’s take the MacBook as an example:  Depending on where you buy your MacBook from the price will be about $1000 for a new MacBook today. RAM prices to completely fill your MacBook with memory, replacing the factory memory (which you can sell for even further price reductions) will cost you just under $50. That’s 1/20th the cost of the computer you want to upgrade or about the same price as a dinner out for two.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0041OSQ9S/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0041OSQ9S"><img title="Hard Drive Prices" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-11.44.01-AM.png" alt="Best Priced Hard Drives" width="261" height="318" /></a></p>

<div>
</div>

<p>But for the $50 ram upgrade you get the performance you deserve from your thousand dollar purchase for your MacBook that you paid for as with a maxed out MacBook (or any computer for that matter) you benefit from faster application launch times, more applications open at the same time and an overall feel that your very expensive notebook is just overall a faster mac with the maximum ram installed when compared to the performance you get with  the memory configuration directly from Apple.</p>

<p>The best part is that a year or so from now or whenever you are ready to upgrade your next computer, ram prices will continue to drop, or at very least the memory module size will get bigger so you get more gigabytes for the same memory upgrade dollar.</p>

<p>Considering how cheap ram has become over the years, I can strongly suggest you max out the memory on your computer. RAM is so cheap right now.</p>

<p>I also don’t list every company claiming to be an expert on memory. With experience comes a bit of knowledge and I know enough not to list every site that sells memory online as all it takes is a domain name and some ram to ship to open an online memory store and start pitching memory upgrades online. Instead I have opted to compare memory prices from a select few memory stores you can actually trust to sell you memory at a fair price and with outstanding support and still help you save money on Apple memory than if you had bought it from Apple directly, which in my opinion is way overpriced for what it is.</p>

<p>I update ram prices daily (if not hourly) so you are sure to get the right price and a fair price on your next ram upgrade from a selection of memory vendors that you can trust to offer excellent support both pre-sale and post-sale. You will also find the lowest prices for memory listed on the front page, because let’s face it – most of you look for the cheapest memory you can buy and no the best overall price but hey, it’s your money – I just help you get a good price on ram upgrades.</p>

<p>I have created a <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com">list of memory stores</a></strong> which will help you when you want to buy memory at a cheap price.</p>

<p>When shopping for Apple Memory, I’m the first to admit that it can be confusing to determine what memory you need to buy for your specific Apple Computer.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MX5YWI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001MX5YWI"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1239" title="Cheapest MacBook Pro 8GB Kits" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-11.02.05-AM1.png" alt="Best 8GB MacBook Pro RAM" width="312" height="296" /></a></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MX5YWI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001MX5YWI">Cheapest 8GB RAM</a></strong></p>

<p>I list memory by model type and then by memory type, so for the current Apple iMac models I list memory like this : <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/iMac_(DDR3_1333)/" title="iMac DDR3 memory">iMac (DDR3 1333)</a>. This means that the memory prices on this page are for iMac and are the newer DDR3 1333Mhz required for the 2010 iMacs. I could list memory prices by year, but this does not work in all cases: 2010 Mac Pros models can accept both DDR3 1066MHz memory as well as DDR3 1333Mhz SDRAM dimms so listing memory by year does not work or apply.</p>

<p>Most memory stores offer either an application that you can download and run for your computer which will tell you what RAM you need, but these tend to be geared towards th PC market over the Mac.  Memory configurators are another easy way to determine what Apple memory you need as all you do is select what Apple computer model (you will still need to know this, at minumum) you need to upgrade and then the memory configuration system returns a list of compatible memory upgrades for your Apple Mac.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.macsales.com" title="memory configurator">Other World Computing</a> is one of the more mac-specific memory resellers and their website is designed to easily help you find the memory you need. The other vendors tend to use the memory configuarators and  such, which are good but you still need to be able to determine what specific Apple computer you own or want to upgrade memory for.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-1548159-10375052">Crucial Technology </a>is another memory store which despite it’s more corporate feel does offer an Apple Memory Upgrade Tool to help you determine the memory upgrades you need for your Mac.</p>

<p>Both of these memory stores offer a mac specific page or pages dedicated to upgrading the memory and ram on your Apple Computer with ease and make it easy for you to determine what ram to buy for your mac model</p>

<p>No. You do not have to purchase or buy additional memory from Apple.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1239" title="Cheapest MacBook Pro 8GB Kits" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-11.02.05-AM1.png" alt="Best 8GB MacBook Pro RAM" width="312" height="296" /></a></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW">Best MacBook Pro Memory</a></strong></p>

<p>In fact, I have made an entire <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com">list of memory upgrade stores</a></strong> other than Apple that you can safely and easily buy memory upgrades for your Apple Computer that offers a much better value than if you were to buy memory upgrades direct from the manufacturer.</p>

<p>To be sure, buying Apple memory upgrades from Apple directly offers benefits that others on my list can’t compete with,  and that’s probably support issues. If you have Apple memory bought from Apple directly and installed (usually at time of your Apple computer purchase) all at the same time there is less of chance of trouble when and if the time comes that you do need support for your Apple computer. If you have Apple memory installed at the factory, Apple cannot use the excuse that your computer problems are due to bad ram from third party memory vendors. The problem with buying memory directly from Apple you will pay dearly for the pleasure when you compare ram prices from Apple against <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="much cheaper memory">much cheaper memory</a> upgrade options where you can save up to half price when you compare third party memory to the Apple Memory.</p>

<p>If you stick to a trusted memory store that’s been in business for over a decade and specializes in Apple ram upgrades you will still get the benefits a ram upgrade can bring but for much less money than had you bought the RAM from Apple directly. Most (actually, all) memory stores I track prices for and monitor offer lifetime warranty and have been in business for at very least, a decade and  in some cases like OWC, over twenty years selling you memory upgrades for your Apple Mac computer regardless of whether you’re in the market to upgrade an older Mac or maximize the RAM on a new Apple Computer.</p>

<p>Buy RAM from a <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com">trusted memory store</a> and you’ll save money on your next Apple RAM Upgrade.</p>

<p>It’s 2011 and most, but not all Apple computers currently shipping today accept the more modern DDR 1333Mhz memory upgrades, at least when it comes to currently shipping desktop computers such as the Apple iMac or Mac Pro. But at the time of writing this the MacBook,  MacBook Pro and Mac Mini Apple computers all still use and require <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="ddr3 1066mhz">DDR3 1066MHz memory upgrades</a>:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1239" title="Cheapest MacBook Pro 8GB Kits" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-11.02.05-AM1.png" alt="Best 8GB MacBook Pro RAM" width="312" height="296" /></a></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW">Apple 8GB DDR3 SDRAM On Sale</a></strong></p>

<p>MacBook Pro DDR3 1066 memory upgrades are priced by memory stores either as <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_Pro_KITS_(1066_DDR3)/" title="macbook pro memory upgrade kits">MacBook Pro  memory upgrade kits </a>or <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_Pro_(1066_DDR3)/" title="macbook pro ram upgrades">MacBook Pro memory upgrade modules</a> which are priced individually, but you will need to <strong>upgrade your MacBook Pro</strong> to the maximum 8GB (for current models) in pairs. I track and monitor memory for both as some memory  stores like to sell memory by individual module, while others prefer to offer memory on sale for Apple computers  in memory upgrade kits and sometimes even offer you a bit of a deal when compared against just buying memory individually.</p>

<p>MacBook notebook computers from Apple require the exact same DDR3 1066MHz sodimms as the MacBook Pro’s but in the case of the MacBooks, you are limited to a maximum of 4GB of RAM when you need to upgrade MacBook memory to the maximum memory to get the most performance out of your Apple computer. And as the MacBook Pro models I mentioned above, you can buy MacBook RAM upgrades as either <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_(1066_DDR3)/">MacBook memory modules</a> or <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_KITS_(1066_DDR3)/">MacBook memory upgrade kits</a>.</p>

<p>Apple iMac Models also can accept DDR3 1066 memory as well, but this applies to older iMacs as the current iMac lineup from Apple requires the DDR3 1333MHz memory upgrades. But if you have an <a href="http://www.lowendmac.com" title="older iMac">older iMac</a> you can still benefit from a memory upgrade using DDR3 1066Mhz memory upgrades that are sold in either individual <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/iMac_(DDR3_1066)/">iMac memory</a> or as <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/iMac_KITS_(DDR3_1066)/" title="imac memory upgrade kits">iMac memory kits.</a></p>

<p>DDR3 1066Mhz memory upgrades are cheaper in part than have been in the past due to the fact in part that faster memory upgrades are being introduced to be compatible with the faster Apple computers, but if there ever was a time to buy Apple DDR3 1066MHz RAM this is it, as the early adopters have paid the premium for this type of Apple Memory Upgrade leaving you to save money on Apple DDR3 1066 RAM.</p>

<p>When shopping for RAM you essentially have two choices when you are wanting to upgrade your computer with ram and memory. It doesn’t matter whether you have a notebook computer or a desktop computer you really only have two decisions to make when you’re ready to buy RAM.</p>

<p>[table id=1 /]<br />

<p><strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com">Do want to save money on RAM? </a></strong></p>

<p>**Do you want to buy the best ram brand you can buy? **</p>

<p>That’s it and under most conditions you can’t  have both. But what you can do is buy generic ram which is the cheaper RAM of the two and is also the ram price I list and track as every visitor to ramseeker is looking to buy the best ram at the best price, so generic it is. This way,  I am comparing prices on ram for the cheapest ram you can buy for your Apple Computer.</p>

<p>If you want to <a href="http://youbuythebest.com">buy the best </a>ram brand, buy the RAM from Apple.  But you’ll pay. Oh boy will you pay… but you do get peace of mind in that the best ram brand will be from the computer manufacturer. In Apple’s case it’s rare that they actually make the RAM so you’re probably buying Apple branded memory as opposed to memory that apple actually makes. My last Macbook came with Samsung memory installed if I recall correctly.</p>

<p>Most memory stores today carry both a cheaper generic ram, which runs fine for most applications and is much  much cheaper memory than the name brand stuff. But for those to drive a mercedes over a chevy, they’re willing to pay for the extra money and buy the name brand memory and the stores I list ram prices for also carry the name brand stuff too.</p>

<p>To summarize, when shopping for RAM you have options. You can <strong><a href="http:///www.ramseeker.com" title="save money on ram">save money on ram</a></strong> and buy the cheap ram or you can spend a little more and buy name brand ram  too.</p>

<p>Ultimately the choice is yours to make.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2010/09/imac-memory/">iMac Memory</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8IO6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8IO6">Cheapest Apple iMac</a></strong></p>

<p>I’ve just realized that I have been tracking ram prices on <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="imac memory"><strong>iMac Memory</strong></a> for over 13 years now starting with the very first iMac, that teal green model with the round mouse that’s so old now you have to wonder if it’s even worthwhile ugrading thew ram on the original Apple iMac.</p>

<p>I tend to focus on the later iMacs models as I’ve found that’s where the demand is and it only makes sense, I think. Chances are, if you’re going to buy an iMac you’ll want to buy a new iMac as technology marches on and the iMacs just keep getting cheaper and yet better too so it’s my suggestion is when you buy an iMac and maybe it’s for back to school or you’re buying an iMac for Christmas (it’ll be here sooner than you think) and the time to upgrade iMac RAM is right when you buy the iMac.</p>

<p>You can ugrade <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/iMac_(DDR3_1333)/" title="iMac Memory">iMac Memory</a> in one of two ways: The first being to favor simple over cheap and just order your iMac from Apple and max out the iMac RAM from Apple at the same time. If time is money then this is definitely the easiest way to go, as you’re buying an apple product and filling it with apple branded ram at the same time.  The only problem  with this technique is hoo boy, will you pay. Apple RAM has consistently been higher priced than if you bought iMac RAM elsewhere. The savings can be in the hundereds of dollars, especially when you factor in the fact that 16gb of RAM is a lot of RAM for the iMac and it’s a newer technology and we all know the newer bigger ram is the most expensive  RAM you can buy.</p>

<p>The better solution is to buy Apple authorized generic  (or name brand to, but you’ll save less) from memory stores that have been in business for more than a decade and have been selling and suppprting iMac RAM since the beginning of the Apple iMac’s existence.</p>

<p>Heck, even the folks at the Apple Store suggest ramseeker as your destination for RAM because Apple only stocks new and in production products – if you’re looking to uprgrade an older Apple iMac you’re out of luck .</p>

<p>But the good new is new or old Apple iMac, I’ve got a selection of Memory stores that yes, will be happy for your business but actually support and sell memory specific to Apple’s  own memory specifications and the kicker is the iMac RAM from these guys is gauranateed to work!</p>

<p>We all know a gaurantee might not mean much depending on the source but this is just one more reason ramseeker should be your first stop when shoppping for iMac RAM. I don’t list every memory store possible. I only list memory stores that back their product with a gaurantee and have been in business for over a decade (some, two decades) and know RAM for iMacs like the backs of their hands.</p>

<p>That’s how you get the best deal on iMac RAM.  Comparing ram prices from reputable memory stores and buying iMac RAM from a memory store you can trust.</p>

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/macbook_pro"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-386" title="Apple MacBook RAM" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2010-09-28-at-11.06.31-AM.png" alt="Macbook Memory Upgrades" width="478" height="302" /></a>You do know that it’s pretty easy to install the ram you buy from third part memory stores yourself, yes? In fact it’s not too hard at all to <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="install ram macook pro 2010">install RAM in MacBook Pro 2010</a></strong> models at all.</p>

<p>You do need a few things to start, like a clean static free work surface and a small philips screwdriver but other than some time to take your time and go slowly you can install MacBook Pro ram yourself and save yourself any unneccesary installation fee.</p>

<p>In fact, it’s so easy that Apple has <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1270" title="how to install macbook pro ram">instructions on MacBook Pro RAM installations</a> and upgrades so it’s not just due to the fact that I’m familiar with ram upgrades, the good folks at Apple think you’re up to the task too.</p>

<p>The very first thing you need to do is to shut off your computer. Don’t put it to sleep but really shut off your computer. You don’t need anything to be powered up when you’re installing or replacing ram upgrades.</p>

<p>Then you’ll need to close the MacBook Pro and flip the MacBook Pro over and remove the bottom cover with the ten screws that are holding it in place.</p>

<p>Once you’ve got the screws out and put aside safely, you want to be sure to discharge any static electricity build up that might happen by touching something metal on the MacBook Pro.</p>

<p>With the cover off, you’ll see the RAM modules from the factory right there. You don’t have to remove any hard drives or anything. What you do have to do is push the levers that hold the factory ram out so that the memory modules pop out at a 45 degree angle and then slowly remove the ram by pulling lightly the ram out of the memory socket.  Do the same for the bottom ram module too.</p>

<p>Now that you have empty RAM slots you’re ready to install your memory. There’s notches on the ram modules that line up with the memory upgrade sockets, so there’s really no way you can screw this up. With the notches lined up, insert the ram into the memory upgrade slot at about a 45 degree angle. You may have to push a bit as those memory sockets are designed to be a tight fit. Then all you do is push downwards on the ram so that it’s sitting flat an parallel to your desktop and the two little springs should click into place to hold the memory upgrade in.</p>

<p>Then just do the same again for for the second or top memory upgrade socket for the MacBook Pro – line up the notch, install the ram at 45 degrees until the ram is seated in the slot and push down until the two little tabs lock the memory module in place.</p>

<p>Replace the bottom with the ten screws  and you’re done. Turn the MacBook Pro over, press the power button and the operating system will automatically recognize your new maximum ram for MacBook Pro.</p>

<p>If you’re going to go through all the trouble of installing ram yourself, I suggest buying <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_Pro_KITS_(1066_DDR3)/" title="8gb macbook pro ram">8GB MacBook Pro RAM</a></strong> and maxing out the MacBook Pro 2010.</p>

<p>Cheap RAM has to be one of the biggest ways people find ramseeker. They type ‘cheap ram, or cheapest ram, or where can I buy cheap ram and  search engines supply you with an answer: and here you are <img src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p>I know, you’re thinking that there’s lots of stores that advertise the cheapest RAM and at times they do offer the best price on ram (this is assuming you mean best price being equal to lowest price) but I’ve found that for the most part the low price leaders for memory either do one of two things after a while:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The cheapest ram dealers go out of business. I’ve seen it at least a few times. These new vendors come on the market and state total domination but then they realize that they’ve pretty much priced themselves out of the market.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They give up trying to be the lowest price on ram upgrades because sometimes with that also comes the joys of the internet and sometimes the cost of a sale frankly,isn’t worth the effort as margins are cut so low it’s hard to make any money on RAM if you have to answer a million pre-sale and post sale support questions. Sometimes these low price memory stores realize that after a while, it’s best to be priced higher up. Less sales,  perhaps but also less grief and support costs too.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Lastly there’s one more reason why you should make ramseeker your number 1 destination when shopping for memory upgrades. I get special discounts for you that you only can get by shopping through the ramseeker system.  These memory stores can offer a better deal to ramseeker readers because they know they will be rewarded with better sales which makes up for any profit margins they might lose had they not offered the ramseeker memory discount.</p>

<p>With ramseeker you get the best deal on ram upgrades from Memory stores you can trust year after year after year  to help you find the <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="cheapest ram">cheapest ram</a></strong> upgrades for your PC or Mac and the support that you want and expect too.</p>

<div style="float: right; margin-right: 5px;">
</div>

<p><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="black macbook ram">Can the Black MacBook take 8GB of RAM</a>?  The short answer is no, you cannot install 8gb of MacBook RAM into a black macbook, regardless of age. If it’s black, there’s no way  you can install 8GB of RAM into the black notebook from Apple Computer.</p>

<p>Now,  if Apple releases a new black macbook then I’ll have to update this article at a later date and revise my comment above, but for the time being the maximum ram a black macbook can take is up to 4GB of RAM for the later MacBook models.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8IO6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8IO6"><img title="8GB MacBook RAM" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-12.41.00-PM.png" alt="8GB RAM for MacBook" width="312" height="284" /></a></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8IO6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8IO6">8GB MacBook RAM</a></strong></p>

<p>When the black macbooks were first released in 2006 and subsequently 2007, the maximum ram supported by Apple for these MacBooks – both white and black – was a maximum of 2GB of RAM officially supported. But then some third party stores did some testing and found that even though the official maximum RAM for the MacBooks was 2GB this was before 2GB memory for MacBooks was even available so what they found was that even though the official maximum RAM was 2GB you could install 4gb of RAM with 2x2gb memory modules in these early macbook models. The problem  was the OS and  motherboard was only designed to accept up to 3GB tops so even though you could get 4gb of RAM in the MacBooks only 3gb would show up. So if you have an older black macbook, you may be able to get up to 3gb to show up when you buy 2x2gB memory modules for MacBook.</p>

<p>Then with later MacBook models (again, black or white) that were released in 2007 with the faster design and increased standard memory you could now see up to 6GB of RAM in a black notebook from Apple even though again the official stance from Apple was that a maximum 4GB of ram was supported. This in part is again due to the fact that 4gb ram chips for MacBooks came on the scene after the release of the MacBook models in 2007 so at the time 4gb was indeed the maximum ram for your black macbook.  But later tests found that if you installed 4gb in one of the two ram upgrade slots and another 2gb memory module in the second ram slot the macbook could use and recognize all 6gb of installed RAM. Technically, it’s not supported  by Apple but it works.</p>

<p>So although you can’t install 8GB of RAM into a Black MacBook, you may be able to max out your black MacBook RAM with either 2GB or 3GB or 6gb of RAM depending on what specific Macbook model you have.</p>

<p>The folks at OWC have a great resource that explains exactly<a href="http://eshop.macsales.com/shop/memory/MacBook/DDR2/" title="black macbook ram"> how much ram the black macbooks can accept </a>and use. I recommend you refer to it if you have any further questions on upgrading black macbook memory to the maximum allowed.</p>

<p>When shopping for ram or memory upgrades for Apple MacBook Pro computer models it’s hard sometimes to figure out what exactly is the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="best macbook pro memory">best memory upgrade for the MacBook Pro</a>.</p>

<p>MacBook Pro Memory comes from many different memory stores and is available in a selection of manufacturers such as Samsung or Micron MacBook Pro RAM and then you also need to consider whether the generic ram might be an option for your MBP as well.</p>

<p>Once you have determined whether you want generic or name brand MacBook Pro Memory the next question that tends to arise is where are you planning to or going to buy MacBook Pro RAM and at what price should you expect to pay for MacBook Pro RAM?</p>

<p>I  tend to track and monitor prices for all Apple Memory and I usually look for the best price I can find, and by best price I mean the lowest price as this site compares, tracks and lists Apple Memory prices the visitors I see tend to gravitate towards the memory that’s priced the lowest I can find.</p>

<p>Personally, I don’t think this is the best way to go about shopping for ram and I’ve stated in the past and am probably repeating myself, but  I think the real value in RAM is to buy ram from a store you can trust with an excellent return policy and that sells ram that’s guaranteed to work in your computer, whether it’s a MacBook Pro or some other memory type you really just want to buy ram that’s  priced reasonably and works in your MacBook Pro. That’s the best deal.</p>

<p>But, not everybody thinks or shops like I do and  if you’re not caring about ram prices than  I doubt you’ll ever see my site or read this. You’ll just buy ram from Apple probably and you do get the fact that when you buy Apple RAM you get great serivce, warranty and all the rest but the bummer is it will cost you a lot more money for essentially the same ram than if you bought ram from a trusted third party apple memory store.</p>

<p>And that’s where I come in. I list the lowest prices on MacBook Pro RAM and Memory but I also list the higher priced brand name RAM and Memory too as it’s my belief that the consumer should be able to make an educated choice about buying MacBook Pro RAM from memory stores they can be assured will offer the prices and support they expect and deserve as a potential customer.</p>

<p>The best price on MacBook Pro RAM depends on so many factors, and the last one you should base your memory buying decisions on is actually the price you pay at the checkout.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2010/08/sell-your-macbook-memory/">Sell Your MacBook Memory</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>Did you know that to offset costs of a memory upgrade you could sell your old memory? This makes sure that when you replace the old ram with the new ram, regardless of computer make or model, that your ram upgrade will cost less and it doesn’t matter what computer you have. You can sell your memory and the result is a cheaper upgrade for you over all.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/memorylady1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-411" title="scientist" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/memorylady1.jpg" alt="" width="423" height="284" /></a></p>

<p>Now with the MacBook (or MacBook Pro too) you should definitely be interested in this as it lets you recoup at least some value from the factory ram that you paid apple for (and probably too much too, but that’s an article for another day) when you’re ready to upgrade your MacBook RAM. And all you have to do is sell your MacBook Memory to a reputable memory store.</p>

<p>Some places like Crucial don’t want to buy back your old MacBook RAM, they just want to sell you new ram at new prices but some of the other online stores will happily buy back your old RAM. What do they do with it? I’m going to guess some vendors re-use parts as RAM is really (and I’m no expert in ram manufacturing so bear with me) but RAM modules usually have more than one chip soldered to the memory board which might be of use to make bigger ram chips or otherwise re-use your ram.</p>

<p>But we’re concerned today with where to <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com">sell your MacBook Memory</a> to, because otherwise you’ll just toss it into a junk drawer on your desk, or sell it for pennies on ebay or craigslist and when you do that you get all the fun that comes with being a private seller. But when you sell it to an authorized ram dealer, you get a fair value and you also get a better deal on your new ram effectively making your ram upgrade cheaper, which is the whole point or focus of ramseeker – getting you the right price on your next ram upgrade.</p>

<p>So who buys RAM? I know of a few Memory stores that will offer you cash for your old RAM and they are: SMS Assembly, RAMJET and OEMPCWORLD will all buy your MacBook Memory when you’re ready to upgrade. These are the few memory stores for Apple Memory that I am aware of that will buy back your old RAM from your Mac. If you’re aware of any other memory sellers who do this, leave a comment and I’ll update my list.</p>

<p>As far as prices you’ll get for your old MacBook RAM, <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/oempcworld">OEMPCWORLD</a> states that they’ll knock off another 20% off the price of new MacBook RAM and for <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/ramjet">RAMJET</a>, they’ve got handy list of <a href="http://ramjet.com/rebate.asp">ram price trade in values for mac</a>.</p>

<p>I hope</p>

But before you  can add ram to MacBook Pro you have to buy a MacBook Pro and I got asked this question today so I thought rather than reply via email that others might have the very same question too.</p>

<p>I just don’t get why you would pay full MSRP for a MacBook Pro when with about three seconds work you can get a better deal or even the <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26x%3D0%26ref_%3Dnb_sb_noss%26y%3D0%26field-keywords%3Dmacbook%2520pro%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957" title="best price on a macbook pro">best price on a MacBook Pro</a></strong>.</p>

<p>[table id=14 /]<br />
Apple’s pretty fussy on who they allow to sell their products and you will rarely find any silly deals on MacBook Pros for current shipping MacBook Pros as Apple has something that they call MAP or minimum advertised price, so if you’re a store selling MacBook Pros you can’t just slap any old price on there. This keeps the new MacBook Pro prices all the same for the most part.</p>

<p>But like anything in life there’s always exceptions. <img src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> One way to get a <strong>deal on a MacBook Pro</strong> is to buy a MacBook Pro from Amazon. Because Amazon  is so well known, and  even more so than even buying a MacBook Pro from Apple –  you know you’re going to get a good deal on MacBook Pro just because Amazon controls so much of the online marketplace. Amazon sells so much more than books these days and you can buy not only a MacBook Pro but you could also <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="buy ram">buy RAM</a> and a case at the same time and Amazon has to be the best place for bundling MacBook Pros with other stuff  you might need and they also recommend other MacBook Pros or even MacBooks for a better deal than what you’d pay from the Apple Store.</p>

<p>I don’t know but to me it makes no sense to pay full load for the very same computer just to have the privilege of buying your MacBook Pro from the Apple Store when you’re just a few clicks away from saving money on a MacBook Pro when you buy one from Amazon. Even if  you only get a small discount you still get great customer service and a MacBook Pro for your hard earned money, which is what you wanted anyway: **The best price on a MacBook Pro **</p>

<div style="float: right; margin-right: 5px;">
  Tracking RAM Prices from Crucial for Mac is pretty easy to do as there&#8217;s only four (well, OK, five) Apple Computer models that currently ship that you can add more ram to: <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/iMac_(DDR3_1333)/">Apple iMac Memory</a>, <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_Pro_KITS_(1066_DDR3)/">MacBook Pro Memory</a>, <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_(1066_DDR3)/">MacBook Memory</a> and<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/Mac_Pro_RAM_Upgrade_Kits_DDR3_1333_with_8GB_RAM/"> Mac Pro Memory </a>are the best selling RAM from Crucial memory as well as the other vendors I monitor and track prices as they each deserve their own articles so for this one I just want to Talk about Crucial Technology.
</div>

<div style="float: right; margin-right: 5px;">
  Welcome to the only site that <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com">tracks and monitors crucial memory upgrades</a> as just one of the memory vendors. I will confess that at ramseeker I do specialize in Apple Memory from Crucial more so than the PC stuff but over time I want to change that and start to track crucial ram for Dell, Apple, HP and compaq computers just to name a few of the major windows computer manufacturers.One thing that Crucial does carry (and other memory stores are coming online with) are SSD drives which are essentially faster hard drives that offer no moving parts so there&#8217;s less chance you&#8217;re going to need data recovery if your hard drive crashes. SSD drives are quite similar in design to flash memory drives for your digital camera, but now you can use them in modern computers, with most uses being in notebook or netbook computers. Currently, SSD hard drives from Crucial are still a bit pricey as they are new technology and with any new technology to be a leader &#8211; you&#8217;ll pay. The reward is much faster start up and operating time which result in a snappier feel overall as compared to hard drives that have essentially worked like record player or turntables. There&#8217;s moving parts that can get damaged and take all your data down too.
</div>

<p>But back to RAM from Crucial; There was a time when Crucial RAM was really expensive. Really expensive – more than what Apple or Dell charged expensive, but over time you’re just paying a minimum fee for the crucial brand as opposed to generic ram. Crucial RAM just works. Their site, when you order RAM from Crucial is a bit dull in my opinion and is a bit monotone and there’ no where for the eye to go when you first land on the page. I’d be promoting the Crucial RAM Configurator much much more, than what they are. But Crucial’s a big company and changes probably take years if not months to make and int the mean time, they do offer more than one easy way to buy ram from Crucial which is really all you want: Either you know your computer model so use the menu system to select your brand/line/model number to get the right ram for your computer guranateed (as they like to advertise) or alternately you can download a computer program that you can install on your computer that will scan your computer and spit out the right ram for your computer – again, gauranteed.</p>

<p>Crucial offers a good product a a good price. Crucial is not the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/#lowest">lowest price on ram</a> you can find but they offer a pretty good deal on ram and memory upgrades most days and carry ram and memory for every computer every made too. You could do worse than **<a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-1548159-10375052">buying RAM from Crucial Technology </a><br />

<p>If you’re looking to buy ram (or memory) you’re closer to your destination but not quite, as I don’t sell any RAM. Not one stick,never have and after 13 years at this it’s probably safe to say that I never will. What I do though is help you get the best deal on RAM for you that’s right for you and yes, I do advertise the lowest ram prices for Mac, or even cheapest PC RAM it’s just because like you, most are just looking to buy the cheapest RAM you can find. You want a deal on RAM memory as it can be expensive for what it is and it’s hard to measure performance with RAM. Yes, your computer is going to run faster and smoother and there won’t be as many crashes or blue screens of death but still, it’s not like say adding a hard drive where when you do that you get a neat little window that says wow, look at all the free space you have to fill up with more and more data.</p>

<p>But with RAM, cheap or no the effects and benefits can be less but still allow you to work faster and with less hassle from computers, which I’m sure I don’t have to tell you: computers are great when they work and are a big pain in the..well, you know when they don’t. And that’ where adding RAM does offer the greatest value: There’s less chance of user frustration when you fill up your computer with RAM regardless of the model, you still get more work done faster and with less grief and misery. That’s where RAM upgrades really shine.</p>

<p>But RAM’s not cheap. Especially at first when it’s released. I remember about a year ago, to fill up your iMac to 8GB (which at the time was the maximum RAM you could buy) it cost just as much as the iMac itself, which is just nuts. Thankfully as demand and supply increase, ram prices drop like a stone and quickly.</p>

<p>The trouble with cheap ram is that you could be setting your self up for customer service headaches if you buy ram from memory stores that don’t offer a few essentials: A secure website to order from – It’s 2010 and indentity theft is real and scary. Do you know who you’re sending your credit card information to? And how about a guarantee? When some sellers of memory offer ram at the cheapest prices, they do so at the cost of customer service. Some sales are final or they make it so hard to deal with returns and shipping that the few bucks that you saved on the cheapest ram might not feel like much of a savings if you can’t get support if you have trouble for your memory purchase.</p>

<p>Which is why I always suggest that you buy RAM from the stores I list as they all have been selling memory upgrades for at least as long as I have been tracking ram prices and that my friends has a value you can’t put a sticker price on. Some are big corportations and some are smaller small businesses and some even specialize in just Apple Memory and don’t bother with PC RAM at all. But do yourself a favor and forget the cheapest RAM and buy the RAM that’s guaranteed to work from a memory store you can trust.</p>

<p>That’s the real value in my opinion. But, not to disappoint – here’s a list of the <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/#lowest">cheapest mac ram</a></strong> and the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/pc/index.php#lowest">cheapest PC RAM</a>. Enjoy.</p>

<p>Wow. I’ve already written about how I think that dropping almost 3 large for computer RAM on Mac Pros right now is just flushing money down the toilet. If I know one thing when it comes to ram prices, especially for the Mac Pro RAM Prices and it’s this:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ZR4M6I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B003ZR4M6I"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1286" title="Best Mac PRo" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-12.44.53-PM.png" alt="Cheap Apple Mac Pro" width="188" height="263" /></a></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ZR4M6I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B003ZR4M6I">Cheapest Mac Pro</a></strong></p>

<p><strong>RAM Prices for Mac Pro will drop over time</strong>. Even with the newer 1333 MHz RAM for the Mac Pros it was only about a week ago or so that you would have to pay just a touch under $3,000 for Mac Pro 64GB but as I write this the ram prices drop and drop – especially for the bigger chips such as 64GB as there’s more room for price drops. Let’s say a 4gb memory upgrade module drops in price of ten dollars. It’s possible. If you do the math you save ten dollars for 4GB so you’ll save $160 assuming the same discount on the larger Mac Pro Memory Kit. Now, technically you’d need 8x8GB to get to 64Gb so my example is flawed from the start but not really. With few exceptions, 1gb costs ten bucks than 2gb will cost twenty and 4gb will be at $40. There might be a small ‘pricing discount’ to get you to buy ram and the 4GB chip might have a price of $39, but we’re splitting hairs.</p>

<p>Let’s have a look at today’s prices for Mac Pro. And these are the Best Mac Pro Memory Prices at time of writing so you should always check for current Apple Mac Pro RAM Prices as your mileage may vary. <img src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><br />

<p>As you will see, the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/Mac_Pro_RAM_Upgrade_Kits_DDR3_1333_with_4GB_RAM-8gb/" title="8gb mac pro ram">8gb Mac Pro  RAM costs $272.</a> The price for <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/Mac_Pro_RAM_Upgrade_Kits_DDR3_1333_with_4GB_RAM-16gb/" title="16gb mac pro ram">16GB Mac Pro RAM</a>? about double at $556, and double again for <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/Mac_Pro_RAM_Upgrade_Kits_DDR3_1333_with_4GB_RAM-32gb/" title="32gb mac pro ram">32gb of RAM for Mac Pro </a>(actually it seems you pay a bit of a premium for the bigger ram for Mac Pro in this example)</p>

<p>Anyway, the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com#lowest" title="best ram prices mac pro">best price for Apple Mac Pro RAM</a> is what you can afford really as the Mac Pros offer loads of options for memory upgrades and this chart is just a sampling of  the memory upgrade possibilities. With  the new 2010 Apple Mac Pro machines you can use 2GB, 4GB, or even 8GB to get to the maximum memory configurtation at the best price that suits your needs and also considering your specific Mac Pro models as some still take the older 1066 DDR RAM and to make things even more confusing not all Mac Pro’s will use the Max RAM of 64GB. It’s a good place to start to see what specific Mac Pro you have and what Mac Pro processor speed and then do some research on Mac Pro RAM Prices from there.</p>

You only need a philips screwdriver and a clear workspace that’s free from static electricity and you can install ram for HP notebooks yourself you don’t need to hire any computer shop or geeks to install the notebook ram yourself.</p>

<p>[table id=15 /]There’s a good chance your memory upgrades for your new HP notebook require DDR3 1333Mhz RAM, especially if your processor is Intel i3, i5 or i7 which are popular processor for HP computers in 2011. Below are the current ram prices available for HP notebooks:</p>

<p>But first you need to buy the RAM for your HP notebook and here’s something I’ll share in my 13 years or working with ram and memory: you can buy ram from third party memory stores or memory manufacturers that’s just as good but this HP memory offers one thing that buying directly from HP can’t match: RAM is cheaper when you buy it from trusted memory shops and stores. Don’t pay too much for RAM or Memory for your HP notebook. Let’s take a look at the currrent HP notebook lineup and I’ll tell you what RAM you need, and where you can get the best deal on HP Memory too.</p>

<p><strong>HP Mini 110 PC-series RAM and Memory Upgrades</strong></p>

<p>The HP Mini 110 1100 series is a wee little netbook that’s a cheap way to get into portable computing and is more than enough but it doesn’t come with enough RAM to run any applications really. It can be upgraded to more RAM by replacing the 1GB of RAM with a 2gb PC2 DDR2 6400 sdram sodimm which will allow your Mini PC from HP to run faster.</p>

<p><strong>HP Mini 210 PC series Memory and RAM upgrades</strong></p>

<p>The Mini 210 is yet another netbook from HP that comes in a few different configurations but there’s two things that are standard across the HP Mini 210 series, and that’s the fact that you can replace the 1GB DDR RAM and add a bigger 2GB DDR memory module for the HP Mini 210 PC series.</p>

<p><strong>HP Mini 310 PC series Memory and RAM upgrades</strong></p>

<p>The maximum memory for the 310 series netbooks from HP is 3gb of RAM  and to get to the maximum RAM you have to add to the 1gb that comes from the factory and is non removeable ram and buy 2gb ram for the 310 Mini series from HP to give you a maximum of 3GB RAM by installing 2gb DDR3 SDRAM sodimms.</p>

<p><strong>HP Pavilion G42-200 series notbook RAM and Memory upgrades</strong></p>

<p>The HP Pavilion G42-200xx series of notebook computer offers two memory upgrade slots that will accept and take  DDR3 PC1066 SDRAM sodimms and you can install two 4gB ddr3 sdram sodimms to get to the maximum memory for the HP Pavilion G42-200 of 8GB of RAM which is much much better than the 4GB of RAM that comes standard on this notebook computer from HP</p>

<p><strong>HP Pavilion G61-400 series notebook RAM and Memory Upgrades</strong></p>

<p>The HP Pavilion G61-400 series of notebooks comes in many different configurations so depending on your exact model number you may be able to expand your HP Pavilion G61 400 series RAM to either 4GB or 8gB of Maximum RAM. This HP pavilion ships with 3gb of RAM standard so I suggest replacing the smaller 1GB ram chip in one memory upgrade slot and buying a 2gb ram module for the HP Pavilion G61-400 notebook series. If you have model that can accept 8GB of RAM then pull the 3gb out of there and install two 4gb ram modules to max out this particular HP Pavilion G61-400 series.</p>

<p>**<br />
<strong>**HP Pavilion G61-600 series notebook RAM and Memory Upgrades</strong></p>

<p>The HP Pavilion G61-600 series ships standard with  3gb of DDR2 SDRAM RAM but you can upgrade to 4GB of RAM by replacing the 1GB RAM module with a 2gb ddr2 sdram sodimm for the HP Pavilion G61-600</p>

<p><strong>HP Pavilion G62-600 series notebook RAM and Memory Upgrades</strong></p>

<p>The HP Pavilion G62-600 series notebook RAM and Memory Upgrades ships standard with 4gb of DDR3 sdram sodimms in the two memory upgrade slots so you can put 2 x 4gb ddr3 sdram sodimms and max out the  HP Pavilion G62-600 series RAM to the maximum 8GB of RAM allowed for this high performance  HP Pavilion model.</p>

<p><strong>HP Pavilion G62-200 series laptop memory and Ram Upgrades</strong></p>

<p>The HP Pavilion G62-200 ships standard with either 3gb or 4gb of RAM  depending on the model and is broken down to the following when considering standard ram configurations:</p>

<p>The G62-220US: 3 GB DDR2 (1 x 1024 MB + 1 x 2048 MB)<br />
G62-208CA / G62-221CA / G62-220CA / G62-224CA / G62-219CA: 3 GB DDR3 (1 x 1024 MB + 1 x 2048 MB)</p>

<p>G62-237CA / G62-238CA: 4 GB DDR2 (2 x 2048 MB)<br />
G62-228CA / G62-264CA / G62-244CA / G62-223CA / G62-227CA: 4 GB DDR3 (2 x 2048 MB)</p>

<p>As you can see there’s two different types of RAM here with the lower end G62-200 models using the slower ddr2 sdram at either 3gb or 4gb of RAM standard but the higher end models use the DDR3 sdram sodimms. The good news is all these models regardless can accept 8GB of RAM as maximum memory, so it’s a good idea to upgrade to the max of 8gb using 2x4gb ram , either ddr2 or dd3 depending on your specific HP Pavilion notebook model.</p>

<p><strong>HP Pavilion G72-200 notebook PC series RAM and Memory Upgrades</strong></p>

<p>The HP Pavilion G72-200 notebook series is another model that uses both DDR2 or DDR3 SDRAM sodimms depending on the specific HP Pavilion G72 series you have. Standard memory for these HP Pavilion Notebooks is as follows:</p>

<p>G72-214CA / G72-217CA: 4 GB DDR2 (2 x 2048 MB)<br />
G72-260US: 4 GB DDR3 (2 x 2048 MB)</p>

<p>And this HP notebook too offers a maximum memory allowance of 8GB across the board. just be sure to buy the right memory for your specific Pavilion model and then upgrade by buying either 2x4gb DDR2 or DDR3 memory modules.</p>

<p><strong>HP Envy 13-100 Notebook Series RAM and Memory Upgrades</strong></p>

<p>The HP Envy 13 series from HP can be maxed out at 5gb of RAM and this is accomplished by supplementing the 1gb of ram that’s non removeable and on board and adding 1x4gb DDR3 sdram sodimms replacing the standard 2GB memory module.</p>

<p><strong>HP Envy 14-1000 Notebook series RAM and Memory Upgrades</strong></p>

<p>The HP Envy 14 series from HP ships standard with 4GB of RAM and can be maxed out to 2gb of RAM by installing 2x4gb DDR3 sdram sodimms to get a maximum of 8GB of RAM for your new HP Envy 14 series. I suggest you add the maximum HP envy RAM to get  the most out of your HP notebook computer</p>

<p><strong>HP Envy 15-1000 notebook series RAM and Memory Upgrades</strong></p>

<p>The HP Envy 15 series notebooks already ship with a healthy  6GB of RAM but you can ADD 16gb of RAM to this HP notebook and it’s one of the few notebooks that will accept and recognize 16gb of RAM, so I suggest you max out your HP Envy 15 by adding 4x4gb ddr3 sdram pc3-8500 sodimm for blazing fast notebook experience.</p>

<p>**HP Envy 17 -1000 notebook series RAM and Memory Upgrades **</p>

<p>The HP Envy 17 series notebooks can accept up to 8GB of ram by replacing the factory ram and adding 2x4gb ddr3 sdram sodimms to get  to the maximum memory for the HP Envy 17.</p>

<p><strong>HP HDX series notebook RAM and Memory Upgrades</strong></p>

<p>The HP and HDX series notebooks come in a few different configurations and the HDX16t model offers a max of 8gb ram allowable by upgrading the two memory slots to 2x4gb of ddr2 pc2 6400 DDR sodimms. The HDX 18t will also accept 8gb of RAM as the maximum memory configuration but depending on what 18t model you have you might need ddr2 or ddr3 pc sdram sodimms. Regardless its the same for each: replace the stock ram and replace it with 2x4gb ram memory modules.</p>

<p><strong>HP Pavilion dv6-1200 entertainment notebook PC series RAM and Memory Upgrades</strong></p>

<p>The HP Pavilion dv6-1200 supports up to 8gb of RAM and requires ddr2 pc2 6400 sdram sodimms and the maximum ram of 8gb is achieved by installing 2x4gb into the 2 memory upgrade slots available in this specific notebook computer by HP.</p>

<p><strong>HP Pavilion dm1-2000 entertainment notebook PC series  RAM and Memory Upgrades</strong></p>

<p>The HP Pavilion DM1-2000 entertainment notebook PC series RAM and Memory uprades are maxed out at 5gb of RAM which means to get there, you have to replace the factory ram or memory in the one available slot and install and buy a 4gb ddr3 1066 sdram sodimm dimm which will get you to the 5gb max ram for the dm1-2000 from HP</p>

<p>**HP Pavilion DM3-1000 enterntainment notebook PC memory RAM and memory upgrades **</p>

<p>The HP Pavilion DM3-1000 entertainment notebook PC series may or may not be able to upgrade your ram depending on which specific model you have: the DM3-1040US is the only  one that will accept more ram upgrades and it will accept 8gb of RAM by upgrading to 2x4gb ddr3 sdram sodimms.</p>

<p>**HP Pavilion DM3-1100 entertainment notebook PC memory and RAM Upgrades **</p>

<p>What ram you need for the DM3-1100 entertainment notebooks depends on what you’ve got: The dm3-1100us takes DDR2 memory upgrade sodimms but the dm3-1100ca uses the newer ddr3 sdram sodimms and the ddr3 model is the only model you can buy more memory for: you can install 8gb of RAM into the ddr3 version of the DM3-1100 but you can’t put any more ram into the DM3-1100 that uses DDR2 ram as it comes from HP with maximum of 4gb of RAM already installed.</p>

<p>**HP Pavilion DM4-1000 notebook PC series RAM and Memory Upgrades **</p>

<p>The HP Pavilion DM4-1000 laptop series ships standard with 4gb of RAM already installed and uses DDR3 sdram sodimms that you’ll have to pull and  install the 2×2 DDR3 sdram sodimms  and install 4gb ddr sdram sodimms in the two memory upgrade slots HP provides.</p>

<p><strong>HP Pavilion DV4-1500 entertainment notebook PC series RAM and Memory Upgrades</strong></p>

<p>The HP Pavilion DV4-1500 series notebooks from HP come standard from the factory with 4gb of ddr3 sdram installed but you can max out this enterntainment PC to 8gb of ram by upgrading the ram to two 4gb sdram ddr3 sodimms and I suggest you do. It’s easy to upgrade the RAM in your dv4-1500 and you can install the ram yourself.</p>

<p>**HP Pavilion DV4-2100 entertainment notebook PC series RAM and Memory Upgrades **</p>

<p>The HP Pavilion DV4-2100 series uses either ddr2 sdram memory or ddr3 sdram memory depending on what specific model of this series of notebook memory you require.

<p><strong>HP Pavilion dv6-1300 entertainment notebook PC series RAM and Memory Upgrades</strong></p>

<p>The HP Pavilion DV6-1300 entertainment notebook PC series comes in 3 different models: dv6-1360us, dv6-1330ca and dv6-1350us and they all ship standard with 4gb of DDR3 sdram memory and and all three dvd-1300 series models can be maxed out to 8gb of RAM by replacing the 2x2gb ram modules with larger 4x4gb ddr3 sdram sodimms.</p>

dv6-2140ca / dv6-2164ca / dv6-2128ca: Supports up to 8 GB DDR2 memory<br />
dv6-2130ca / dv6-2150ca / dv6-2138ca: Supports up to 8 GB DDR3 memory</p>

<p>Like most other series, you either need DDR3 SDRAM sodimms or DDR2 sodimms depending on your HP model number but the good news is all model in the DV6-2100 series can max out at 8gb of RAM by installding 2x4gb ram modules in the two memory upgrade slots allowed.</p>

<p><strong>HP Pavilion DV6-3000 serieas enterntainment notebook PC RAM and Memory Upgrades</strong></p>

<p>The HP Paviloon DV6-3000 series of notebook computers is another system that offers a lot of different options and specific part numbers and it’s easy to get overwhelmed when buying ram but I’m hoping I can help you get the right ram for your HP Pavilion,whatever the model number.</p>

<p>Standard memory upgrades for this model is as follows:</p>

dv7-4057ca / dv7-4054ca / dv7-4090ca: 6 GB DDR3 (1 x 2048 MB + 1 x 4096 MB)<br />
dv7-4074ca / dv7-4078ca: 8 GB DDR3 (2 x 4096 MB)</p>

<p>but the good news is you can upgrade your DV7-3100 notebook to a maximum 8GB of RAM but you will have to determine whether you will need 2x4gb RAM upgrades or just 1x4gb RAM to replace either one or both factory installed memory modules.</p>

<p>Wow, that’s quite a title but I just wanted to make a note that I’ve added Memory To Go RAM  to my <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/iMac_(DDR3_1333)/" title="imac ram upgrades">iMac Memory Upgrades</a> and<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/iMac_KITS_(DDR3_1333)/" title="imac memory upgrade kits"> iMac Memory Upgrade Kits</a></strong> for the new(er) i3, i5 and i7 21 inch iMacs and also 27 inch iMacs too.</p>

<p>Memory To Go offers the memory for the new Apple iMacs in both module and kit sizes so you’ll have to check both pages to get the best deal on RAM from Memory To Go for the new iMacs. I’m not going to list exact prices here as the prices will and do change  but you can always check the links I have above for current ram prices for the new Apple iMacs.</p>

<p>At the time I write this, Memory To Go has memory prices in 2gb modules for new Apple iMacs, 4GB modules for Apple iMac and 4GB ram upgrade kits for 4GB and 8GB. Oddly, there’s no 16gb kit listed even though the new Apple iMacs can accept and use up to 16GB of RAM easily. You could order 2x8gb kits or you could order or buy 4x4gb memory for iMacs too to get to the 16gb maximum ram allowed for the new Apple i3, i5 and i7 iMac models.</p>

<p>Again you can check out the <strong>ram prices for new 1333Mhz Apple iMacs</strong> at the top of the page.</p>

		<div class="post-content"><p>MacBook RAM used to be expensive. Almost as much as the computer the ram was intended for if you can believe it.

<p><strong>Different MacBook Memory Types</strong></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;">There’s essentially two different types of RAM for Macbook that could fit in your computer. If you have a new and  current MacBook, congrats as you have a very nice and cheap apple macbook and  it only makes sense to fill that sucker with RAM. As much memory as you can fit in, which at the time I write this is 4GB of RAM. To get an Apple computer or Apple Notebook that takes 8GB of memory you will need to get a MacBook Pro but today we’re all about the MacBooks which in my opinion offer the best bang for your shopping dollar. </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;">Where was I? Right, the newest MacBooks and anything from about 2008 and up take DDR3 1066 SDRAM dimms which are cheap cheap cheap right now and you buy enough ram to fill your macbook for under $100. Even a year ago this would have cost you much much more than that – closer to $500 for MacBook RAM. </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;">If you’ve got one of the first intel based MacBooks you probably need DDR2 PC5300 SDRAM and it’s pretty cheap too, in fact cheaper as these older Macbooks which came in both black and white configurations only could accept 2GB maximum, which is fine for web browsing or email or even some light photoshop or iMovie stuff too. Technically and according to Apple you can get 2GB max into these Macbook models but some of the later models would recognize 3gB of RAM which would require you to install a 2GB RAM for MacBook and a 1GB RAM for MacBook in the two slots.  This isn’t recommended by Apple, so I’m not going to suggest it either. You might be better off  just buying a new MacBook with a faster processor  if you need to use more than 2gb of RAM, or maybe even pick up the 13 inch MacBook Pro which will allow you even more RAM at 8GB </span></p>

    <h1><a href="/2010/08/highest-ram-prices/">Highest RAM Prices</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>I know when usually shopping for memory or RAM it’s natural to want to shop for the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="lowest price on ram">lowest price you can possibly find on memory upgrades</a> but it’s fun (to me anyway) to look at how much people will pay for memory and RAM.</p>

<p>Take <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/Mac_Pro_RAM_Upgrade_Kits_DDR3_1333_with_8GB_RAM-64gb/" title="mac pro 64gb ram">64GB for the Apple Mac Pros</a> for example. That’s a whole lot of ram for just one computer and you will pay for the the chance to fill your Mac Pro from Apple with RAM. You’ll pay dearly too. Almost $3000 for ram upgrades  and I think it’s the highest ram price I have ever listed here on ramseeker.</p>

<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-420" title="scientist" alt="" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/memorylady2.jpg" width="423" height="284" /></p>

<p>I’ve come close a few times and when those new iMacs were released a few years back the news sites  and the mac web in general were all a twitter about how much ram costs.  At the time to upgrade your iMac would cost you about $1000 which considering the iMac computer itself isn’t that much more money, it’s a lot to spend  on ram and  definitely the most money you could spend in the history of the Apple  iMac on Memory Upgrades.</p>

<p>But as I’ve seen over and over and over again – If you can wait  to upgrade your memory than maybe it’s not a bad idea. For some models, it’s probably best to just max out your ram now while you can. For <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_Pro_KITS_(1066_DDR3)/" title="macbook pro memory">MacBook Pro memory</a> and almost any PC notebook too that takes the DDR3 1066 ram you can fill the computer chock full of memory for under $250 and I suggest you do.</p>

<p>But a  good rule of thumb to follow is that if your ram upgrade costs $1000 or more, figure out if the cost of the ram upgrade can actually pay for itself. It’s one thing to drop $100 on ram so that facebook loads  a bit faster in your browser, but another when you have to spend  $1000 or more for memory for the same task.</p>

<p>But, if you’re making money with your comptuter it might be the best money you ever spent on ram upgrades if you will become  more efficient in your work due to the increase of ram in your computer. Even a three thousand dollar ram upgrade works out to $250 a month, which considered to other expenses for your business might be the biggest bargain ever – even if your ram upgrade is one of the highest ram prices currently available.</p>

<div style="float: right; margin-right: 5px;">
</div>

<div style="float: right; margin-right: 5px;">
</div>

<p>I was asked this question today:</p>

<p><em>Jim, I am buying a MacBook Pro, should I get the 8GB ram upgrade and who should I buy the ram from? Should I Buy the RAM from the Apple Store?</em></p>

<p><em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1149" title="Cheapest MacBook Pro" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-24-at-7.39.14-AM1.png" alt="Best MacBook Pro Price" width="283" height="223" /></a></em></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I">Best Place To Buy a MacBook Pro</a></strong></p>

<p>There’s a few questions to answer there so let’s break this down into parts shall we?</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Congrats on the MacBook Pro.  It’s a powerful computer that will work for you for some time depending on your needs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yes, I suggest maxing out the MacBook Pro with as much RAM as you can and for the MBP’s that’s 8GB of RAM and you get there by either buying an 8GB RAM Kit for the MacBook Pro or you buy 2x4GB RAM Upgrades individually, but you will need two of them.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>And here’s why I think that you should <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="max out the ram macbook pro">max out the ram on the  MacBook Pro:</a> It’s a professional computer and you’re going to drop at least $1500 to buy the professional laptop computer but you’re on the fence about memory upgrades, which cost a fraction of what you spent on the  Apple notebook itself but will offer probably the best value for your computing dollar. As I write this, <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_Pro_KITS_(1066_DDR3)-8gb/" title="8GB for MacBook Pro">8GB for MacBook Pro</a> will set you back about $250 for you to max out your ram and get some work done that will pay the bills. I guess it’s the economy but you’ve just spent a good chunk of change on a notebook but you won’t upgrade the RAM?</p>

<ol>
  <li>Which brings us to the next question – where should you buy your MacBook Pro? The Apple Store is good but you’ll pay full load for it there. When pick up a<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26x%3D0%26ref_%3Dnb_sb_noss%26fsc%3D6%26ih%3D8_0_0_0_0_1_1_0_0_1.3_102%26y%3D0%26field-keywords%3Dmacbook%2520pro%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957" title="macbook pro deal"> MacBook Pro from Amazon </a>you can save a few percentage points and use the savings to buy more RAM. If you do buy your MacBook Pro from Apple, you might be able to save some money as you can order the MBP filled with RAM as a custom configuration but I’m warning you: Apple RAM is not the cheapest RAM you can buy. But do the math as you might be better off getting the RAM and Computer from the same store to save you money.  Take the ten minutes or so to shop around and get the best price on a MacBook Pro with 8GB of RAM, regardless of where you buy.</li>
</ol>

<p>What is the <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="best macbook pro memory">Best MacBook Pro Memory</a></strong>?</p>

<p>This is just another question I get asked a whole lot and yet I’m reluctant to suggest any one particular store because then I would of course be showing a bias towards one computer memory reseller and  I don’t want to do that.</p>

<p>[table id=1 /]</p>

<p>But what I can tell those that are in the market for MacBook Pro Memory that any and all memory stores on ramseeker will gaurantee your memory upgrades so you can be sure that you’re not buying memory from a shady memory reseller and believe me, they’re out there.</p>

<p>[table id=15 /]</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I"><img title="Cheapest MacBook Pro" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-24-at-7.39.14-AM1.png" alt="Best MacBook Pro Price" width="283" height="223" /></a></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I">Best MacBook Pro Prices</a></strong></p>

<p>So what to look for when shopping for best MacBook Pro memory? Customer service is on the top of my list and I also dont’ mind paying a bit more for name brand too. But that’s my opinion only but if I have a choice between generic ram and name brand, I will chose the name brand ram every time even though you can buy generic ram cheaper.</p>

<p>There’s nothing wrong with generic ram and it is cheaper -whether for MacBook Pro or any other computer, the generic stuff is still tested and guaranteed to work from each and every store I list that sells <strong>MacBook Pro Memory</strong>. You can’t <strong>buy generic RAM</strong> from these stores and go wrong and that’s the reason I list the memory store’s prices.</p>

<p>I have never allowed any sneaky or shady prices on ramseeker to be posted, which unlike some other sites the price comparisons do match what is on the memory store’s site and it’s the price on ram you can expect to pay. No bait and switch or other questionable tactics are allowed.</p>

<p>I will tell you that I do  list and track MacBook Pro ram prices that are the lowest price as that’s why you’re here  – to compare prices on memory upgrades from reputable memory stores, and I hope you’re happy with my efforts. But to do so this usually means that to be competitive I’m tracking MacBook Pro generic RAM to get the best ram prices for you.</p>

<p>Sometimes I can do better and get you discounts on ram upgrades that are exclusive to ramseeker and you can’t find a better deal on MacBook Pro RAM from any other website. I  work hard to get you the best MacBook Pro RAM Prices  and that’s just one of the many Apple RAM upgrades I track. The special deals are already listed for you too. You do not need any memory upgrade coupon code. I have tried to offer you that in the past and it wasn’t worth the effort. It’s much easier and better for all parties to have a special ‘ramseeker price’ for RAM and list that price as the best price on RAM at the time.</p>

<p>If you are looking for the best price on Macbook Pro RAM you’re at at the right place.</p>

<p>Let me know if you need any help with your ram upgrades.</p>

<p>Do you need help with **buying memory **for your new or old computer? I’m happy to offer ram shopping help and you can always email me at jim at ramseeker.com. I don’t sell memory but I do and can recommend the right and correct memory upgrades for your computer regardless of what make it is or notebook or desktop computer.</p>

<p>Most memory stores do offer a memory configurator which is usually a pull down menu or some times it’s a list of links to popular or new memory upgrades that are popular for  most of the newer and modern computers as these are the most computers that can benefit from a ram upgrade.</p>

<p>The memory configurators are a good way to find out what RAM or Memory your computer needs but it gets confusing  as to what Memory you need. If you’re just an average computer user you don’t care about MHz or GHz or bus speeds or all the other technical  mumbo jumbo. All you want to do is to speed up your computer by using more ram and it will</p>

<p>Adding more ram is like moving into a bigger house. Instead of there being no room for your computer to work with, when you add ram it’s like now your computer has enough space to get things done and keep all the data organized and labeled and ready to use at a moment’s notice which is what ram does. stores stuff that the computer is going to need soon. It’s the technical equivalent of  “here hold this for a second”.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001KB6Z2U/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001KB6Z2U"><img title="Best RAM Prices" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-3.00.24-PM.png" alt="Cheapest RAM Prices" width="309" height="308" /></a></p>

<p>And there’s no reason why you shouldn’t upgrade your computer memory these days as ram is cheap and spending $100 on RAM is much better bang for buck for your computing dollar than say, spending it on a software update just because there’s a new version out, when the old software you have works just fine. (Windows Vista, anyone?)</p>

<p>But with RAM, unless you’re buying very large and very new technology – is pretty cheap. $100 for most notebooks gets you 4GB of memory which is what I recommend at a bare minimum for computing in 2010.</p>

<p>Again, I don’t sell RAM. I just like to shop for RAM and help you get the best price from a fair and reputable memory store on your memory upgrades, that’s it.</p>

<p>If you do need help when <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="shopping for ram">shopping for ram </a>or memory don’t hestitate to contact me if you can’t figure out what type or size of RAM your computer needs. I’m here to help you.</p>

<p>Now that it’s 2012,  it’s pretty easy to say that the minimum memory for today’s Apple Macintosh computers when it comes to <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="mac memory">Mac Memory</a> is 4GB of RAM. I could be wrong but I know the new MacBooks ship with 2gb of RAM standard and I’m pretty sure that the Mac Mini’s do too and the MacBook Pros start at 4gb of RAM and the Mac Pros can be filled with 64gb of ram if you’ve got deep enough pockets.</p>

<p>All this to say if you’re shopping for a memory upgrade for a new MacBook or Macbook Pro or, yes even Mac Mini – that you should have your sights on at very least 4GB of RAM for these Macs.</p>

<p>But with it being back to school season, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26x%3D0%26ref_%3Dnb_sb_noss%26fsc%3D4%26ih%3D4_1_1_1_0_0_1_0_0_2.7_96%26y%3D0%26field-keywords%3Dmacbook%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957" title="buying a macbook">buying a MacBook</a> is going to be a popular activity over the next month or thereabouts so I want to talk about MacBook Memory as this is probably the  one computer form Apple that could really benefit from a 4gb Mac Memory Upgrade.</p>

<p>At 2gb stanard, Apple had to cut corners somewhere to get the MacBook to the Magical $999 price so they tossed 2x1Gb chips in it and said good enough..  (which I think is still a lot for what it is, but that’s a topic for another day). 4gb for MacBook  will turn your MB into a much more useable machine and 4gb is no money these days and the result of hte macbook ram upgrade will be making it more capable and it doesn’t matter what you’re doing with it surfing, email and so on will run faster and smoother with more memory for your portable mac.</p>

<p>If you’re running a Mac with 2GB or less and it’s a newer modern machine you should stop what you’re doing right now and see if you can get 4gb of RAM into your Mac somehow.</p>

<p>If you can’t add 4GB of RAM you might be better off buying a new Mac that allows 4gb.</p>

<p>4GB of RAM for all Macs released in 2010 should be the minimum amount in my opinion.</p>

<p>Installing Memory in a MacBook Pro (or macbook) is pretty easy and can be don by the average computer user without any special tools or know-how.</p>

<p>First, you need to buy new macbook pro RAM  to install (see current prices on MacBook Pro Memory above) and replace the standard MacBook Pro memory that came installed with your computer in the first place. **Add as much macbook pro ram as you can afford. **You can never never go wrong when shopping for macbook pro ram when you buy ram from my list of authorized <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="macbook pro stores">macbook pro stores</a>. Brand can matter for some people when it comes to shopping for MacBook Pro RAM as there’s a small chance that the brand name stuff will work a bit better  in your MacBook Pro as usually it’s been tested and guaranteed to work. Generic MacBook Pro RAM works just fine too but you might be buying a wee bit more peace of mind when you buy the name brand ram. The cheapest RAM may or may not be the the best price on MacBook Pro RAM.</p>

<p>[table id=1 /]</p>

<p>Once you have the RAM in your hand, you might want to invest in an anti-static wrist band. Sometimes you can buy the anti-static wrist band at the same time as you buy the MacBook Pro RAM, but  sometimes you’ll have to go elsewhere to buy an antistatic wrist band for installing memory. Your local computer store can usually help you.</p>

<p>You don’t NEED an antistatic wrist band if you’re sure to discharge any static electricity you have on you by touching  the metal casing of  your macbook pro first to discharge any static before you install the macbook pro ram. Also, it’s probably not a good idea to wear wool sweaters on a dry winter day or rub balloons on your head just before you install the macbook pro memory.  Be sure to discharge any static electricity before you go about installing RAM yourself. RAM is very particular and can be damaged by static electricity. When you bought it, you should have received it in an anti-static bag and sometimes there’s a big warning sticker on the bag that you have to break before you can access the ram and it says the same thing I’ve been saying: <strong>static electricity is bad for ram</strong></p>

<p>Once you’re all set to go then all you do is  remove the battery of your macbook pro, take  of the bottom part, or sometimes even then entire bottom. You might need a very small philips screwdriver or sometimes a specific torx screwdriver to do this. On my MacBook Pro, to add more ram once I had the cover off, I had to unplug and remove the MacBook Pro hard drive before I could access the RAM slots.</p>

<p>Once there, there’s two slots for MacBook Pro RAM and to remove the old MacBook Pro memory there’s two tabs that hold down the ram and when I did this the memory popped up to a 45 degree angle  which allowed me take hold of the memory (watch that static!) and with a slight pull I removed the memory. I did the same thing when removing the ram from the second memory slot and in no time I was ready to install my new MacBook Pro RAM.</p>

<p>For the actual installation of memory on my MacBook Pro all I did was the reverse. You slip the memory in at about a 45 degree angle into the slots and seat the memory into the slot. It’s a tight fit sometimes so don’t be afraid to use some gentle pressure. Push down on the RAM once it’s seated and the two little tabs click in to lock the memory down into the macbook pro’s memory slots. Repeat for the second memory slot in the MacBook Pro and you can’t go wrong really. The RAM has a little notch in it so you can’t install the memory backwards or upside down. The RAM only fits into the slot one way.</p>

<p>When you have your MacBook Pro ram installed,  all you do is replace what you removed to get at the memory upgrades slots. replace the hard drive, screw the cover or bottom of the MacBook Pro back on and replace the MacBook Pro Battery.  Press the power button and your MacBook Pro should start up without any trouble and now the MacBook Pro will run faster too and allow you to get your work done quicker.</p>

<p>Apple has excellent instructions on <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="how to install macbook pro ram">how to install MacBook Pro RAM </a> and you can find them by <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1270" title="install macbook pro ram">clicking here</a>. They’ve got instructions for a whole range of MacBook Pros so I suggest you refer to their instructions before installing MacBook Pro memory on your own.</p>

<p><strong>Where to Buy 8GB of RAM</strong></p>

<p>If you’re shopping online for 8GB of RAM there are loads of memory shops, stores,vendors whatever you wan to call them that will be more than happy to sell you 8GB of RAM.</p>

<p>But you should do your homework first. You might think it’s the best idea to shop for the lowest priced RAM but sometimes, not always – this is not the best way to buy ram as yes, price is king for RAM or anything else but memory is pretty advanced stuff. It’s not like  you’re buying a cup of coffee here. You’re buying what was once thought of impossible:8GB of memory for a very competitive price regardless of you who you end up buying RAM from and it wouldn’t hurt you to do some smart shopping and buy RAM from someobody who knows the business and what RAM you need for your computer.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW"><img title="Best Price 8GB MacBook Pro" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-3.09.11-PM.png" alt="Cheapest MacBook Pro 8GB" width="309" height="214" /></a></strong></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW">8GB MacBook Pro RAM</a></strong></p>

<p> </p>

<p>There are thousands and thousands of different computer models out there and each and every one  of them could benefit from a memory upgrade but some won’t even accept the 8GB  memory so that’s the first thing you need to know: How much RAM can your computer handle?</p>

<p>Next, will your OS recognize  the RAM. If you’re running an older version of windows or even the latest windows 7 be sure to check and be sure you can use and benefit from an 8GB RAM upgrade as you’re just throwing your money away if your computer won’t acknowledge the memory upgrade in the first place.</p>

<p>Once you’ve got those two things solved, you need to decide on  what’s important to you when shopping for RAM. Are you on a budget and the only way  you can  upgrade your memory is if you buy the cheapest RAM, or do you have a few more dollars to spend on brand name ram vs generic ram. Brand name RAM might be no better than generic, but for some it’s important to know that their memory came from a specific supplier as opposed to some that are nothing more than ram resellers.</p>

<p>How about customer service?  If you’re a programmer or IT specialist or even just an advanced hobbyist than you probably know your way around a memory upgrade and you probably have a favorite place to buy ram already and don’t care about customer service.</p>

<p>But if you’re new to computers and wouldn’t mind a bit of help with the memory upgrades both in the pre-sale and after sale  support you might be better off buying your 8GB RAM from somebody who offers the support you need.</p>

<p>Now that we have all our options and preferences when it comes to buying ram online (or even in store) we can go shopping for 8GB RAM. I suggest you buy 8GB of RAM from the following memory vendors:</p>

<p>Crucial Technology</p>

<p>18004Memory</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memoryx">Memory X </a></p>

<p>OEMPCWORLD</p>

<p>RAMJET</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memorytogo">Memory To Go </a></p>

<p>Other World Computing</p>

<p>These memory suppliers, or stores have been in business for over ten years, some closer to twenty and all will support you both in offering the best price on 8GB of RAM regardless of whether you are shopping for ram for Apple, Dell, HP or Sony Computers to name a few, the above listed memory sellers will help you get the right 8GB ram for the best price.</p>

<p>Good luck shopping for<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="8GB RAM Memory"> 8GB of RAM Memory</a></p>

<p>Unfortunately you cannot upgrade a MacBook to 8GB of RAM or Memory. <strong>Yet</strong>.</p>

<p>To get 8GB into an Apple notebook you’ll need to be working with a MacBook Pro as one of the advantages is that the MacBook Pro models can accept and recognize more  RAM than the lesser MacBooks and that’s just one of the few differnces when you compare the two macbook lines from Apple</p>

<p>The good news (and we’re talking about 2010 MacBook and MacBook Pros here is that you can  upgrade your MacBook to 4GB – and for the market the MacBook is aimed at (ie: consumer and educational market) 4GB of RAM is more than enough RAM for your MacBook. If you need 8GB of RAM than consider the MacBook Pro 13 inch if you want to fill a MacBook with 8GB of RAM.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW"><img title="Best Price 8GB MacBook Pro" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-3.09.11-PM.png" alt="Cheapest MacBook Pro 8GB" width="309" height="214" /></a></p>

<p>But forget about 8GB for MacBook Pros for  a second as we’re going to assume you have a MacBook or are considering buying a MacBook and regardless: you need more RAM for your MacBook.</p>

<p>The good news is 4GB MacBook RAM is much cheaper than 8GB of MacBook Pro RAM anyway so do yourself a favor and upgrade your MacBook and sell the original RAM that came with your MacBook back  to the memory stores. I know that OEMPCWORLD and RAMJET are just two memory stores that will buy your memory back from you. This is one way to offset the cost of your MacBook RAM upgrade even more as now you can upgrade your MacBook for even less. Currently a 4GB memory upgrade kit for MacBook  is priced under $100 whereas 8GB for MacBook Pros run a little under $300 still. If you managed to sell your old MacBook Memory you’re well under $100 for a MacBook that’s maxed out with memory. Don’t go out one night, eat at home instead  (I like pizza) and you’ll have saved enough money to upgrade your MacBook to the maximum 4GB of RAM.</p>

<p>If you have an older MacBook you can still get at very least 2GB of ram into your older MacBook for example a black macbook from circa 2006 or so is still a very useable and viable computer and and upgrade to 2gb costs about the same as a night at the movies so it’s my opinion it would be silly not to upgrade your macbook, regardless of when you bought it or what year it is.</p>

<p>For MacBook RAM prices I list  <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_KITS_(1066_DDR3)-4gb/" title="macbook 4gb memory kits">4gb macbook  upgrade kits</a> for newer models of MacBooks and if you have an older version of the Macbook you’re best off to upgrade with <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_(PC5300_DDR_KITS)-2gb/" title="macbook 2gb pc5300 memory upgrade kits">2GB MacBook PC5300 DDR memory upgrade kits.</a></p>

<p>I thought I’d take a minute or so and go over some MacBook Pro Memory upgrade options as Apple has this habit of calling every Pro MacBook they’ve released over the years MacBook Pro. Matte Screen, Glossy Screen, Santa Rosa, i3, i5, i7, Intel Core 2 Processors the list goes on and on.</p>

<p>If you’re buying a new MacBook Pro 13 inch, 15 inch, or 17 inch doesn’t matter. They all take the same RAM or Memory and that’s 1066 DDR3 sodimms. You can buy the ram from the Apple store (if you’ve got money to burn) or you can buy it from reputable third party vendors that you can trust such as: RAMJET, OWC, 18004Memory, MemoryX, OEMPCWORLD and Memory To Go. All these online memory stores know all about MacBook Pros  and what RAM goes where.</p>

<p>I’ve made a handy dandy little list of <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_Pro_(1066_DDR3)/" title="macbook pro 1066 ddr3">MacBook Pro DDR3 1066 RAM Prices</a> and also, <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_Pro_KITS_(1066_DDR3)/" title="macbook pro memory upgrade kits">MacBook Pro DDR3 1066 Memory Upgrade Kits</a>. I suggest you check out both pages to get the<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="best ram deal"> best deal on ram</a> for a new (or new-ish) MacBook Pro.</p>

<p>For the older MacBook Pros you’ll need <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_Pro_(PC5300_DDR)/" title="macbook pro pc5300 ddr">PC5300 DDR2 SDRAM sodimms</a>. This sounds like a mouthful of  technical jargon and it is but if you’ve got an older MacBook Pro  (older than  two years old) than there’s a good chance you need the PC5300 DDR MacBook Pro RAM as opposed to the newer 1066MHz  MacBook Pro RAM.</p>

<p>And, again I happen to have a handy list of all the memory stores you can buy MacBook Pro RAM from for both <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_Pro_(PC5300_DDR_KITS)/" title="macbook pro pc5300 ddr memory upgrade kits">MacBook Pro PC5300 DDR memory upgrade kits </a>and MacBook  Pro PC5300 DDR modules priced individually.</p>

<p>Why the difference between the modules and the memory upgrade kits? Because over time I have found some stores list all their memory upgrades as memory modules yet others chose to market their ram upgrades as kits. You need to upgrade MacBook Pro RAM 2 at a time anyway (or at least, it’s recommended to do so) so it makes sense to sell the MacBook Pro RAM in matched pairs.</p>

<p>If you have no idea what RAM for the MacBook Pro you should be shopping for one quick and easy way is  to go to the Apple Menu in the top left corner of your screen (we’re assuming you’re on your macbook now) and select about your Mac. You’ll get information about your processor and memory at the same time and from there it’s easy to see as Apple tells you what ram speed you’re running and what type – exactly what you need to figure out what RAM is best for your specific MacBook Pro model.</p>

<p>Here’s my MacBook info as an example:</p>

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>[table id=2 /]</p>

<p>I have been monitoring memory prices for iMac since the very beginning with the very first  iMac ever released and I have come to realize that this very popular computer continues to offer the best bang for your dollar when shopping for an Apple desktop computer. And the value increases tremondously if you add more RAM to your Apple iMac – especially if you choose to maximize the amount of Memory installed in  your computer.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8IO6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8IO6"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1309" title="iMac RAM Memory" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-3.14.09-PM.png" alt="Cheap iMac Deals" width="297" height="267" /></a></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8IO6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8IO6">Cheapest Apple iMacs</a></strong></p>

<p>When deciding on the best memory upgrade size to install in new computers, or iMacs rather,  our friends at Apple are most concerned with installing the bare minimum of RAM so that the Mac OS will load on the iMac and maybe an application will run – something like Apple’s Mail program or Safari the Apple web browser.</p>

<p>But what if  you want  to get the most performance out of your iMac? You add more memory. Memory for the Apple iMacs have dropped in price considerably especially for the larger 8gb and now 16GB memory upgrade kits. When the 4GB DDR3 1066Mhz memory for Apple iMacs first came on the scene you’d be digging deep deep deep into your pockets and you’d not be suprised to pay almost what the Apple iMac costs but just in adding new RAM or Memory. 4GB RAM was priced at almost $500 per memory module.</p>

<p>Thankfully with any new technology ram prices keep on dropping over time and now you can <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="buy 4gb ddr3 memory">buy 4GB DDR3 for much less</a> yet still get the benefit of maximum performance that a maxed out iMac can provide you.</p>

<p>And now with the newer and latest iMacs you can even expand the RAM to a whopping 16GB on the new and current Apple iMacs with intel i3, i5 and i7 processors. Just a few memory stores supply ram for the 2010 Apple iMacs but over time you can bet more and more will come online and start to supply ram for the 2010 Apple iMacs. So far, I know Crucial Technology, OWC, RAMJET and DMS stock and carry RAM for the new Apple iMacs that require the 1333MHz RAM upgrades.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/iMac_KITS_(DDR3_1333)-16gb/" title="16gb apple iMac 2010">16GB for Apple iMac 2010</a> models is still a little pricey but if you make your living with your Apple iMac the price is not even a consideration really as your time is worth much more than any upgrade memory price and you should be able to recoup the investment in no time with your new iMac working away at maximum capacity.</p>

<p>You will not regret an iMac 2010 memory upgrade, regardless of cost.</p>

<p>If there’s a question I get asked it’s this: <strong>How much memory should I buy?</strong> And my answer always is: <strong>buy as much memory as you can afford</strong>. Obviously for some computer models buying a whole lot of ram is just extremely cost prohibititive – especially for high end desktop models like the new Apple Mac Pro. At the time I write this up, it will almost cost you $3000 to max out  the new <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/Mac_Pro_RAM_Upgrade_Kits_DDR3_1333_with_8GB_RAM/" title="mac pro max out ram">Mac Pro to 64GB of RAM</a>.  I know,  that’s pretty expensive ram upgrades, but this is an exception and not a rule. This is new memory for a new computer model and ram prices historically have dropped over time.</p>

<p>But for consumer systems and especially notebook computer upgrades, my advice is to max out the memory with as much as possible and then forget about it until you’re ready to upgrade to your next computer. For the most part, RAM doesn’t go bad (there’s exceptions) but if you buy memory from reputable companies that sell ram usually you install the memory and you’re done. And you get years of enjoyment out of your computer. You paid top dollar for your computer so it only makes the most sense to get the maximum performance out of it.</p>

<p>Desktop applications might be a bit different as there’s many memory slots (at least 4) for most desktop computers and then you’ll have to do some thought and research. You might still benefit from filling your desktop with ram as it’s one of the easiest ways to get top performance out of your home or office computer. With more and more consumers interested in hobbies such as digital photography and video editing these new breed of computer users could indeed benefit from a RAM upgrade as these are applciations that thrive on lots of memory.</p>

<p>This is just a quide but for 2010 4GB of RAM is the new low ram upgrade and most computers start with a base of at least this amount and sometimes even more. But 4GB is a good start.  If you don’t have 4GB of RAM find out how much ram you currently have and see if you can upgrade to 4GB. If not, you might want to consider a new computer, but I recommend 4GB, but machines that max out at 2GB are still useable too. Most netbooks made ship with just 1GB as standard RAM but for notebook computers look for 2GB or more, but 4GB of RAM is where the sweet spot is in <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="ram upgrades today">ram upgrades today</a></p>

		<div class="post-content"><p>To date, I’ve written a lot about Apple Memory as I’m drinking the Apple kool aid and never could get my mind around the windows thing, although lots have and this is not to fault them. This is not a Mac vs PC rant . Whatever works for you, works.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004K1EQO6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004K1EQO6">Cheapest Dell NoteBook</a></strong></p>

<p>[table id=7 /]</p>

<p>Right, memory. Regardless of what hardware you have such as HP Dell Apple and Sony to name a few computer manufacturers you’ll do yourself a big favor if you upgrade the ram and memory in your computer. RAM allows your OS to breath if you will. Rather than have to access data from your hard drive, which is slower – RAM can be bought and installed in your dell computer which will allow the often needed data to be stored and accessed quickly and when needed.</p>

<p>Let’s help you get the right memory for your Dell Computer, shall we?</p>

<p>**Dell Inspiron Mini 1012 Memory<br />
**<br />
The Dell Inspiron Mini 1012 comes standard from dell with 1GB of RAM but can be expanded to 2GB by replacing the factory installed 1GB PC2-4200 sodimm and replacing it with a bigger 2GB memory upgrade</p>

<p><strong>Dell Inspiron M101z Memory</strong></p>

<p>The Dell Inspiron M101z ships from Dell with 2GB of DDR3 1333MHz RAM but you can and should increase the ram to 8GB of RAM. To do this, replace the 2x1GB memory chips and replace thew with 2x4GB memory upgrades for Dell M101z</p>

<p><strong>Dell Inspiron 15 Memory</strong></p>

<p>The Dell Inspiron 15 (1545) ships from Dell with 1GB of RAM so a 4GB RAM upgrade to the maximum is reccommended for maximum Inspiron 15 performance.</p>

<p><strong>Dell Inspiron 14 Memory</strong></p>

<p>The Dell Inspiron 14 (1440) offers 2GB of RAM standard from the factory and can be upgraded to 4GB of DDR3 1066 sodimms</p>

<p><strong>Dell Inspiron 14R Memory</strong></p>

<p>The Dell Inspiron 14R starts at 2GB of RAM as standard memory configuration and can be upgraded to 8GB of ram using ddr3 1066 SDRAM sodimms. To upgrade to 8GB of RAM you would replace the two 1GB RAM memory modules with larger 4gb RAM for Dell Inspiron 14R.</p>

<p><strong>Dell Inspiron 15R Memory</strong></p>

<p>The Dell Inspiron 15R Laptop starts from the dell factory shipped with 3GB of DDR3 but can be upgraded by installing 4GB x 2 memory upgrades for Dell Inspiron 15R</p>

<p><strong>Dell Inspiron 17R Memory</strong></p>

<p>The Dell Inspiron 17R notebook, or laptop comes from dell with 3GB DDR sdram sodimms installed but you can remove these and install 2x4GB DDR 1066 memory for much greater performance for your new dell. You can install up to 8GB of memory into the Dell Inspiron 17R notebook</p>

<p><strong>Dell Studio 15R Memory</strong></p>

<p>The Dell Studio 15R ships with just 2GB of RAM for operating with, which is too little, I think. You’re much better off upgrading the Studio 15R from dell to the maximum 4GB of RAM by installing 2x2GB PC2-6400 sodimms.</p>

<p><strong>Dell Studio 17 Memory</strong></p>

<p>Dell Studio 17 (1749) is desktop replacement computer for some so it makes the most sense to upgrade the memory on this big screen beauty and it will take up to 8GB of RAM for better performance. Install 2x4GB DDR3 1066 SDRAM sodimms and you’ll never want for more memory again.</p>

<p><strong>Alienware M11x Memory</strong></p>

<p>The Alienware M11x will accept up to 8GB of RAM and you can buy memory for Alienware M11x pretty cheap by adding 2x4GB DDR3 1066MHz for maximum memory performance from your alienware notebook or laptop</p>

<p>**Alienware M15x Memory<br />
**<br />
The Alienware M15x accepts up to 8GB of memory by replacing the 3GB of RAM it ships with and upgrading to a much more useable 8GB of RAM for Alienware M15X by replacing the memory with 4GB DDR3 sodimms</p>

<p><strong>Alienware M17x Memory</strong></p>

<p>The Alienware M17x also runs better with 8GB of RAM when you replace the 4GB that came standard. Install DDR3 1066 4GB x 2 and watch your Alienware run at blazing fast speeds.</p>

<p>And there you have it. <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com">Dell memory upgrades</a> for the most current notebooks, netbooks and laptops currently on sale by Dell.</p>

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p> <br />
Maybe you’re in the market for ram and memory, or maybe you want to buy a dogde ram truck (you have the wrong site if that’s you need). Let’s stick to ram and memory, shall we? It’s tricky to shop for ram . One memory store I came across had five different ways you could shop for ram:<br />
When you have a ram price list in front of you you’ll be able to see at a quick glance what the best ram price for your needs will be.When you’re in the market for memory, whether you’re looking to compare prices on ram upgrades or you just want to buy some ram or memory from a store you can trust you’re usually wanting to refer to one thing and that’s a ram price list of some sort.</p>

<p>shop by ram type</p>

<p>shop by ram brand</p>

<p>shop by computer manufacturer</p>

<p>download software and it will tell you what ram you need.</p>

<p>shop by memory configurator – you use the pull-down menus and select your computer manufacturer, and model name of your computer and the memory configuration tool tells you what ram you need and usually returns a ram price list of all the ram available for your desktop or notebook computer from Apple, Dell, HP and so on..</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW">Cheap RAM</a></strong></p>

<p>The ram memory configurator is the most popular to use when shopping for ram, whether it’s for your PC or Mac. Some memory stores really promote this tool (crucial comes to mind), while other stores prefer you to know what type of RAM you need.</p>

<p>When RAM shopping, if it gets too complicated you can always email me and I’ll do my best to help or I’ve made few price lists for ram over the years that will help you get the best deal on ram upgrades. And by best deal, I don’t mean lowest price.<br />
Some other memory price trackers (even google does this) emphasizes low prices as the best price but with RAM this isn’t the case a lot of the times. Some of the lowest price memory stores I used to track have gone out of business over the years, while the higher priced but still competitive memory stores are still in business after all these years.</p>

<p>These are the memory stores I track and monitor – the memory stores that are reputable and offer a fair price on ram. Every ram store at very least uses the memory configurator as it’s the easiest method to shop for ram. All you have to do is enter your make and model of computer and back comes a specialized <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com">ram price list</a> with the best memory prices available for your specific computer.</p>

		<div class="post-content"><p>What is the best RAM memory price?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1318" title="Best Selling RAM" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-3.30.51-PM.png" alt="Cheap Kingston RAM" width="307" height="184" /></a></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW">Memory Prices Have Dropped in 2010</a></strong></p>

<p>There are a few variables to determine what RAM Memory Price is for you and best suits your needs when it comes to shopping for ram upgrades, or memory upgrades. (For the remainder of this article, RAM and Memory will be used as they have the exact same meaning.</p>

<p>RAM is the best upgrade to your computer that you can do. In fact, I whole heartedly suggest you max out your memory – especially if you are looking to upgrade a netbook or laptop computer as there’s a lot of performance in your portable computer but the manufacturers have this bad habit sometimes of only installing the minimum ram required to start the operating system.</p>

<p>The reasons computer makers like Apple, Dell, HP, Toshiba and others do this is simple: price. Memory is not free (yet) and it costs more money to configure a computer with the maximum memory possible so what they have done to become more price competitive is to transfer the cost to you and allow you to bear the cost.</p>

<p>Oh sure – Apple, Dell and all will be happy to sell you ram for your new notebook (or desktop) but it won’t be the cheapest ram you can buy by any stretch. These are big companies with lots of overhead, employees, distribution networks and other costs that tend to mark up the price of ram to silly amounts by the time it gets to you. Dell, Apple and company are interested in one thing: profit. Not saving you memory on ram.</p>

<p>But you don’t neccessarily want to increase the coffers of the big computer makers: you just want ram for for your laptop or desktop at a fair price. Maybe it’s the lowest price you can get on ram or maybe you’d prefer to spend a little more but whatever you choose you can get a much better deal on ram than when you buy it from the big computer manufacturers.</p>

<p>Part of the reason you can buy RAM cheaper from various 3rd party memory stores is that you’re buying generic ram. What’s generic ram? You’ve seen the no-name cereal at the grocery store, yes? It’s the same idea -you’re still buying corn flakes but you don’t get the fancy box or brand. Some memory stores actually carry two or more different types of RAM: Generic memory and brand name RAM so you can decide what ram to buy and whether you want to save money on ram or whether you’re willing to spend more and buy name brand ram, only you can decide that – as it’s your money you are spending on ram and memory.</p>

<p>But whatever you choose you can get the best <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com">RAM Memory Price</a> by comparing ram prices and make an informed memory buying decision.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2010/08/cost-of-macbook-pro-ram/">Cost of MacBook Pro RAM</a></h1>

<p>The <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_Pro_KITS_(1066_DDR3)/">cost of MacBook Pro RAM</a> is dropping.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The MacBook Pro memory modules get bigger in capacity size (not physical size) A year ago or so 4GB of RAM would have been tth most memory you could install in a MacBook Pro but now the MacBook Pro specifications have changed and you can now get 8GB of RAM into a MacBook Pro easily and relatively cheaply.</p>

<p>At time of writing and 8GB memory or ram upgrade kit for the new 2010 MacBook Pros can easily be achieved with just adding 2x4GB DDR3 1066Mhz so-dimms from a variety of memory stores for much much less money than you would pay for MacBook Pro memory just a year ago.</p>

<p>Every time I upgrade the memory prices they drop. At the time of writing it will cost you about $250 for an 8GB memory upgrade for a MacBook Pro. Now if you buy the MacBook Pro from the Apple Store you’ll end up paying a whole lot more than that – about double or more ($600 for MacBook Pro RAM from Apple as I write this) and there was a time when RAM mattered but really now it’s just what your budget will allow.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I"><img title="Cheapest Apple MacBook Pro" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-3.05.45-PM.png" alt="Best MacBook Pro Prices" width="294" height="209" /></a></p>

<p>When you buy the Apple RAM from Apple you get one thing and one thing only: better support. I’m not saying that when you buy the RAM elsewhere that it doesn’t come with great support but if you bought the RAM and the MacBook Pro from Apple you do get the reward of being able to take your MacBook Pro back to Apple and there’s less chance of Apple telling you your problems are due to the third party memory. It’s an easy way for Apple to get out of warranty troubles and blame the troubles you might be having with your MacBook Pro on the ‘bad ram’.</p>

<p>But no RAM is ‘bad ram’ these days. Any shady or questionable memory vendors have pretty much been wiped out by either their tactics catching up with them or the recession wiped ’em out completely. It’s like natural selection for memory stores if you will.<br />
RAM is a price competitive market and those that compete on price too much usually don’t last long due to the fact that they can’t afford the service that comes with the sale of MacBook memory.</p>

<p>The question of what is the best price for MacBook Pro RAM, or any ram for that matter is up to you. What do you want to pay for service and support? Buying RAM direct from apple is easy, yes but you’ll pay for the privilege of buying Apple branded memory upgrades.</p>

<p>You’re better off spending your money on RAM Upgrades and<a href="http://www.ramseeeker.com"> buy from memory stores you can trust</a> at prices that are much more competitive than any price that comes out of Apple for MacBook Pro RAM.</p>

<p><strong>Buy RAM for iMac.</strong> Do it. If you have an Apple iMac (or are considering buying an Apple iMac) you should fill that sucker with RAM.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8IO6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8IO6"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1316" title="Cheapest Apple iMacs" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-3.28.35-PM.png" alt="Best Deal on Apple iMacs" width="297" height="273" /></a></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8IO6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8IO6">Best Apple iMac</a></strong></p>

<p>I’ll tell you why, too. I’m going to guess that you bought that Apple iMac for the looks, the simplicity even maybe because it was the best deal on an Apple iMac you could get and you couldn’t pass on such a great Apple iMac Deal. Whatever your iMac buying reasons, there’s one thing you want it to do: run without problems.</p>

<p>More RAM for iMac does this. It allows your Apple iMac to breathe, if you will. All the technical mumbo-jumbo aside when you buy more ram for you iMac (and install it yourself, it’s easy) you give a fresh blast of fresh air to your computer. Ever been in a small space, say like an elevator and it’s just a little too…close? The iMac feels the same way when it’s running the numbers for you and massaging all that data for you so you can surf facebook or even make money with your iMac (if you’re using your iMac to make money than the argument for adding more iMac RAM just increased ten fold) . Your iMac need some space. We’re talking working space here. RAM for you iMac is like buying a bigger house. All of sudden you’ve got a bigger place and your iMac can run free and do all that heavy computing for you – all because you bought iMac RAM.</p>

<p>**Where to Buy RAM for iMac?<br />
**</p>

<p>[table id=2 /]</p>

<p>Yes, you can buy ram for iMac from Apple – and you may think that this is the best solution – they made the computer, right? So of course all the geniuses at the Apple store can help you with ram upgrades – and they can. You can order ram for the iMac online too and you can get it from the Apple Store. The problem when you buy ram from apple directly is hoo boy is it pricey.<br />
You do get the excellent apple support and at one time, there was actually apple ram and windows ram but not any more – as long as RAM for your iMac meets the apple specifications, you can buy iMac RAM a lot cheaper from more than one memory store.</p>

<p>As luck would have it, I have made a list of all the places you can buy ram for iMac. There’s lots more stores than the memory stores I list of course, but all the memory stores I list I can recommend. In fact, most memory stores have been selling ram for iMacs since the very first iMac with that funky teal color and round mouse and for that you get piece of mind knowing you can buy iMac ram for less but it’s still guaranteed to work in your iMac without trouble. And in the slight chance that there is a problem with your <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/iMac_KITS_(DDR3_1333)/">RAM for iMac,</a> these stores will work with you to sort out any ram problems you might have with your iMac RAM.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_Pro_KITS_(1066_DDR3)/">best MacBook Pro RAM</a> is best price you can get for MacBook Pro Memory.</p>

<p>You might prefer to <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com">order RAM</a> directly from Apple. Yes, it’s expensive for what it is (you’re more than halfway to a new macbook). But you do get great support from Apple in the slight chance that something goes wrong. For no other reason Apple won’t be able to give you a hard time for non-apple memory if you have MacBook Pro problems down the road (hey, it’s possible). Apple won’t be able to give you the run around about not using apple memory and might blame the bad ram on the third party ram.</p>

<p>But I know a better way to get the best MacBook Pro RAM and it sure doesn’t include Apple. In fact, I’ve got a handy-dandy price lis of all ram for macbook pros from very reputable online memory stores that appreciate and respect the Apple user and customer. In the past the list used to be longer but after a while I got tired of all the complaints about certain online stores (you know who you are) so I’ve settled on this bunch of memory stores to list MacBook Pro RAM prices as they offer fair prices on MacBook Pro memory and in the small chance you do have problems with your MacBook ram, they will be there for you just like Apple will but at least they’ll be a lot cheaper than apple memory.</p>

<p>DDR3 1066 for MacBook Pro is the memory type you want and if you’ve got a Spring 2010 MacBook Pro (or some older MBP’s too) you can upgrade to the maximum of 8GB of RAM and I suggest you do to get the most out of your MacBook Pro. You spent a good dollar on your MacBook Pro to get the fancy extra firewire, faster processor, light up keyboard and a bunch of other features, so it seems silly to me to scrimp on RAM. RAM prices for MacBook Pros have dropped considerably for the 1066 DDR 3 memory and now what you would have paid over$1000 for you can now buy 8GB of RAM for MacBook Pros for less – about $250 as I write this. That’s about half what you’d pay if you bought from Apple too. There’s nothing wrong with Apple RAM but you pay for it. Even brand name ram like Crucial is loads cheaper for MacBook Pro RAM.</p>

<p>Buy the most RAM you can afford for your MacBook Pro and you won’t regret buying MacBook Pro RAM as your MacBook will be topped up and running at maximum performance too, and that’s the best MacBook Pro RAM – The maximum RAM in your MacBook Pro at an affordable price you are comfortable with when shopping and buying ram for your MacBook Pro.</p>

<p>These are for the Mac Pros that now require 1333MHz  RAM. The 1066Mhz memory is still a current model as now any Mac Pro you buy could take two different types of RAM depending on what 2010 Mac Pro you buy and want to upgrade the memory for:</p>

<p>The 2.4GHz Apple Mac Pro still use the same 1066Mhz DDR SDRAM DIMMS that previous models use. My guess is that Apple will discontinue this Mac Pro model sooner or later once the faster memory and processors get cheaper. (they always do)</p>

<p>The 2.66GHz and 2.93GHz Apple Mac Pro models is where the new 1333Mhz RAM applies and now you’ve got a slew of selections to choose depending on what Mac Pro you have and how much memory you want to install in them.</p>

<p>As always I have added two different methods you can shop for memory: by looking for prices on individual<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/Mac_Pro_DDR3_1333/" title="mac pro memory modules"> Mac Pro memory modules </a>or by shopping for ram as a package deal and buying it in a memory upgrade kits. The new Mac Pros offer 8 slots for memory upgrades and depending on how badly you need the performance you can fill your Mac Pro with up to 64GB of RAM now. It won’t be cheap but it’s possible.</p>

<p>You now have three different options for shopping for Mac Pro Memory and  RAM upgrade kits:</p>

<p>Depending on your Mac Pro memory needs or budget you can buy Mac Pro RAM upgrades in every configuration  imagineable from 4GB all the way to 64GB of ram for Mac Pro.</p>

<p>The new MacBook Pros from Apple come standard with  4GB installed as default.  Some of the older MacBooks can also accept a maximum of 4GB and until just recently – as in a month ago – 4GB was the maximum in most MacBook Pros on sale by Apple.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW"><img class="size-full wp-image-1314 alignleft" title="Best MacBook Pro RAM" alt="Cheapest MacBook Pro RAM" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-3.25.50-PM.png" width="309" height="208" /></a></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW">8GB MacBook Pro RAM under $100</a></strong></p>

<p>To answer your question? It depends.</p>

<p>[table id=15 /]</p>

<p>I know it sounds kind of vague so let me explain: I’ve got a text document open and so it takes some RAM to run Mac OS and  a wee bit more to launch and keep open the application  (and a few other application  I have open like Mail and Safari ).</p>

<p>And then my Mac waits. for me. Even if I could fill my MacBook Pro with 64GB of RAM my mac’s still going to be waiting for me to type another letter or character. I type about 40 words per minute and let me tell you the speed of the RAM is much faster than that.</p>

<p>But let’s say I then go out and record a full HD movie at the biggest full high definition resolution and download that video to my computer so I can share with my friends the great time I had at the beach or dinner or whatever..I made a movie and I want to share it.</p>

<p>But first I want to edit the movie and take out the part where I dropped the camera in the sand and then there was the part in the movie where I was just loading the car so I don’t want my friends to see all the junk I have in my trunk. I also want to make some cool little  titles  and fades and other stuff in iMovie so  at the end of the movie my friends say “wow that’s a great movie”.  To do all that is going to take a whole lot more ram than the stock ram configuration that comes with the MacBook Pro. And even if I could do all my movie editing with the current ram – more ram can’t hurt. Moving those pixels around whether it’s still or video takes a whole  lot more processing power and memory than the stock configuration of MacBook Pro.</p>

<p>Also there’s the saying, and I’m sure you’ve heard it: You can never have enough ram or hard drive space. I’ve never regretted buying RAM. Even if it’s been too much at the time of purchase. RAM is cheap. You can fill  up your MacBook Pro for about $200 and this  is much cheaper than some software like Photoshop or Lightroom even.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_Pro_(1066_DDR3)-4gb/" title="4gb ram macbook pro">4GB for the MacBook Pros </a>will do just fine for facebook, email and light computing such as word processing. When you get into the processor intensive stuff like photo editing or movie editing  – buy all the RAM you can afford.</p>

<p>That’s a question I get asked a lot – probably second after ‘what is the best memory, or what is the cheapest memory. And ramseeker isn’t the easiest to navigate sometimes if you don’t know what type of memory you have I also get asked what ram do I need for my computer? (BTW,  if you need help with your memory upgrades feel free to email me. I’m here to help you with your ram upgrades)</p>

<p>Back to the best RAM brand. There’s two ways you can buy ram: one that will save you the most money or for a little more money you can buy brand name ram which comes with the knowledge that you paid a bit more for your ram but at least it’s a brand name you can trust.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW"><img title="Best Selling RAM" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-3.30.51-PM.png" alt="Cheap Kingston RAM" width="307" height="184" /></a></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW">Kingston RAM: Best Selling Memory Upgrades</a></strong></p>

<p>This applies to anything, really and not just ram. Even computers are priced this way – you can buy an Apple Computer  (and pay for the privilege) or you can buy a lesser bran  name.  Once I needed a PC to run some windows program so I found the  cheapest laptop I could find. It worked great for the price but support was non-exisitent as when I needed help with my PC (it was a windows machine. it’s only a matter of time before you need help) the company was long out of business. It was a no-name laptop and I got no-name support to match.</p>

<p>With RAM though you’re better off because even generic memory gets tested to work from the memory vendors before it ships and if you buy ram regardless of brand from the stores I list you won’t have a problem with RAM not working. These stores are all reputable memory vendors and I have mentioned this before.</p>

<p>Some brands you might see are toshiba, samsung, micron (which is crucial), lexar for digital camera ram…just to name a few. It all comes down to your comfort level and what’s most  important to you – getting the cheapest RAM you can buy or spending a  littl more for brand name ram. Your budget and memory needs  all come into play when you need to buy memory – brand name or generic, the choice is ultimately up to you.</p>

<p>So you want to know the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/pc/index.php#lowest" title="cheapest pc ram">cheapest ram right now</a>?</p>

<p>Before I can answer that we need a bit of information before I can begin to help you. Do you have a mac or pc? Are you looking for ram for your digital camera? how about a memory stick?</p>

<p>What size of RAM can your mac/pc/digital camera take?</p>

<p>What type of memory can your mac/pc/digital camera use?</p>

<p>We’re not done yet.  Do you have a memory or ram budget? You’re in the market for the cheapest RAM and you’re definitely at the right place but I want you to understand that price – and this is for any thing, not just ram – is only part of the package deal when shopping for RAM and Memory Upgrades</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00200K1SY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00200K1SY"><img title="Cheapest Camera RAM" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-3.43.05-PM.png" alt="Cheap RAM for Digital Cameras" width="290" height="314" /></a></p>

<p>Do you care if the ram is name brand ram or are you happy with generic ram? How about used ram? That actually would be the cheapest ram, but it’s used and  any savings you might acquire buy shopping for used ram could be eaten up by support costs and other habits. You can sell your old ram too and that would make your new ram even cheaper or at very least – offset the costs of  ram when you are ready to buy new ram.</p>

<p>How about a gurantee? do you need one?  What if by chance, the ram goes bad. Do you want or need a 1-800 phone number to call? Are you OK with email support? Are you a whiz kid who knows all there ever needs to know about ram and memory and you’re just in the market for the lowest price ram and you don’t care about support for your ram purchase.</p>

<p>These are all things to consider when  you need to buy ram and you are in the need for cheapest ram. The cheapest ram for an older notebook for blogging means a whole other thing if you’re looking to upgrade hundreds of computers at the same time. Saving a few dollars in ram in this case might not be worth it.</p>

<p>How are you going  to pay for the ram . Visa, mastercard?  Paypal? <a href="http://www.canadianonlinebanking.com" title="canadian online banking">wire the money</a> to the vendor? Purchase Order? All of these different payment offer differernt fee structures and payment terms. For the hobbyist a credit card works best probably. For the commercial order you’re probably want to go with a store that will accept your PO. so  you can cross the ‘upgrade office computers’ task off your to do list.</p>

<p>Once you’ve decided  on all these options and probably a few I haven’t even thought of then I can help you<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="buy the cheapest ram"> buy the cheapest RAM </a>for the right price with the right features you need for your application.</p>
