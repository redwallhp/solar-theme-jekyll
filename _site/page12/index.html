		<div class="post-content"><p>This is <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/">the article</a> that started me down the road to thinking about <a href="http://ramseeker.com/2016/switched-to-jekyll-from-wordpress/">ditching wordpress</a> and using <a href="http://www.jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> as my new blogging tool of choice.</p>

<p>This is time well spent learning how to do this, as you get a free website hosting and plain text sites are much faster than a wordpress site too.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Jekyll takes your content written in Markdown, passes it through your templates and spits it out as a complete static website, ready to be served. GitHub Pages conveniently serves the website directly from your GitHub repository so that you don’t have to deal with any hosting.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>eero is the world’s first home WiFi system. A set of three eeros covers the typical home. They work in perfect unison to deliver hyper-fast, super-stable WiFi to every square foot of your house. It’s simple to set up. Easy to manage. And gets better over time with new features and improved performance. Stream video, get work done, or swipe right in any room — not just next to your router. Finally. WiFi that actually works.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wonder what it would be like to be able to get wi-fi in the kitchen behind the fridge?</p>

<p>They are a bit pricier than the typical $100 router, but they look easier to setup and use too.</p>

<p>This feature sounds like it would be very useful:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Keep is great for making lists, for example a shopping list. If you actually title one of your lists “shopping list,” you can add new items to it without even opening the app. It’s a simple matter of pulling up your Google voice search by tapping the mic in the search bar or using the “OK Google” hotword.</p>

<p>It sure was hard to choose a Mac in 1996 - You forget how many models Apple had back then. This is a great list, and look back to a time when all was beige.</p>

<p>I bought one of these Micro SD cards to toss in my phone and they work great. I have more music downloaded than I ever really need. Spring for the brand name - I’ve bought cheaper ones on eBay and they are too slow. This is well worth the $20 or so it cost me.</p>
