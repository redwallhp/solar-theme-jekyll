  <p>Last year we published a Google Tag Manager Guide to help you start using Google Tag Manager for event tracking.  Since then, Google has upgraded all Google Tag Manager accounts to Version 2.  This updated Google Tag Manager tutorial contains revised information about how to use the new GTM v2 to track important events on your website like link clicks, downloads, and form submissions.</p>

<p><a href="https://eero.com/">eero - Finally, WiFi that works</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>eero is the world’s first home WiFi system. A set of three eeros covers the typical home. They work in perfect unison to deliver hyper-fast, super-stable WiFi to every square foot of your house. It’s simple to set up. Easy to manage. And gets better over time with new features and improved performance. Stream video, get work done, or swipe right in any room — not just next to your router. Finally. WiFi that actually works.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wonder what it would be like to be able to get wi-fi in the kitchen behind the fridge?</p>

<p>They are a bit pricier than the typical $100 router, but they look easier to setup and use too.</p>

<p>This feature sounds like it would be very useful:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Keep is great for making lists, for example a shopping list. If you actually title one of your lists “shopping list,” you can add new items to it without even opening the app. It’s a simple matter of pulling up your Google voice search by tapping the mic in the search bar or using the “OK Google” hotword.</p>

<p>It sure was hard to choose a Mac in 1996 - You forget how many models Apple had back then. This is a great list, and look back to a time when all was beige.</p>

<p>I bought one of these Micro SD cards to toss in my phone and they work great. I have more music downloaded than I ever really need. Spring for the brand name - I’ve bought cheaper ones on eBay and they are too slow. This is well worth the $20 or so it cost me.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>OS X is an Apple interface wrapped around a Unix core, whereas Ubuntu is a Unix interface wrapped around a Unix core. This makes switching from OS X much easier than switching from Windows, but still quite challenging. For example, the OS X terminal is almost as powerful as the Linux terminal, but you’ll need to use far more of that power in Linux.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This paragraph nails it. It takes some time, but once you get the hang of the terminal in Ubuntu this makes the Ubuntu eperience well worth the switch. I’ve done it.</p>

		<div class="post-content"><p>I have recently become more interested in Ubuntu than Mac OS in recent months, mostly in part becasue my needs are so light that I don’t need to cough up so much money to buy an Apple computer when a cheaper alternative is available.</p>

<p>I am writing this on a used Thinkpad for under $100 (about the same price as 16GB of RAM for the Mac) that I tossed Ubuntu on and I get a working computer for writing or blogging and even some light image editing.</p>

<p>But, if you wanted to make a hackintosh out of an older thinkpad - it seems you can:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Follow these steps to perform a clean installation of OS X 10.11 El Capitan on your ThinkPad x220 or x220 Tablet.
– If you already have OS X 10.10 Yosemite on your x220 we recommend doing a clean installation of El Capitan, not an update from the existing installation.
– See the guide here to install OS X 10.10 Yosemite on the ThinkPad x220
– See the guide here to dual-boot OS X and Windows
