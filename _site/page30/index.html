    <h1><a href="/2011/11/sennheiser-hd-25-1-headphone-review/">Sennheiser HD 25-1 Headphone Review</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content">I have owned these Sennheiser headphones for more than five years now, but only recently have they seen any real great use from me but I thought hey, I may as well write a quick review on these as they have withstood the test of  time, and  as I see when I check prices for Sennheiser headphones, <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TDZOXG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000TDZOXG">they sure have come down in price too</a></strong>.

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TDZOXG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000TDZOXG"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4291" title="sennheiser hd-25 review" alt="best price on HD-25's" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/JIM_33701-600x398.jpg" width="600" height="398" /></a>

<em>The HD-25' are  a pretty sweet sounding headphone for the money. </em>

When I first bought these, I paid way more money than what you can get these great headphones for now, as I paid over $400 and now with a bit of shopping for some of the better deals on headphones you can get  a much better price.

These are closed back headphones, and except for using apple earbuds or my favorite earbud headphones - the <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004RE5ZCI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004RE5ZCI">Sony MDR EX 310LP</a>, </strong>so I can't compare how they sound  to  open backed headphones like the HD600 or HD650, but I can guess the sound signature would be similar across the sennheiser line for 2012.

<strong>How Do They Sound?</strong>

Oh, boy. Reviewing audio equipment is much trickier than say <a href="http://www.dcresource.com">digital camera reviews </a>where you can take photos and  compare. the output.

Audio is so subjective anyway. My wife loves bass and top 40 hits, while to my brother in law prefers more treble. So, unlike audio magazines I won't  glow about these phones and  how they changed my life with their detailed highs and deep bass because everybody has a preference.  To me, they sound pretty good. I can wear them for hours without fatigue and they have no problem with music from a high end  audio rig or just an iPod or iPad.

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4290" title="Sennheiser HD 25-1" alt="cheap sennheiser HD 25-1" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/JIM_3371-600x398.jpg" width="600" height="398" />

Truth be told, I'm not an expert  on music , but I know what I like and these little senny's  are really  a good headphone and  though I  haven't heard the beats line of products from Monster, I could hazard a good guess that these would offer much more value.

<strong>Not Noise Canceling, But Close</strong>

One of the reasons these little headphones are so good is due to their design. The closed back means you don't have a lot of sound leakage when wearing these  - either noise going out or in, and this allows you to immerse yourself  in what's important and that's the music. I never got the idea of noise canceling  headphones that tended to add noise instead of just blocking  out the outside noise in the first place.

But you're not entirely shut off from the world when listening to these headphones, meaning you can still be aware  of  your surroundings. Perhaps due to lifestyle mostly (I'm an old guy and stay inside)  I tend to use these in and ar0und  the house as opposed to using  them  as street headphones. On the rare occasions I do need headphones outside, I tend to use the Sony earbuds.

<em>The senny's are detailed and offer a realistic and  neutral sound that doesn't flavor the recordings </em>

<strong>Comfortable Headphones </strong>

I have two confessions to make when it coms to these headphones - the very first was that at first they were the most uncomfortable phones I have ever used, but then I realized two things: I have a pretty big head which isn't helping matters any and the second thing is  that  I didn't  realize until very recently that you could seperate the headband for a better fit. This is one of those times that reading the manual would  help. I found that by leaving the headphones over the back of my couch for a few hours fixed the problem of the headphones being too tight.

Also, because I wear glasses - the phones are on hear headphones  and not over the ear, so there's pressure on your ears which in turn was pressing on the arms of my glasses and that was uncomfortable to say the least. If I adjust the glasses on my head so there's less pressure on the glasses frames I fare much better and can listen for a few hours every listening  session.

<strong>Summary </strong>

These are lightweight headphones at just over 5 oz, so I find them to be light, comfortable, and precise and neutral when it comes to sound, that I like. I've never had to, but you can replace the earpads and replace the cable with an audiophile cable if you wan't  to customize the HD-25's further.  If there's one qualm I do have is that the cable connection to the  phones can get loose and I'm down to just one channel instead of stereo headphone listening. A wiggle  of the red connector fixes this with ease and this does not happen often enough to be a problem .

<p>The Apple Mac mini was an innovative attempt to tap into the consumer market with an entry level Mac desktop computer. The Mac mini is remarkable for its small size as well as the fact that it comes with no display, keyboard or mouse—and after its initial introduction, no built in optical drive. Apple promoted this as BYOKDM (aka “Bring Your Own…” and was aimed at users who might already have these compatible peripherals to justify the lower cost.</p>

<p>The original Mac Mini did not include a server version but did have an optical drive. Going forward from the first Mac mini revision in the summer of 2010, all versions of the mini included the server version as part of the Mac OS X operating system, the 2011 configurations eliminated the optical drive.</p>

<p>The Apple Mac mini Intel Core i5 2.5 GHz features the aluminum unibody design that replaced the original chassis which featured a polycarbonate top and bottom panels on the aluminum case. The unit measures 7.7 inches (19.7 cm) square and 1.4 inches (3.6 cm) tall. It weighs 2.7 pounds (1.22 kg). The processor that shipped with the computer was a 2.5GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 with 3MB on-chip shared L3 cache, custom configurable to 2.7GHz dual-core Intel Core i7.</p>

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>The Apple iMac 2.5GHz Intel Quad-core i5 was first introduced May3, 2011 and represented a significant improvement in processor speed and state of the art connectivity.</p>

<p>The Apple iMac 2.5 GHz i5 shipped with a 32 nm, 64-bit Intel Core i5 “Sandy Bridge” processor with quad cores (4 independent processor cores on a single silicon chip, each with one thread). Each core has a dedicated256k level 2 cache and the processor cores share a single 6 MB level 3 cache It also supports Turbo Boost 2.0 (up to 3.3 GHz) — which “automatically boosts the processor speed based on workload” (that is if an application is only using one of the four cores it will automatically increase the speed of the core in use and turn off the unused cores).</p>

    <h1><a href="/2011/10/how-much-memory-can-i-buy-with-one-hundred-dollars/">How Much Memory Can I Buy With One Hundred Dollars?</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>I got asked this today, so thought I would share my answer here as I feel that RAM for your computer  is the best upgrade you can do for both your Mac or  PC and with RAM prices being so cheap right now,  a hundred  bucks goes pretty far, and if you can afford to double that hundred dollars to two hundred dollars you’ll find you may be able to buy not only enough RAM to fill your notebook or desktop, but if you can live with a smaller sized boot drive you can also upgrade to a SSD for even more savings.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>$100 worth of RAM </strong></p>

<p>You could easily fill any 2011 notebook with enough RAM for the hundred  bucks, and unless you are in the need for 16GB of RAM in a notebook with only 2 memory upgrade slots, 8GB of RAM is more cost efficient and with rebate, costs close to a third of that cost overall.</p>

<p>Corsair  notebook RAM is  the cheapest 8GB RAM I could find  and with a rebate until the end of the month that drops the price down to $37, you’re not even anywhere near your hundred dollar budget and for most notebooks, the 8GB RAM Upgrade is more than enough and you’ll still increase the  performance of your notebook for much less than the hundred dollars you have set aside.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002YUF8ZG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=B002YUF8ZG">Buy 8GB Memory ON Sale for under $100. </a></strong></p>

<p><strong>$100 worth of hard drive. </strong></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003NE5JCE/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B003NE5JCE">Cheapest SSD Drive</a></strong></p>

<p>There’s even more choice when it comes to buying a new hard drive to replace the stock and ever shrinking stock hard drive that came with your computer. You can buy a big conventional hard drive if you care more about  storage space than speed, or if a faster hard drive i  what you’re after replace the drive you have with a much faster (but smaller) SSD drive. 60GB SSD’s are under $100 and 128BB SSD’s are dropping in price too if you can wait a bit longer before you upgrade to a solid state drive.</p>

<p>Another option is the Seagate Momentus XP that offers the best of both worlds: 4gb of SSD storage for your operating system and othet  commonly used files and 500GB of storage space so you’re not limited to drive space. This is especially important for notebook computer users who want to carry all their files with them for easy access at any time.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003NSBF32/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=B003NSBF32"><strong>Momentus XP by Seagate</strong></a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>$100 gets you far more memory and  hard drive space than even when compared to a year ago and with ram prices so low it’s never been a better time for a ram upgrade.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002YUF8ZG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=B002YUF8ZG">Buy  RAM (or anything else) from Amazon  for what I have found to be the best prices online overall. </a></strong></p>

    <h1><a href="/2011/10/what-is-the-sweet-spot-for-hp-envy-ram/">What is the Sweet Spot for HP Envy RAM?</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>The HP envy is a fast notebook computer from HP designed for the professional notebook user in mind. Sure, there are cheaper notebooks from HP that do the job when it comes to the simple stuf like web browsing and social networking, but if you want to play games or get work done you need a more powerful processor the HP Envy provides.</p>

<p>Take the popular <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051OLNHE/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B0051OLNHE">HP ENVY 14-2050SE Beats Special Edition notebook</a> for example. This HP Envy notebook already comes with 6GB of RAM as default memory and if your notebook computing needs are light you can stop reading right here. **6GB of RAM is enough for web surfing or blogging or any other lighter computer task.<br />
**</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051OLNHE/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B0051OLNHE"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3259" title="HP Envy Beats special edition" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Screen-Shot-2011-10-19-at-5.15.02-PM.png" alt="HP Envy SSD Deals" width="305" height="279" /></a></p>

<p>But, if you need to do some work or play games the maximum RAM for this particular notebook tops out at 16GB of RAM, but this ram upgrade for HP Envy’s is still a tad pricey at $600 or so and so you’re much better off if you limit your HP Envy RAM needs to 8GB for the time being.</p>

<p>If you want to save money and seeing as this particular HP Envy already ships with 6GB when shipped from HP you could forgo a ram upgrade altogether as there’s really <strong>little difference between 6GB of RAM and 8GB for HP Envy notebooks</strong>. Even though RAM for HP Envy notebooks are pretty cheap, you would be much better off forgetting about a RAM upgrade for HP notebooks and installing a solid state drive into your HP Envy laptop instead if you feel the need to maximize the performance of your HP laptop.</p>

<p>The benefits of a faster solid state hard drive far outweigh any advantage you would see by adding just 2GB of RAM to a 6GB equipped HP notebook already. But, by swapping out the factory HP envy drive with the faster SSD you’ll spend just a bit more as <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004W2JKWG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B004W2JKWG">quality name brand SSD drives are on sale</a></strong> for about $100 these days and up. Still a bit pricey, but when compared to the cost of 16GB for HP envy, the solid state drive is the best upgrade for the HP notebook you can buy in 2011.</p>

<p>Wait until we’re a few months into 2012 at least before you consider upgrading the HP envy RAM to the maximum of 16GB allowed and just get by with the 6GB for now. Save your money for a much cheaper 16GB ram upgrade next year as the prices for 8GB laptop memory will continue to drop to a more stable level and <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/deal-ocz-technology-60-gb-vertex-2-series-sata-ii-2-5-inch-solid-state-drive-ssd-drops-to-under-100/" title="Deal. OCZ Technology 60 GB Vertex 2 Series SATA II 2.5-Inch Solid State Drive (SSD) Drops to Under $100">buy a cheap solid state hard drive </a> instead if you want to upgrade you  HP envy notebook.</p>

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>I have mentioned before I am *this close* to moving to the USA and one of the things that the USA offers over Canada is choice. I can choose  my internet provider, home  phone service, even email web host to be three different companies offering services, or.. you can buy all three online services from one provider and in my case that would be from Verizon as I already have Verizon wireless service from them and might as well pay one bill for all three and probably save some money in the process.</p>

<h2 id="introducing-verizoncentral">Introducing VerizonCentral</h2>

<p>Verizon Central is a website that’s a front door or portal or everyday start page for your browser which allows you not  only quick and easy login to your verizon wireless account, but a slew of other features including news, weather and other fun stuff too:</p>

<p><strong>Most Popular News</strong></p>

<p>This is pretty self explanatory. The biggest news of the day is displayed here, and constantly updates.</p>

<p><strong>More News</strong></p>

<p>In addition to the headline news, there’s more news in not only the news, but also in Entertainment, Sports, Today’s Deal of the Day, and the trending today chart offers what’s hot when you search using Verizon Central. Local News is  also offered so not only do you get to read international  and national news, you’ll be up to date in your community thanks to Verizon Central.</p>

<p><strong>Watch TV Online. </strong></p>

<p>This might be the biggest advantage to Verizon Central – the ability to watch TV right from your computer.</p>

<p><strong>Today in History </strong></p>

<p>This section allows you to look back at what was happening not only a year ago today, but also for other dates in history  that share the same date as today.</p>

<p><strong>Verizon Sign In</strong></p>

<p>Maybe I should have put this right at the top, but this might be the main reason you visit Verizon Central – to login to your Verizon Account, and  the Verizon web portal allows you to do just that with ease. Of course, you can also register for a Verizon Central Account if you don’t have one yet too.</p>

<p>**Local Weather Forecasts **keep you up to date on not only the latest weather conditions in your area, but also what’s in store for the weather in the upcoming days.</p>

<p>The Verizon Central Web Portal is a very good way to start your day and keeps you up to date and entertained as well with all the news and topics important  to you.</p>

<p>**VerizonEmail **When you sign up for Verizon cable services, you get a free and easy to remember email address for your personal email. In my case, my verizon email adresss might be ramseeker@verizon.net which is pretty easy to remember when you think about it compared to some of the domain extensions from other internet service providers.</p>
