   <B> <h1><a href="/2011/11/how-to-force-quit-mac-applications-that-dont-respond/">How To Force Quit Mac Applications That Don&#8217;t Respond</a></h1></B>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content">As great as Apple Computer is, there are times when either the Mac OS operating system or the application itself doesn&#8217;t work as it should resulting in you having to stop what you&#8217;re doing  and deal with this troublesome application that doesn&#8217;t want to play nice with your Mac.

**How To Force Quit Mac Software. **

One of the most common indicators that something is wrong with your Apple is  when you&#8217;re left sitting there waiting for your software to respond, and then after a while you realize that even on the slowest Apple computer made today &#8211; something is wrong with your Mac.

Sometimes,  the Mac will display the indicator or spinwheel displaying that it&#8217;s trying to catch up, but don&#8217;t be fooled &#8211; that appllication is stuck, even if the wheel is spinning your Mac gave up the ghost long ago.

When you&#8217;re ready to force quit Mac software, all you have to do is:

From the Apple Menu in the top left hand corner of your screen** choose the force quit menu item. **Alternately, you can use the keyboard and  hi**t Command &#8211; Option &#8211; Escape** to exit the Mac Application too. Lastly, the third way to force quit is to right click on the Application icon in the dock and  choose force quit. All three get you to the same result:quitting  the Mac software.

I suggest two things to make sure you see less chances of even needing to force quit  Apple software: The first, is to be sure you have enough ram installed. ram is cheap and one reason your application keeps hanging is that you don&#8217;t have enough ram to run the software for your Mac in the first  place.

My last suggestion is to restart your Mac.This is an optional step and not  required, but I have found more times than not that a good reboot fixes a lot of computer problems.

If you find yourself needing to force quite your Mac a lot, you may want to take your Mac into see an Apple Genius, or contact Apple Support to be sure there&#8217;s not  a problem with your Mac that a force quit will not fix.

   <B> <h1><a href="/2011/11/how-to-find-the-nearest-verizon-locations/">How To Find The Nearest Verizon Locations</a></h1></B>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content">Maybe it&#8217;s the old guy in me, and even though I have been working in online sales for over a decade I never really ordered that much stuff online and would prefer to go to the store in person to check stuff out and decide whether I ant to spend  my money on a product or service.

There&#8217;s lots of reasons why I prefer to shop in person, but one of the best reasons is you can sometimes get a better deal if you shop at the store as opposed to shopping online. I have found more deals by physically  being in the right place at the right time.

This old school style of shopping especially holds true to cellular phones too. Usually they are staffed by eager kids who can work the phones with one hand  in seconds, as opposed to my old  fingers trying to figure out how to transfer my contacts from my memory card or some other problem.

And speaking of problems, one problem you have to solve first is the fact that you need to know where to go. When shopping online, you either do a google search for what you want to buy, or a good  place to check is also from Amazon, as &#8211; and  this especially holds true in the  USA &#8211; chances are they will have i &#8211; **[in stock and on sale][1]**.

When it comes to finding Verizon stores in my area, I have found it easiest  to ask the[** mother ship** ][2]rather than do a google  search and  weed through the sites that can&#8217;t help you.

Verizon offers a handy dandy [Verizon Store Locator][3] where all you have to do is enter either your  zip code, or start your search for the best Verizon location for you by choosing your state and then after you do that you pick your city. You will be presented with  a list of  the closes verizon stores and you get to choose the radius of your search  from 5 miles, 15 miles, 25miles, or 75miles, depending on how far you want to travel.

This is the easiest way to find the best and  Nearest Verizon Locations so that you can go in person for either Verizon sales or support.

   <B> <h1><a href="/2011/11/exploring-insurance-options-with-zander-insurance/">Exploring Insurance Options With Zander Insurance</a></h1></B>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content">I&#8217;m about to get married in the new year, and move to the USA from Canada, and if there&#8217;s one area I have no idea when it  comes to living in the USA , it&#8217;s about insurance or banking and I find that the best way I learn is to write as I go so here I am today &#8211; exploring the Zander  Insurance Group.

**Dave Ramsey Endorsed**

The very first thing I noticed when visiting Zander  is that Dave Ramsey  is all over this site, so either this is his own company or just one he endorses, there&#8217;s a lot of  goodwill from Dave ([further reading ][1]shows that Dave just endorses the company and  that this insurance company has been around some time &#8211; since the 1920&#8217;s)

**Zander Term Life Insurance. **

Zander claims to have 80 years experience with Term Life Insurance, and they recognize how important Term Life Insurance is to a family&#8217;s future. You can get an  instant quote for Zander Term Inssurance and find out how cheap Term Life Insurance can be.

**Zander Disability Insurance**

Health is so important. It beats fancy cars,  iPads, the latest cell phones or even memory upgrades. If you&#8217;re not happy and healthy than it doesn&#8217;t matter how rich you are and with Zander Disability Insurance you can get covered in the case that you do become ill? I know this will be something I will look into further as I am not getting any younger, and although my job of sitting at the computer is hardly taxing  (boring sometimes) I could get hurt &#8211; either on the job or at home and I should  be sure I am covered in case that happens.

**Zander Identity Theft Insurance**

To be honest, I don&#8217;t really think too much about Identity theft, I mean am not a celebrity by any means,  and there&#8217;s lots of other Identities I could think of swiping other than my own, But, this is another type of insurance  I should  consider  too, as I am sure it&#8217;s the  world&#8217;s biggest pain  to get your identity back and Zander would keep  me insured from this event happening

**Zander Auto Insurance**

I don&#8217;t have a car to drive right now, but as I will be moving from the big city to the suburbs, I may need a car in the near future and it looks like Zander insurance may just be what I am looking for when it comes to car  insurance. Sure, there are much bigger car insurance companies out  there, but I can get a free quote on Car insurance quickly and easily using their online insurance quote form.

Financial Guru Dave Ramsey endorses this insurance company fully, so it will definitely be on my shortlist when it comes time to start insurance shopping in the USA.

   <B> <h1><a href="/2011/11/kingston-memory-vs-crucial-memory-which-memory-brand-is-best/">Kingston Memory vs Crucial Memory: Which Memory Brand is Best?</a></h1></B>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content">When I started ramseeker, the computer ram I compared the most was generic  memory and not RAM from brand name memory  like [Crucial][1] or [Kingston Memory][2]  as ram for both desktop and notebook computers was so expensive that it made no sense to install brand name memory in your PC or Mac when the generic memory would work just  as well.

<div style="float: right; margin-right: 5px;">
</div>

** Then, RAM Prices Dropped**

And all of sudden you could consider buying brand name ram from manaufacturers that no only sell the memory but make it too. I like to think that even though all the memory stores on ramseeker are on the up and up, buying name brand ram for you  computer just feels, well a little more secure.

It used to be that the brand name memory from Crucial was very expensive &#8211; in part due to the fact that they advertised heavily to create a brand. Crucial has only been around since the early 90&#8217;s. Compared to other industries, the RAM business is quite young.

Both of the memory brands &#8211;  Kingston or Crucial offer something generic sellers really can&#8217;t compete with and that&#8217;s customer support and warranty. Because these two brands make their own memory upgrades it&#8217;s easier for them to support the memory in the rare case of a problem with the RAM upgrade.

Asking which memory brand is better is kind of like asking the chicken or egg question. There&#8217;s no right answer. This i  ford versus chevy, or republican vs democrat &#8211; you&#8217;ll tend to favor one brand over the other. I have found that Crucial memory to be a little easier to buy online than Kingston but this is changing too as both Kingston Memory and Crucial Memory are on sale and a fraction of the price they were just one year ago.

**One More Brand**

Another memory brand you should consider when you&#8217;re ready to buy memory is [Corsair][3] memory. These folks used to charge an arm and a leg for RAM, but now tend to be one of the **cheaper memory brands you can buy today**.

I&#8217;ve lost my way in the past few years when it comes to what is the best home theater receiver from Denon. I used to be really into HT in the early 2000&#8217;s but in the past few years I have been disinterested in what is available for A/V receivers and have been quite  happy with my[ Yamaha RXV-2400 ][1] for my home theater processing, but now I have the chance to create a brand new home theater from scratch as I have an unfinished basement and I would like to start researching new gear for my new home theater in 2012 and one brand I have always admired is Denon for home theater.

**Ten Best Denon Home Theater Receivers for 2012. **

**[Denon AVR 5308i(A)][2]**

[<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3955" title="denon5308 on sale" alt="Best price on Denon 5308" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/denon5308.jpg" width="300" height="300" />][2]

This is the flagship home theater receiver from Denon, and at $5499.00 this is one expensive receiver for those that demand the very best for home audio and video processing. The full feature set on this big receiver is too much to list, but as you can imagine this is one big honking machine that offers all modern home audio features such as 9.3 channels of amplification at 1050 watts in total, 4 source and zone selection and network wifi and streaming on this big brute of an amp.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**[Denon AVR 4810][3]**

[<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3960" title="denon 4810 deal" alt="best price on Denon 4810" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/denon4810.jpg" width="300" height="300" />][3]

Want to save over $2000 on a modern home theater a/v receiver? Buy this model instead of the 5308 from Denon . The 4810  is on sale  too at Amazon where you can knock off another $500, bringing the b**[est price for the Denon AVR4810][3]** down to about $2500. This is still a bit much for me to pay for a home theater amp, but you could buy two of these on sale for  the same price of one Denon 53083.

And this is no slouch either: This too offers 9.3 channels that include wifi and home networking features for whole home audio.

Each channel offers 140 watts of amplification and the monoblock design offers high end fidelity not just as a HT amplifier but for two channel listening too.

Of course, all the modern Dolby processing features are included  including Dolby True HD and Dolby Pro Logic IIz for more channels of amplification with the addition of height channels to immerse yourself in full home theater nirvana.

**[Denon AVR-4311 CI ][4]**

[<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3962" title="denon 4311 deal" alt="cheap denon 4311" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/denon4311.jpg" width="300" height="300" />][4]

One of  the very first things I noticed when I started to compare the Denon 4311 against the Denon 4810 and Denon even the Denon 5308, is that with this cheaper denon reciever when compared against the high end denon receivers is that you lose a  subwooffer channel with this model. While the others offer 9.3, this Denon stops at 9.2.

But with a suggested price of over $2000, and a **[street price much cheaper][4], **the 4311 is one of the newest higher end home theater receivers to be released to date  so far.

The 140 watts of power is the same as the 4810 offers, and the easy setup features and the  two remote controls make this the first real world receiver I could afford.  The others, while nice, would cost me as much as my entire home theater renovation would cost. I may be able to stretch my budget for the 4810, but with this being the Newer Denon receiver, it may be better if I buy this one, as it offers HDMI 1.4a, Automatic room correction for the best sound possible, and the discrete power section means there&#8217;s plenty of ooomph for my needs.

[**Denon AVR 3312CI**][5]

[<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3965" title="Denon 3312 cheap" alt="Denon 3312 deal" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Denon-3312.jpg" width="300" height="300" />][5]This is one of the most popular of all the Denon receivers in the 2012 Denon Receiver line, and**[ one of the more affordable][5]**, without sacrificing too many high end features that the pricier Denon receivers offer. For about $1000, you get a pretty good receiver with 7 channels of discrete power at 125 watts each, and all the modern technical stuff too.

As the photo shows, this Denon receiver only offer  one remote control, while the 4311 offers two. For my needs, this is not a big deal and I can live with one remote control if it means I save $1000 on a home theater receiver.

I still get the in command series, in fact this is the best in command receiver you can buy from Denon right now and the discrete amplifier design away from the processing mans not  only will two channel sound great, but home theater will come alive too with Audessy Multi HQ support that offers a more realistic profile for your high definition sound. The seven HDMI inputs are more than enough for me to get all my blu ray players and even cell phones connected too. This is definitely  a contender as I decide what home theater receiver I want to buy this year.

**[Denon AVR 2312CI ][6]**

[<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3968" title="Best Priced Denon Receiver" alt="Cheapest Denon amp. " src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Denon-2312.jpg" width="300" height="300" />][6]

The Denon 2312 is [**the first Denon receiver on sale in 2012 that is priced under $1000** ][6]and if you want to save $200 when you compare the 2312 to the 3312, then this might just be the best receiver to buy. I don&#8217;t know about you guys but I feel like I am just now getting into the real world pricing of home theater receivers. Let&#8217;s assume you make $50,000 a year. Do you really want to spend over one tenth of your salary on a home theater processor. That&#8217;s why I am starting to lean towards buying  the Denon 2312 &#8211; it&#8217;s a modern and affordable home theater reciever.

But just because we&#8217;re starting to hit the more affordable Denon AV Processors doesn&#8217;t mean that this is a high quality amplifer worthy of my attention.

I don&#8217;t know what speakers you need to drive with this amplifier but at 105 watts x 7, that&#8217;s enough and I don&#8217;t need, or have room for &#8211; a 9 channel setup  anyway.

Airplay, and modern HDMI specifications are far more important to me as I work more and more with digital data sources and less with analog. And at a price I could probably convince my wife to comply with, that alone may be the reason  I buy **[this particular Denon receiver][6]** over any other HT receiver by Denon.

**[Denon AVR 2112CI][7]**

[<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3971" title="Denon 2112" alt="Best Denon 2112 Price" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Denon-2112.jpg" width="300" height="300" />][7]

The Denon 2112 gets even cheaper still, and depending on your home theater needs might do just fine when it comes to  either buying your first home theater receiver, or if you are doing what I am needing to do, and that&#8217;s save for a newer model.  At a suggested price of $650 and [**priced even less** ][7]online, and is one to consider as we start to enter the  range of home theater receivers under $750.00.

The 2112 still comes packed with lots of power &#8211; 90 watts per channel x 7 and like all the 2012 Denon&#8217;s HDMI 1.4a is supported for all 3D formats and with six HDMI ports and support for online music whether through Airplay or streaming through  your iPod, iPad, iPod touch or even itunes &#8211;  the wireless support on the 2112 opens you up to the world of streaming music online.

And the networking compatibility of this home theater receiver from  Denon also includes the compatibility of streaming music from Pandora, or even viewing your flickr photos on the [big screen TV  ][8]in the comfort of your own home.

**[Denon AVR 1912][9]**

[<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3994" title="Cheap Denon 1912" alt="Best Price for Denon 1912" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Denon-19121.jpg" width="300" height="300" />][9]

The Denon AVR 1912 is getting real close to being the **[best home theater under $500][9]**, and as the year progresses I think we will see this happen. Currently, the MSRP on the 1912 is $549, so technically it&#8217;s the under $600 category but the price should drop on this some, as I am hoping to convince the wife that at only $500 we need this to enjoy our home theater even moreso than we are right now.

For just over $500, you get all the features of the big boys such as 7.1, Network Steraming (I think this feature is a must in 2012)  and full HDMI 1.4a support with six in and one out &#8211;  enough for most families just wanting to unwind after a day&#8217;s work. And with 90 watts x 7, for  a grand total of 360 watts of power.

If you have an iPad or IPod, you can even stream music to your Denon receiver straight from the  Apple Device &#8211; no wires needed.

**[Denon AVR 1712][10]**

[<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3995" title="Denon 1712 price" alt="usa denon receiver buys" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Denon-1712.jpg" width="300" height="300" />][10]Finally, I have found a cheaper home theater receiver from Denon that has a real world price of under $500 with a $399 retail price, and from what i can tell you don&#8217;t need to sacrifice a lot when it comes to features or amplification either. You have 90 watts x 7 and a setup wizard to help you get your home theater amplifier set up properly, the easy operation via the online graphical interface and 6 HDMI 1.4a inputs with one out will suit both the budget and the family room too.

All the high resolution audio  formats are supported too, like Dolby True  HD and DTS-HD  and  with an optional dock, you can connect your Apple iPod to this cheap Denon receiver too.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**[Denon AVR 1612][11]**

[<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3998" title="Denon 1612  on sale" alt="" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Denon-1612.jpg" width="300" height="300" />][11]

Priced at just $349.99, (**[even less at Amazon][11]**) the Denon 1612 is the best Denon receiver you can buy if you just want to run five channels for your home theater. For most of us, even a five channel home theater is more than enough for most rooms that double as a family and media room more than a dedicated HT..

But just because the 1612 from Denon comes with the capability of running just five speakers, does not mean that this is lacking  in the features you need for gaming, or TV and yes, even movie watching. The 75watts x 5, while a fraction of what the big Denon recievers cost, you have to remember that this receiver will cost less than the sales tax on the higher end  Denon receivers too.

The Denon 1612 still supports HDMI 1.4a format and with 4 HDMI ports for input and one HDMI port for output  this might be a great bargain on a home theater receiver from Denon.

[**Denon AVR 1312**][12]

&nbsp;

[<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4000" title="Denon1312" alt="" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Denon1312.jpg" width="300" height="300" />][12]

This is the cheapest Denon Reciever on sale in 2012 and the best bargain when it comes to buying  a cheap home theater receiver on sale. It&#8217;s one hundred dollar difference between the Denon 1612 and the Denon 1312 and for that hundred dollars you still get 5.1 output for speaker connections, HDMI 1.4a (4 inputs and out) and modern processing  such as

&nbsp;

**What Denon Receiver to Buy?**

For my needs, I need a 2012 model, and unless I get a deal on a**[ refurbished denon ][13], i will only consider models **ending in 12, so that knocks off the 5308 and Denon 4810 and even the Denon 4811 is now a year old, so those are out.

I then have to determine my needs and what I will be using the receiver for. If the cheap Denon 1312 will do the trick, I have no problem in saving money on a Denon AV receiver if the cheapo Denon&#8217;s will do the trick.  My movie and  TV watching are only a few hours a week, and  truth be told, I  didn&#8217;t  use most of the features of my high end Yamaha.

If  I do decide to buy a more expensive Denon receiver, I will probably go with the [**Denon 3312** ][5]as my big receiver from Denon. With a retail price of just over $1000,  this is a feature rich Denon receiver and probably about as high as I want to go when spending my hard earned money on an AV receiver this year. I have a hard time parting with more than one thousand dollars on any reciever or electronic device as these things depreciate pretty quick and when it&#8217;s time to resell or upgrade to the next latest receiver,  I hate to take too big a hit for the the pleasure any receiver  can provide, not  just from Denon.

I will tell you that regardless of what receiver for home theater I end up buying, I will **buy my Denon  from Amazon** as I find  they  have the best prices on Denon Receivers for both**[new Denon&#8217;s][14]**  and**[ refurbished Denon receivers in 2012][13]**.

   <B> <h1><a href="/2011/11/1-terabyte-external-hard-drive-prices-continue-to-drop/">1 Terabyte External Hard Drive Prices Continue To Drop</a></h1></B>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content">I&#8217;m old enough to remember when a 1GB hard drive was almost unthinkable, let alone a 1TB external hard drive, and now that 2TB and even 3 and 4GB hard drives come on to the market I thought I would take a look at some current real world street prices for a few external hard drives currently on sale:

&nbsp;

# [Toshiba Canvio Basics Portable Hard Drive 320 GB USB 2.0 External Hard Drive][1]

&nbsp;

Here&#8217;s an external hard drive from Toshiba that&#8217;s much cheaper than you could find for a 1TB model. Granted, it&#8217;s only 320GB compared to 1TB, but I could get my entire music collection on this hard drive and still have room left over. And the price can&#8217;t be beat for a small drive you can carry around with you that&#8217;s small enough to fit into your pocket or purse.



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# [Western Digital My Passport Essential SE 1 TB USB 3.0/2.0 Ultra Portable External Hard Drive][2]

&nbsp;

And if you do need more storage, the 1TB Western Digital Passport Essential Drive is one of the better deals for 1TB drives today. For a backup drive of  all your important files and the like, the price for this hard drive could be priceless. The fact that it&#8217;s on sale today is a bonus too.  


# [Western Digital WD Elements 2 TB USB 2.0 Desktop External Hard Drive][3]

This hard drive from Western Digital offers even more storage space and for the price (not the suggested price &#8211; the real price you pay online) it might be the best deal on big external hard drive today. 2TB holds a lot of files and movies and music.  


# [Seagate FreeAgent GoFlex Desk 3 TB USB 3.0 External Hard Drive][4]

With a big 3TB hard drive like the GoFlex Desk 3TB USB 3.0 External hard drive you get even more storage space for even less money. If a 1TB drive is going to cost about $100,for a few dollars more you can have 3x the hard drive space when you compare the two hard drives and the cost the 3TB is the best cost to hard drive space ratio.

# [Western Digital My Passport Essential 500 GB USB 3.0/2.0 Portable External Hard Drive][5]

Lastly, the 500GB option is great for small and portable storage requirements today and a fantastic way to extend the space of your desktop or notebook space requirements. That 80GB drive you have in your notebook doesn&#8217;t seem so big now and these hard drives are a great way to expand the space without breaking the bank and having to buy a brand new notebook just because you ran out of storage space.

   <B> <h1><a href="/2011/11/when-to-buy-an-imac-in-2012/">When To Buy an iMac in 2012?</a></h1></B>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content">First, I want to say that considering we are in the last bit of 2011 and the last iMac refresh was in May, (MacBook Pros for 2011 were just released in  October) I would **wait to [buy an iMac][1] right now **as there&#8217;s a very good chance we&#8217;ll see new iMacs models released  in 2012.

[<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4187" title="Should  I Buy an iMac Now?" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/41cC5NM63DL._SL500_AA300_.jpg" alt="Cheap iMac Deals" width="300" height="300" />][2]

**Is 2012 The  End of the iMac?**

Over the years, notebooks and now tablets have become increasingly popular so the one question I have to ask is will there even be an Apple  iMac  in 2012?  The iPad in a way has all but replaced the iMac except for two important options :

1. screen size. A 27 inch iPad would be pretty heavy  (and expensive)

2. Full size keyboard. You can&#8217;t touch type on a tablet. You could possibly connect a third party keyboard to an Apple iPad, but then you really have something that resembles a notebook or MacBook Air mor than a tablet.

I know that having a big screen can be more beneficial than having a faster processor (as I type this, I have 87% of my processor doing nothing at all) The iMac is/was a success due to the design over all else. That all in one design is attractive and cable free. This can&#8217;t be overlooked when marketing to the small office or home  computer crowd.

**Wait and See. **

As I write this,  the iMac has been a current model for over six months &#8211;  a lifetime when talking about computers. Apple&#8217;s release schedule  has been pretty much spot on the past  few years &#8211; new iMacs in early spring and maybe an iPad, early winter for  notebooks, and fall for the iPod and holiday shopping market.  I can see a  new iMac in about May 2012,  so  if you  can wait to buy a new Apple iMac,  I would  &#8211; if for no other reason to see what Apple does next.

Both the Apple iMac and MacBook Pro lines are in need of a makeover and Apple is rumored to make the MacBook Pro of 2012 more like the MacBook Air, and  the design on the  iMac has been the same for so long I wonder if Apple will release a brand new desktop computer in the summer of 2012?

Only time will tell of course, but I would think it  would be wise to hold off until summer 2012 if you can to  see what the new or replacement iMacs end up looking like. I think the wait will be worth it.

   <B> <h1><a href="/2011/11/should-i-upgrade-memory-on-my-macbook-pro/">Should I Upgrade Memory On My MacBook Pro?</a></h1></B>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content">Oh good grief, **[YES you should][1].  **

[<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4190" title="add ram to macbook pro " src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Screen-Shot-2012-03-13-at-2.45.56-PM.png" alt="cheap macbook pro memory" width="296" height="305" />][2]

I never really understood why this question even needed to be asked. I mean when you consider the price you pay for even the cheapest MacBook Pro and then compare the cost of a RAM upgrade it makes no sense to me why when you buy a MacBook Pro you wouldn&#8217;t increase the MacBook Pro&#8217;s ram at the same time.

**The Price of MacBook Pro Memory **

An example. Let&#8217;s say you&#8217;re waiting for the new MacBook Pro to be released but you can&#8217;t wait &#8211; you need to buy a MacBook Pro today, so you go shopping for a deal and [you find one][2].  You manage to [save almost $80 on a brand new Apple MacBook Pro][3]. This means that compared to walking into the  [Apple Store][4] you shopped online, found a better deal on a MacBook Pro than you could  have got from Apple and you probably even qualified for free shipping too.

This leaves you with $79.00 in savings to do what with? Buy RAM for your MacBook Pro ! At the time I write this it costs about  $40 or so for 8GB of RAM and if you shop around for 16GB  you can get that too for not much more. But, for  the sake of this article we&#8217;ll stick with the 8GB as this doubles your RAM without terminating  your warranty. Apple currently only supports 8GB of RAM on the  MBP&#8217;s so we&#8217;ll stop there for now.

This leaves you with another $30 to buy a MacBook Pro  stand or  a small MacBook Pro case for you  new laptop.

Oh, the bonus is that you **have  enough RAM to do  other stuff  with**. I&#8217;m writing  this on a [**2011 Apple Mac Mini** ][5] (a birthday pressent)  and the very first thing I did  was upgrade my RAM. I&#8217;ve got a few windows open and iTunes running and I am  using over the 4GB the Mac Mini already shipped with.

What  happens when you don&#8217;t have enough memory? You use swap disk space  which is exponentially  slower and slows your system down considerably   &#8211; so  much  so that any speed  benefit you thought you may  have by buying a fast MacBook Pro could be negated when the swap disk kicks in.

MacBook Pro ram is not the cheapest it&#8217;s ever been, but close (It was down close to $30 for 8GB earlier this year), but even at the slightly  higher ram prices for Apple MacBook Pro,  upgrading  the RAM is the biggest bargain in computing today.

Here&#8217;s a few ram prices  for you to check out:

		<div class="post-content">One of, if not the favorite companies I have come across in my efforts to move to the USA was to switch cellular providers from Rogers in Canada to Verizon in the USA  thanks to the possibility of their Canada Wireless plans that allow me to call both the US and Canada as if it  were one big country.

**About Verizon**

Verizon wireless is a pretty big wireless company and not only offers cellular service nationwide, they recently increased their customer base with the release and addition of the Apple iPhone 4  to compliment  the mostly  
Android based smartphone lineup.

This cellular company is also more than just about wireless products and services, but they also specialize in Cable TV,  Internet and landline phones for your  home or home office, and their business services cater to tools and services for all a business needs in 2012.

How are they able to grow and afford to offer all these products and services? Verizon is a public company with stocks traded on the stock market, which means either big gains in income or losses depending on the day or even time. How to you keep track of the stock prices? By checking what Verizon is currently being traded at

**Verizon Stock Checking **

Verizon&#8217;s stock symbol on the NYSE is **VZ, **a nice and short name that&#8217;s easy to remember. I have never bought or sold  stock in my life, so I will not lead you astray with my advice, but instead offer a few sites where you can check Verizon stock quotes (usually with a delay, and not real time stock prices for Verizon) and learn more about this publicly traded communications company.

Above are some websites you can refer to when checking stock prices at Verizon.

I&#8217;m still plunking away on my 2008 MacBook Pro and one thought I had to squeeze a few more months out of it until I saw what the 2012 MacBook Pro notebooks looked like would be to install a [MacBook Pro SSD drive][1] into this aging MacBook Pro of mine to squeeze a tad more life out of what I&#8217;ve already got and have paid for.

[**Best Selling 128GB MacBook Pro SSD Drives**][2]

A MacBook Pro SSD drive shouldn&#8217;t cost more than $200 or so and I&#8217;ve found that 128GB SSD&#8217;s are priced at about $200 which is the price point I want to be at. The 64GB SSD&#8217;s are the cheapest SSD drives for MacBook Pro you can buy but they&#8217;re not the largest and by the time you install an OS on them there&#8217;s not a lot of room left for my files and music.

Ultimately, I would love a 500GB SSD drive that would allow me enough room for my entire music collection to be stored on the SSD, but the costs for 500GB or even 250GB is still pretty pricey , especially considering I want to install an SSD in an older Mac, I don&#8217;t think this is the best money spent.

**Cheap MacBook Pro SSD Drives **

Not that I do a lot of shopping for computer upgrades, but when I  do the first place I check is at Amazon as I have found that for most items, whether it&#8217;s solid state drives for MacBook Pro or even a brand new MacBook Pro, it&#8217;s hard to beat them when it comes to price and the cheapest SSD drives for both Apple and PC are  on sale at Amazon for a much better price than anywhere else.

  <p class="wp-caption-text">
    Save on the Crucial 128GB SSD
  </p>
</div>

Take the Crucial 128GB M4 sSD drive. This drive is on sale at Amazon and cheaper than you can buy the exact same solid state drive at Crucial, and it&#8217;s also the best selling SSD drive del at Amazon.

[**Buy Crucial M4  128GB SSD MacBook Pro Drives on Sale at Amazon **][3]

There are other brands offering SSD&#8217;s for MacBook Pro  if Crucial doesn&#8217;t do it for you such as Kingston and Patriot offers ings and they may even be a few bucks cheaper than the Crucial Brand but over the years I have trusted the Crucial Brand when it comes to buying ram for MacBook Pro so I doubt I would have any problem when it comes to buying Crucial SSD&#8217;s on sale.

If you want to browse the best selling SSD drives you&#8217;re welcome to but I am going to buy a Crucial SSD for my MacBook Pro.
