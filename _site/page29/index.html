    <h1><a href="/2011/11/where-to-find-mobileme-login-information/">Where To Find MobileMe Login Information</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>MobileMe from Apple is Apple’s first (and in my opinion, failed) attempt at iCloud. The big feature of  MobileMe was email synchronization between your Apple iPhone, Mac, or even Windows PC, as well as being able to sync your photos from iPhoto, calendar from iCal and to sync any data from iDisk.</p>

<p>I never really used anything other than the email sycnhronization between my MacBook Pro and iPhone and even though it was expensive at $100/year for this service, it worked pretty well. and I never used the find my iphone service as I never did lose my iPhone. I did launder my iPhone at one point and the iPhone did not take to being washed and dryed too well. The only solution was to buy a new Apple iPhone.  Thankfully, my service provider in Canada (rogers) felt sorry for me and valued me as a customer and offered me a deal on a replacement iPhone as opposed to having to buy a replacement iphone at  full price.</p>

<p>Anway, back to the MobileME Login: One of the biggest advantages I found with mobileme email was that it allowed me to have access to my email anywhere I had access to a notebook (mac or pc, no difference)  where I could login and read and reply to my email on a more comfortable computing environment. Yes, I could have used my iPhone but sometimes I travel to the US and the data charges for using your iPhone in the USA are astronomical and this is where the value of mobileme  really shone as it allowed me to still check my email while away.</p>

<p>To login to your mobile me account, all you really need to do is <a href="http://me.com">visit me.com</a> or <a href="http://mobileme.com">mobileme.com</a> and enter your username and password. With the announcement of iCloud, the end is near for mobile me as iCloud from Apple seems to be a better product than what Mobile Me ever was. The folks at Apple extended my mobileme membership for  well into next year – a nice gesture considering I was paying $100 a year for their service.</p>

<p>Mobile Me reviews stated that this could have been a much better service, and I think with iCloud Apple got it even better but if you just need a way to sync your email from your mobileme account to your phone I found the Mobile Me service worked pretty well for me and to me it was worth the 8 bucks or so a month to have email on my iPhone and my Mac fully synchronized.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2011/11/where-to-find-hotmail-messenger-download/">Where To Find HotMail Messenger Download</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>As I wrote about earlier, I’m not much of a fan of  hotmail products and prefer to use the Google products instead such as Gmial and even Skype for chatting as I can make phone calls too, but with very big market using the Windows OS I want to take a moment and explore the Hotmail Messenger for 2011 as its’ been some time since I’ve had an opportunity to do so.</p>

<p><strong>HotMail Messenger is actually MSN Messenger</strong></p>

<p>I missed this news, but it seems to me that somewhere along the line hotmail got sold to microsoft so now there really is no hotmail messenger software you can download but you need to download MSN messenger instead, which is probably a big plus for users as the MSN brand is much much bigger than hotmail will be in 2011.</p>

<p>MSN Hotmail Messenger pretty much changes the game and you can choose to downoload MSN messenger or if you prefer, use skype. I use skype because the people I choose to connect with also us this software so I don’t  really  have much of  a need for MSN messenger.</p>

<p>But, you can never learn too much about any subject I find so let’s have a look at MSN messenger and have a look at the main features it provides. One thing I have found is that MSN messenger for windows is leaps and bounds better than MSN messenger for Mac with the windows version offering the features I wanted and  needed, but on the Mac, not so much.</p>

<p>The folks at microsoft offer a 40% discount on a high definition video camera that allows you to make HD video calls. You may want to also check Amazon for web cameras as I have found they offer the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;ref_=nb_sb_ss_sc_0_7&amp;field-keywords=hd%20webcam&amp;url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;sprefix=hd%20web%20&amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">best prices on HD web cameras</a> too.</p>

<p>You can also connect your MSN messenger  account with your facebook account too so you can chat with your facebook friends by using MSN messenger instead of using the facebook chat feature.</p>

<p>Windows Phones come with with MSN messenger pre-installed of course, so you can use your smartphone to chat with friends and  family too, and if you have an android smartphone you can download and install a MSN messenger chat. It should come as no surprise that there’s no  Apple iPhone MSN messenger app available on the MSN site, at least officially that I am aware of.</p>

<p>Overall, the <a href="http://explore.live.com/messenger">MSN messenger download</a> looks like a great way to connect with friends and family in 2011.</p>

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>Guess what 123 inkjets sells? You got it  – Printer Ink and Toner! and according to them you can <a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-1548159-10471664">save up to 76 percent on ink and toners supplies</a> compared to what you would pay for the name brand inkjet refills, which can be sometimes worth more than the printer they were designed for.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-1548159-10471664"><br />
<img class="alignleft" style="border-style: initial; border-color: initial; border-image: initial; border-width: 0px;" src="http://www.awltovhc.com/image-1548159-10471664" alt="123inkjets.com - Printer Ink, Toner, &amp; More!" width="300" height="250" border="0" /></a></p>

<p>I have never had good luck with printers,  and the more I think of it the more frustrated I get. Ink for your printer is kindof like gas for the car. If you don’t have ink the printer won’t run  and if you’re like me you wait until the last second to get new ink for your printer and you end up paying full retail price.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>With Age, Comes Wisdom</strong></p>

<p>But, the older  I get the more I begin to value preventive more than reactive when it comes to solving problems and the one problem you can solve quite easily is to be sure you’ve got enough ink ahead of time. But who want’s to pay full load for printer ink so you can stick it in the drawer? You’re much better off to be prepared and one way for that to happen and  save money on printer ink is to buy your ink ahead of time – whether you’re in charge of and entire offices’ full of office supplies or, like yours truly you just work out of a small office this advice still holds true.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002XISVVC/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002XISVVC"><img class="size-full wp-image-4301 alignleft" title="The Epson NX510 has been a good printer" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Screen-Shot-2012-05-08-at-11.05.31-AM.png" alt="Epson printer ink coupons" width="308" height="241" /></a></p>

<div>
  <span style="color: #0000ee;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br /> </span></span><strong>How much can you save on printer ink? </strong>My little epson inkjet is one of the first printers I have had that actually does what it&#8217;s supposed to do and just print and copy when you need it. It&#8217;s a good little printer. But to buy ink directly from Epson will cost me about $38.00 and yet if I buy the compatible ink from 123 inkjets I&#8217;ll spend more in initial outlay, but I get 14 ink jet cartridges for just $79.00. That&#8217;s double  the savings and I never have to worry about ink for my printer for some time. I&#8217;m not a heavy printer user so I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if I got a year or more out of my printer ink purchase.

    <h1><a href="/2011/11/itunes-download-help/">iTunes Download Help</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>Apple iTunes is one of the last Apple Applications I use as I find it much easier to work with a soundtrack playing to help me get my work done faster than if I had to work in silence, and  I also am able to rent movies with Apple iTunes too, all by downloading free software from Apple that allows me to listen to my music, find new music and movies ( I’m not much interested in TV shows from Apple, but they are available) and the best part is that the iTunes download is free.</p>

<p><strong>Almost Free iTunes Software</strong></p>

<p>There’s no such thing as free most times and you usually have to exchange some sort of value to <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/download/">get your free Apple iTunes download</a> and before you can start to download the free Apple software you’re required to do two things: you have to provide Apple with your email address and what country you are in as well. In my case, this means my country options are Canada and either english or french, and there’s also two check boxes asking  you if  you would like to receive the new on itunes newsletter that from what I can gather comes out weekly, and also whether you want to be kept up to date on all the other Apple news on Apple products in addition to the emails about what’s on sale at the iTunes store.</p>

<p>If you’re unsure Apple answers your questions on why you may want to receive all this stuff. I have found that Apple is pretty good with emails and only sends a handful of emails over the year about new products and as a fan of Apple computer I like to know what’s up anyway so  I leave the default as checked and enter my email address.</p>

<p>Once I have made my deal with Apple I am now able to download Apple iTunes for free  and install it on my Mac or PC with ease and start to add music to my library if this is a brand new Apple iTunes install or if it’s an Apple iTunes upgrade I can start to enjoy the benefits and security updates the new iTunes software download offers.</p>

<p>Downloading Apple iTunes is pretty easy and safe. You do have to surrender your email address to get the free iTunes software but I feel that’s a fair price for the value offered by Apple’s iTunes software.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2011/11/who-has-the-best-memory-compatibility-checker/">Best Memory Compatibility Checker Helps you Buy RAM</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>One of the very first questions you need to ask when shopping for a new computer is what type of ram do I need? And the second being what type of ram does my computer need and once you have this data you can go shopping for ram online and get the best price on your computer memory upgrade. The Best Memory Compatibility Checker can help you do this easily.</p>

<p>But what if all you know is your computer name? Or, for a lot of computer models the computer name is a long line of numbers that doesn’t exactly roll off the tip of your tongue with ease. An example might be the computer I am using to type this article with: an Acer <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005GSK6BY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B005GSK6BY">Aspire 5552-7474</a>. This is a pretty long name for a computer when you compare it to a more palatable name like Apple iMac, and it’s hard to figure out what RAM you need for both computers.</p>

<p>With the cheap Acer, you have to be sure you buy the ram for that specific computer as Acer makes many notebook computers from the smallest netbook computer to the the fastest, you need to be sure you install the right RAM for you PC, because it’s possible  to fry your computer if  you install the wrong ram into your notebook or desktop.</p>

<p>With the Apple iMac, in 2011 there’s 5 different Apple iMac models, and who knows what a 2012 Apple iMac will bring and how many models that Apple will release next year. You need to be sure, again, that you buy the  right ram for your Apple iMac  as all iMac memory does not  work in all computers.</p>

<p><strong>Check Your Memory Upgrades Before You Buy</strong></p>

<p>One of the best ways to be absolutely certain you get the right ram for your Mac or PC every time is to use a memory configurator of some sort to assist you in buying the right ram for your PC and these sometimes can be called Memory Compatibility Checker or some other name like memory finder tool or ram search, or  if you already know the RAM you need than you can just shop by type. If you know  you need to buy DDR3 1333Mhz sodimms for your  notebook, many memory stores list the RAM by memory  speed which makes it easy to buy ram.</p>

<p>One of the better ram checkers or tools to use is from <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">Crucial technology</a> as this memory store not only offers  a memory checker for every computer ever introduced,  they offer a gaurantee  that the memory you buy for your computer will work with your PC, which is something a lot of other computer memory stores don’t offer. They will happily sell you ram, but you should be sure to get the best deal by confirming the ram is indeed the right ram for your computer.</p>

<p>Regardless of what memory store you buy RAM from, the use of a Memory Compatibility Checker is a fantastic tool to get the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">best ram at the best price every time</a>.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2011/11/how-i-fixed-my-hotmail-signin-problems/">How I Fixed My HotMail Signin Problems</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>One of the biggest problems I have this year is being able to manage my email for all email addresses I have in one simple email mailbox. For the longest time,  I was using Apple Mail for my email as I was drinking the Apple Kool Aid full force and used not only Apple products exclusively but also relied on Apple mail servers to deliver email through my .me email account.</p>

<p>But this need for Apple as my default email addresses have changed and I find myself looking for other email alternatives, and one of the solutions I had used many years ago was for hotmail as my email address. The problem was I forgot both my hotmail username and password as the last time I had used hotmail was years ago – before hotmail became a microsoft product and was still a seperate and one of the first to offer free email for everybody.</p>

<p>I tried a few different usernames I thought I may have used by then as the username you pick in your 20’s tend to be an entirely username  you pick in your 40’s – at least I tend to feel that way. I’ve grown up some. But they all didn’t work as now Microsoft is asking for my Window Live ID which I have no idea on how to find as I’ve been a true blue Mac user.</p>

<p>At first I tried to use what  I thought might be a reasonable username for Hotmail, but nope, no luck. I tried to use the ‘forgot your password’ feature that is offered at the hotmail sign up page but I guess my hotmail account didn’t transfer  over either from being a dormant email account for so long or that when MS bought hotmail they weeded me out. Either way, I was screwed when it came to logging into my old hotmail account, so after a while I just decided  to not bother signing up for hotmail at all, as I already have a .me and gmail account.</p>

<p>What I ended up doing was to forward all my email to Google  Gmail as I find that Gmail has an outstanding spam filter. The Apple Mail also offers a spam filter too but I didn’t feel it was doing a good job.  And, I recently switched smartphones from an Apple iPhone to a Motorola Droid 3 and again  – I felt the Gmail was doing a better job than than the Mobile Me  on the Android platform so I made  the switch to Gmail and never looked back.</p>

<p>To be fair to the Apple Mail I have yet to switch over to the Apple Cloud as I find myself relying less and less on Apple products over the past year and I feel that competitors are offering much more value in 2011. Apple does still make some outstanding products no doubt about that but I’m becoming less and less willing to pay the premium Apple demands.</p>

<p>I ended up fixing my hotmail signin  problem by just giving up and using a competitor’s product instead that allowed me to login easier than I could with what is now, Microsoft Hotmail.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2011/11/sennheiser-hd-25-1-headphone-review/">Sennheiser HD 25-1 Headphone Review</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content">I have owned these Sennheiser headphones for more than five years now, but only recently have they seen any real great use from me but I thought hey, I may as well write a quick review on these as they have withstood the test of  time, and  as I see when I check prices for Sennheiser headphones, <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TDZOXG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000TDZOXG">they sure have come down in price too</a></strong>.

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TDZOXG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000TDZOXG"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4291" title="sennheiser hd-25 review" alt="best price on HD-25's" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/JIM_33701-600x398.jpg" width="600" height="398" /></a>

<em>The HD-25' are  a pretty sweet sounding headphone for the money. </em>

When I first bought these, I paid way more money than what you can get these great headphones for now, as I paid over $400 and now with a bit of shopping for some of the better deals on headphones you can get  a much better price.

These are closed back headphones, and except for using apple earbuds or my favorite earbud headphones - the <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004RE5ZCI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004RE5ZCI">Sony MDR EX 310LP</a>, </strong>so I can't compare how they sound  to  open backed headphones like the HD600 or HD650, but I can guess the sound signature would be similar across the sennheiser line for 2012.

<strong>How Do They Sound?</strong>

Oh, boy. Reviewing audio equipment is much trickier than say <a href="http://www.dcresource.com">digital camera reviews </a>where you can take photos and  compare. the output.

Audio is so subjective anyway. My wife loves bass and top 40 hits, while to my brother in law prefers more treble. So, unlike audio magazines I won't  glow about these phones and  how they changed my life with their detailed highs and deep bass because everybody has a preference.  To me, they sound pretty good. I can wear them for hours without fatigue and they have no problem with music from a high end  audio rig or just an iPod or iPad.

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4290" title="Sennheiser HD 25-1" alt="cheap sennheiser HD 25-1" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/JIM_3371-600x398.jpg" width="600" height="398" />

Truth be told, I'm not an expert  on music , but I know what I like and these little senny's  are really  a good headphone and  though I  haven't heard the beats line of products from Monster, I could hazard a good guess that these would offer much more value.

<strong>Not Noise Canceling, But Close</strong>

One of the reasons these little headphones are so good is due to their design. The closed back means you don't have a lot of sound leakage when wearing these  - either noise going out or in, and this allows you to immerse yourself  in what's important and that's the music. I never got the idea of noise canceling  headphones that tended to add noise instead of just blocking  out the outside noise in the first place.

But you're not entirely shut off from the world when listening to these headphones, meaning you can still be aware  of  your surroundings. Perhaps due to lifestyle mostly (I'm an old guy and stay inside)  I tend to use these in and ar0und  the house as opposed to using  them  as street headphones. On the rare occasions I do need headphones outside, I tend to use the Sony earbuds.

<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/JIM_3369.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4288" title="Sennheiser headphones on sale" alt="Beats or Sennheiser?" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/JIM_3369-600x398.jpg" width="600" height="398" /></a>

<em>The senny's are detailed and offer a realistic and  neutral sound that doesn't flavor the recordings </em>

<strong>Comfortable Headphones </strong>

I have two confessions to make when it coms to these headphones - the very first was that at first they were the most uncomfortable phones I have ever used, but then I realized two things: I have a pretty big head which isn't helping matters any and the second thing is  that  I didn't  realize until very recently that you could seperate the headband for a better fit. This is one of those times that reading the manual would  help. I found that by leaving the headphones over the back of my couch for a few hours fixed the problem of the headphones being too tight.

Also, because I wear glasses - the phones are on hear headphones  and not over the ear, so there's pressure on your ears which in turn was pressing on the arms of my glasses and that was uncomfortable to say the least. If I adjust the glasses on my head so there's less pressure on the glasses frames I fare much better and can listen for a few hours every listening  session.

<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/JIM_3368.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4287" title="Sennheiser hd-25 prices" alt="best prices for sennheiser headphones. " src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/JIM_3368-600x398.jpg" width="600" height="398" /></a>

<strong>Summary </strong>

These are lightweight headphones at just over 5 oz, so I find them to be light, comfortable, and precise and neutral when it comes to sound, that I like. I've never had to, but you can replace the earpads and replace the cable with an audiophile cable if you wan't  to customize the HD-25's further.  If there's one qualm I do have is that the cable connection to the  phones can get loose and I'm down to just one channel instead of stereo headphone listening. A wiggle  of the red connector fixes this with ease and this does not happen often enough to be a problem .

<strong>Where To Buy Sennheiser HD 25  for  the Lowest Price.</strong>

I have found that despite shopping elsewhere <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TDZOXG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000TDZOXG">Amazon is the best price on these headphones</a> </strong>than any other store and they're now on sale for much less.

I have owned these Sennheiser headphones for more than five years now, but only recently have they seen any real great use from me but I thought hey, I may as well write a quick review on these as they have withstood the test of  time, and  as I see when I check prices for Sennheiser headphones, <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TDZOXG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000TDZOXG">they sure have come down in price too</a></strong>.

<em>The HD-25' are  a pretty sweet sounding headphone for the money. </em>

When I first bought these, I paid way more money than what you can get these great headphones for now, as I paid over $400 and now with a bit of shopping for some of the better deals on headphones you can get  a much better price.

These are closed back headphones, and except for using apple earbuds or my favorite earbud headphones - the <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004RE5ZCI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004RE5ZCI">Sony MDR EX 310LP</a>, </strong>so I can't compare how they sound  to  open backed headphones like the HD600 or HD650, but I can guess the sound signature would be similar across the sennheiser line for 2012.

<strong>How Do They Sound?</strong>

Oh, boy. Reviewing audio equipment is much trickier than say <a href="http://www.dcresource.com">digital camera reviews </a>where you can take photos and  compare. the output.

Audio is so subjective anyway. My wife loves bass and top 40 hits, while to my brother in law prefers more treble. So, unlike audio magazines I won't  glow about these phones and  how they changed my life with their detailed highs and deep bass because everybody has a preference.  To me, they sound pretty good. I can wear them for hours without fatigue and they have no problem with music from a high end  audio rig or just an iPod or iPad.

Truth be told, I'm not an expert  on music , but I know what I like and these little senny's  are really  a good headphone and  though I  haven't heard the beats line of products from Monster, I could hazard a good guess that these would offer much more value.

<strong>Not Noise Canceling, But Close</strong>

One of the reasons these little headphones are so good is due to their design. The closed back means you don't have a lot of sound leakage when wearing these  - either noise going out or in, and this allows you to immerse yourself  in what's important and that's the music. I never got the idea of noise canceling  headphones that tended to add noise instead of just blocking  out the outside noise in the first place.

But you're not entirely shut off from the world when listening to these headphones, meaning you can still be aware  of  your surroundings. Perhaps due to lifestyle mostly (I'm an old guy and stay inside)  I tend to use these in and ar0und  the house as opposed to using  them  as street headphones. On the rare occasions I do need headphones outside, I tend to use the Sony earbuds.

<em>The senny's are detailed and offer a realistic and  neutral sound that doesn't flavor the recordings </em>

<strong>Comfortable Headphones </strong>

I have two confessions to make when it coms to these headphones - the very first was that at first they were the most uncomfortable phones I have ever used, but then I realized two things: I have a pretty big head which isn't helping matters any and the second thing is  that  I didn't  realize until very recently that you could seperate the headband for a better fit. This is one of those times that reading the manual would  help. I found that by leaving the headphones over the back of my couch for a few hours fixed the problem of the headphones being too tight.

Also, because I wear glasses - the phones are on hear headphones  and not over the ear, so there's pressure on your ears which in turn was pressing on the arms of my glasses and that was uncomfortable to say the least. If I adjust the glasses on my head so there's less pressure on the glasses frames I fare much better and can listen for a few hours every listening  session.

<strong>Summary </strong>

These are lightweight headphones at just over 5 oz, so I find them to be light, comfortable, and precise and neutral when it comes to sound, that I like. I've never had to, but you can replace the earpads and replace the cable with an audiophile cable if you wan't  to customize the HD-25's further.  If there's one qualm I do have is that the cable connection to the  phones can get loose and I'm down to just one channel instead of stereo headphone listening. A wiggle  of the red connector fixes this with ease and this does not happen often enough to be a problem .

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004YLCLM6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B004YLCLM6"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2618" title="How about  a Mac Mini?" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screen-Shot-2011-07-28-at-1.32.41-PM.png" alt="Cheapest Mac Mini Needs RAM" width="265" height="159" /></a></p>

<p>The Apple Mac mini was an innovative attempt to tap into the consumer market with an entry level Mac desktop computer. The Mac mini is remarkable for its small size as well as the fact that it comes with no display, keyboard or mouse—and after its initial introduction, no built in optical drive. Apple promoted this as BYOKDM (aka “Bring Your Own…” and was aimed at users who might already have these compatible peripherals to justify the lower cost.</p>

<p>The original Mac Mini did not include a server version but did have an optical drive. Going forward from the first Mac mini revision in the summer of 2010, all versions of the mini included the server version as part of the Mac OS X operating system, the 2011 configurations eliminated the optical drive.</p>

<p>The Apple Mac mini Intel Core i5 2.5 GHz features the aluminum unibody design that replaced the original chassis which featured a polycarbonate top and bottom panels on the aluminum case. The unit measures 7.7 inches (19.7 cm) square and 1.4 inches (3.6 cm) tall. It weighs 2.7 pounds (1.22 kg). The processor that shipped with the computer was a 2.5GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 with 3MB on-chip shared L3 cache, custom configurable to 2.7GHz dual-core Intel Core i7.</p>

<p><strong>Apple Mac Mini Intel Core i5 features:</strong></p>

<p>The Apple iMac 2.7GHz Intel Quad-core i5 was first introduced in May 2011 and represented a higher end version of its co-release the iMac 2.5 Quad-core i5.  The 2.7GHz   differed mainly in processing speed, display resolution, and storage capacity on the hard drive.</p>
