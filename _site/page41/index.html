   <B> <h1><a href="/2011/03/how-much-memory-will-a-macbook-pro-recognize/">How Much Memory Will A MacBook Pro Recognize?</a></h1></B>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>Memory upgrades for the Apple MacBook Pro now ship in three different ram types for the MacBook Pro and depending on the specific Apple Mac Pro you have and are wanting to or needing to add ram upgrades to  – the answer will be different. The short answer  to your question **How Much Memory Will a MacBook Pro Recognize? **is that it depends on what Apple MacBook Pro you are needing to max out with Apple memory.</p>

<p><strong>PC2 5300 DDR2 MacBook Pro RAM Upgrades</strong></p>

<p>MacBook Pro RAM over the years has shipped in various speeds and memory sizes with the first MacBook Pros only being able to recognize 2GB of RAM. I’m not going to list all the different MacBook Pro models that maxed out at 2GB, but let’s say if your MacBook Pro is 3 years old or  older there’s a good chance that the MacBook Pro 2GB maximum Applied.</p>

<p><strong>PC3 1066 DDR3 MacBook Pro RAM Upgrades</strong></p>

<p>Then in oh, about  2008 the MacBook Pros made out of aluminum showed up on the scene and with the faster processors, these MBP’s also required different RAM than the older MacBook Pro models did as DDR3 1066 SDRAM sodimms became the standard memory upgrades for the MacBook Pro  and with them came the ability to accept 4GB of RAM –  a big bump as now the MacBook Pros could accept 4GB of RAM in the form of 2x2gB memory upgrade modules.  In 2009, the MacBook Pros could accept 8GB of RAM which was really a a big deal, but so was the price – when you could first install 8GB into a MacBook Pro, the cost was almost one thousand dollars, which was the same as or close to the cost of the MacBook  Pro. Thankfully  ram prices for MacBook Pros  have dropped considerably and for most MBP’s that will accept 8GB of RAM you can now max out your MacBook Pro for under $100 from most memory vendors.</p>

<p><strong>PC3 1333 DDR3 MacBook Pro RAM Upgrades</strong></p>

<p>In 2011, – last month to be exact – Apple has released the latest and best MacBook Pros to date with faster processors, longer battery life and… <strong>the same 8GB of RAM</strong> as the previous models. This is a disappointment  as the rumor sites were sure we’d  see the latest MacBook Pros to support 16GB of RAM. But last week, OWC announced that they have tested and  approved for sale 16GB RAM for MacBook Pro models  in 2011. But these are the <strong>most expensive ram upgrades for MacBook Pro</strong> I have ever seen and at the time I write this will cost you more than the MacBook Pro you will want to ugprade.</p>

<p>[table id=15 /]</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="buying macbook RAM">Buying MacBook Pro RAM</a></strong></p>

<p>Once you have determined what MacBook Pro you have, which can be tricky –  but one way is to just go to the apple menu  and  select about this Mac, which at very least will show you what kind or speed of RAM you need which helps you narrow down the above 3 choices for MacBook Pro RAM  from 3 different ram types to three.  An example would be in my case, I’m typing this on a 2008 Apple MacBook Pro which shows I have the maximum  4GB of MacBook RAM installed:</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  As you can see, my particular Apple MacBook Model uses 1066MHz RAM. The system runs the DDR3 1066MHz RAM at 1066.6 MHz, and thus the memory speed is reported as 1067MHz, instead of 1066MHz, but make no mistake you need to buy DDR3 SDRAM RAM upgrades if your MacBook reads the memory speed as 1067MHz.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Once you&#8217;ve nailed down what RAM upgrades you need to buy for the MacBook Pro, the next step is for you to choose whether you want to buy the cheapest MacBook  RAM you can find, or if you choose to buy name brand RAM such as Crucial Memory, which offer both a name brand product but also support as well that&#8217;s top notch too.  On a related note,  I got asked the other day if <a href="http://www.macmemorystore.com" rel="nofollow">Mac Memory Store</a> is any good?
</p>

<p>and my answer is, I don’t know. I have never bought RAM or dealt with them in any way. One way to check if a memory vendor is any good is to <a href="http://www.resellerratings.com">check the ratings they receive online</a>, but this isn’t always a good way to buy RAM either as people tend to complain far more than compliment so the results are weighted and usually for the worst. I can only recommend the best RAM Brands I can trust, and over the years have bought memory from myself, and I suggest you do the same if you’re looking to maximize your MacBook RAM but minimize the grief and trouble from dealing with unknown memory stores.</p>

<p>**2010 Apple Mac Mini Memory<br />
**[table id=5 /]</p>

<p>Mac Mini memory for the 2011 (well, OK..the 2010 Mac Mini as that’s the last time we’ve seen an Apple Mac Mini refresh) is sold either in <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/Mac_Mini_(1066_DDR3)/">individual memory modules</a> or as Apple <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/Mac_Mini_KITS_(1066_DDR3)/">Mac Mini memory upgrade kits</a> and with those two pages you should be able to, without much trouble find the best deal on Mac Mini RAM for your new Mac Mini.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013FK9U2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0013FK9U2"><img class="size-full wp-image-1052 alignnone" title="Cheapest Mac Mini" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-14-at-10.51.55-AM.png" alt="Best Deal Mac Mini" width="283" height="168" /></a></p>

<p>**<br />
**</p>

<p>Regardless whether you plan to use the Mac Mini as just the <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26x%3D0%26ref_%3Dnb_sb_noss%26y%3D0%26field-keywords%3Dmac%2520mini%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">cheapest Apple computer you can buy</a></strong> today or if you plan on using the Apple Mac Mini as a fileserver for videos, photos or movies the Mac Mini will run faster, smoother and perform better overall with more RAM.</p>

<p>Thanks to the latest Mac Mini redesign which allows you to upgrade the Mac Mini RAM yourself without the added expense and hassle of having to have an Apple authorized dealer perform the ram upgrade for you, even if you are on the strictest budget you should upgrade the RAM to the maximum ram possible for one reason:</p>

<p><strong>Mac Mini RAM is Cheap!</strong></p>

<p><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">But, hey don’t just take my word for it – check out the lowest prices on Mac Mini memory upgrades: </span></strong></p>

<p>I won’t talk about individual Mac Mini prices but as you can see from the chart above, it’s not to hard to max out your Mac Mini for less than $100 from a selection of high quality RAM stores, as that’s the only memory store I will work with – the guys you can trust to ship and sell you the best Mac Mini RAM at the best price they can and back it up with a warranty. There’s a list of the best memory stores in the top right corner where you can <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/">buy Mac RAM cheap</a>.</p>

<p>When you’ve decided that you do need to ugprade the RAM on your Mac Mini, and you’ve bought it online and are ready to replace your old Mac Mini RAM the next step is to figure out how to do this Mac Mini memory upgrade yourself because for the first time since the Apple Mac Mini was introduced – <strong>you can upgrade the Mac Mini RAM yourself</strong></p>

<p>In fact, the Mac Mini RAM Upgrade has to be one of the easiest Apple computers to upgrade and Apple even supplies you with instructions on <a href="http://manuals.info.apple.com/en_US/Mac_mini_Mid2010_User_Guide.pdf">how to boost the Mac Mini 2010 Memory</a></p>

<p>You can install up to 8GB of RAM in the 2010 Mac Mini in the two memory upgrade slots that are available, meaning you will have to buy 4GB RAM modules that are DDR3 SDRAM running at 1066MHz in a a 240 pin sodimm configuration. This is the exact same memory that’s used in the Apple iMacs, MacBook and MacBook Pros from 2010 as well. (The newest iMacs released last summer use DDR3 RAM which won’t work)</p>

<p>There are loads of <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">memory stores</a> that will sell you <strong>RAM cheap for the Mac Mini</strong> but 8GB upgrade kits for the Mac Mini should be priced under $100 from most memory upgrade vendors online today.</p>

<p>Now that Apple does not require you to open the Mac Min by voiding your warranty, the new 2010 Mac Mini is way easier to upgrade the memory on and I suggest you Max out the RAM on your Mac Mini for the <a>fastest Mac Mini you can buy</a> in 2011.</p>

   <B> <h1><a href="/2011/03/dell-hp-sony-best-prices-on-computer-ram/">Best Prices on Computer RAM</a></h1></B>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>But for the most of you, when you are in the market for <a href="http://www.knockoutprices.com">best prices of any kind</a> and for any product – not just computer memory upgrades, the term <strong>best equals cheapest price</strong> and when it comes down to best computer memory upgrade prices for your Apple, HP, Sony or Dell computer, to name a few popular brands.</p>

<p>The kicker is the word ‘<strong>best</strong>‘. For some, this the word best means cheapest computer ram, for others the word best might mean best computer support and for the last bunch it could all be about the best computer ram brands that is most important.The <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/">Best Prices on Computer RAM</a></strong> is the one of the questions I get asked and I answer every day.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001KB6Z2U/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001KB6Z2U&quot;&gt;Best Selling Computer RAM"><br />
<strong>Best Selling Computer RAM</strong></a></p>

<p>This means that with a few rare exceptions you will be in the market for generic RAM if price is king when it comes to shopping for RAM and you need to buy memory for your new computer. Sometimes, you can get lucky and pick up name brand RAM from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26x%3D0%26ref_%3Dnb_sb_noss%26y%3D0%26field-keywords%3Dkingston%2520ram%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">Kingston</a> or <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">Crucial</a> cheaper than the no name RAM but for most applications generic RAM is where you should be shopping for.</p>

<p>Lucky for you I track and monitor the best, or <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com">cheapest RAM prices</a></strong> for Apple but also PC manufacturers such as Sony, Dell, HP and Toshiba to name a few of the best selling PC manufacturers.</p>

<p>When shopping for the best computer ram prices or even hard drives too – all you need to do is visit a few websites and write down the price you see on the site of the memory store.</p>

<p>For example, if you need to <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/imac">buy iMac RAM</a> for a 2010 summer Apple iMac, the generic RAM is going to be much cheaper deal than if you had bought the RAM from Apple, which tends to ship their Macs with Samsung or Micron RAM upgrades, which are both name brand memory and not the cheaper ram that you want to buy. Apple, Dell and all charge a lot for RAM because they can. It’s assumed by a lot of consumers that because they make the computer they must be the best place to buy RAM too, and that’s not always the case.</p>

<p>You should always shop online and do a bit of research when ram shopping. Some memory stores not only offer free shipping, but some have limited time deals on memory and offer deals and discounts on your RAM purchase too. You can also use competitor’s pricing to see if you can get a better deal on RAM than the listed price, especially if you are buying RAM upgrades in bulk for your office or school needs where you plan to upgrade more than one PC at a time.</p>

<p>The one disadvantage to buying cheap RAM is that there is no brand associated with the memory. This can be a good thing as you’re not paying for the brand, and just the memory upgrade itself but where you could find problems with the best RAM is with customer support as quite a few memory ‘stores’ are just that when it comes to generic RAM. They buy the memory upgrades in bulk, test the RAM and compete on price alone for the cheapest RAM you can buy. This could be a problem if the memory store is less than reputable so it’s a good idea to check the ratings of the store you buy ram in the rare instance that you do have issues with the cheap ram you buy.</p>

<p>If you take your time and <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/where-to-buy-computer-memory-upgrades/">buy memory from a store you can trust</a> at a price you can afford, you will not only enjoy the savings benefit of <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/">buying the best RAM</a> but also know that in the rare case you do have memory problems, the memory store you buy from will be there with the memory help and support you need.</p>

<p>Flash Memory is the future. We’re already seeing it in smaller capacities and there’s a good chance you have a USB stick or flash drive or thumb drive or whatever you want to call them on your keychain, desktop drawer or in your pocket.</p>

<p>Flash Memory is also becoming more popular in consumer electronics such as tablet computers like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26x%3D0%26ref_%3Dnb_sb_noss%26y%3D0%26field-keywords%3Dipad%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">Apple iPad</a>, smartphones such as the Apple iPhone and other smart phones running the Android operating system and even the<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26x%3D0%26ref_%3Dnb_sb_noss%26y%3D0%26field-keywords%3Dipod%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957"> best selling Apple iPod line </a>relies on solid state flash memory to operate.</p>

<p>Until recently, solid state hard drives were very small in size or extremely expensive but just as <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/trending-ram-prices/">ram prices keep dropping </a>over time the SSD hard drives have also dropped making it quite possible and somewhat affordable to replace your notebook hard drive entirely with a SSD hard drive which offers much faster, and in some cases instant responsiveness. Startup times or how long it takes to wake your notebook from sleep are much faster with a SSD hard drive or flash based hard drive.</p>

<p>**Crucial SSD Hard Drive Sizes and Prices<br />
**</p>

<p>Many new notebook manufacturers such as Apple now offer the ability to upgrade the traditional hard drive technology to SSD drives at checkout when ordering a new notebook online, but you may be able to buy a SSD hard drive directly and upgrade you notebook hard drive yourself.</p>

<p>One company known for both digital camera memory as well as desktop and notebook memory and is a well known brand for ram upgrades has been offering SSD hard drives for sale for some time now, but only recently have the Crucial SSD drives been affordable where the cost does not outweigh the benefit of the added speed and reliability thanks to the fact that with a Crucial SSD drive there are no moving parts as there are in more standard or traditional hard drive technology offering a much more secure and safe method to transport your data.</p>

<p>Current SSD hard drives from Crucial Technology are available in three different sizes at <a href="http://www.kqzyfj.com/click-1548159-10863768">64GB</a>, <a href="http://www.kqzyfj.com/click-1548159-10863768">128GB</a> and <a href="http://www.kqzyfj.com/click-1548159-10863768">256GB</a> are compatible with a wide range of notebook and desktop computers. The 64GB is currently on sale at 124.99, the 128GB SSD drive is priced at $249.99 and the biggest SSD drive from Crucial is 256GB and $499.</p>

<p>As you can see from the SSD hard drive prices above this new hard drive technology, while affordable, can cost more money than standard hard drives but as the technology increases in the hard drive arena the SSD hard drive prices will fall.</p>

<p>Now that you’re aware of the prices of SSD hard drives, the next question is will your notebook or desktop be able to use and accomodate the much faster SSD hard drive from Crucial? With one of the best memory upgrade configurators in the market today for their ram and memory products it comes as no surprise that Crucial offers a configurator that will help you buy the best SSD hard drive for your computer as well. Just use the hand pull down menu and select your computer manufacturer, computer product line and specific computer model and you will get a free SSD hard drive compatibility report that will help you find the right SSD drive for your computing needs.</p>

<p>In my case, I am writing this on an Apple MacBook Pro. A 2008 Intel Core 2 Duo running at 2.4GHz and after entering the specifics of my particular Mac I am presented with a list of SSD hard drives that are guaranteed to be compatible with my MacBook Pro:<br />
<a href="http://www.kqzyfj.com/click-1548159-10863768"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1040" title="Best Price  SSD drives" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-13-at-4.49.17-PM.png" alt="solid state hard drive prices" width="532" height="470" /></a></p>

<p>This is all it takes to get the right solid state hard drive from Crucial Technology.</p>

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p><strong>Why RAM for Macs?</strong></p>

<p>Macintosh RAM are the ram prices I tend to monitor and track here on ramseeker and according to you guys, you are most interested in the best prices on Apple RAM too, even though I do track and monitor PC memory too which is common, some might say more common even than the Apple Products.</p>

<p>**<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I">See Best Macintosh RAM Prices</a><br />
**<br />
Apple products **for me **work better, run smoother and over the past two decades I’ve been a Mac user I just prefer a Mac over a PC when it comes to buying a computer, so I work with the Memory upgrades that I know and work with daily. I’m using a Mac right now (MacBook Pro) as I write this.</p>

<p>There once was a time about decade or so where the RAM for Macs were actually different and you could not interchange Mac and PC RAM at all, but in 2011 the difference between Mac and PC memory has pretty much disappeared and PC memory will work in your Mac and vice versa. This assumes the technical requirements for Apple and PC RAM is the same. If you’re trying to install notebook memory for Mac into a PC desktop, this is a recipe for disaster. But if the new windows notebook takes the same ram as the Mac you already have, you could swap out the RAM between Apple and PC computers.</p>

<p>Some stores list their memory upgrades as Apple only, and tend to cater to the Apple customer more. <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/ramjet">RAMJET</a> and <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/OWC">OWC</a> are two memory stores that have long supported and sold Apple RAM exclusively, where other vendors such as <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">Crucial</a> or <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/1800">18004Memory</a> also sell RAM for Macs but also carry RAM for Windows PC’s too.</p>

<p><strong>Where to Buy Macintosh RAM</strong></p>

<p>Apple RAM is available from a <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/where-to-buy-computer-memory-upgrades/">long list of stores</a> where you can <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">buy RAM</a> so I won’t repeat myself. There’s also a list of the best memory stores in the top right corner of this page of where you can buy Macintosh RAM for less than what you would pay if you had bough RAM from Apple Computer directly.</p>

<p>**Cheapest Memory Prices for Macintosh RAM **</p>

<p>I have been monitoring <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com">Apple RAM Prices</a></strong> for longer than I’d care to admit so the list is long of all the Macintosh computers I check the best prices for and over the years as new Apple computers get released, I update the site with RAM for the newest Macintosh computers available, as I did recently with the latest i5 and i7 MacBook Pros, but I also monitor prices for the 2010 Macintosh Models too. MacBook, iMac, Mac Mini and Mac Pro RAM prices are much cheaper when you <strong>buy ram online</strong> from some of the best RAM stores in the business today.</p>

<p>But that’s not the case and if you <strong>shop around for a MacBook</strong> you can get a pretty good price. Gone are the days where we could just buy, buy, buy and barely look at the <strong>price of Apple computers</strong> and if you’re in the market to buy a MacBook which is the budget notebook from Apple there’s a good chance you have a budget for this new MacBook purchase and you can only spend so much money on Apple’s consumer portable.</p>

One of the first places I check for MacBook deals is <a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple</a>. Then you know exactly how much a MacBook would cost when you buy it from the Apple Store.</p>

<p>We’re going to assume you’re shopping for a brand new MacBook and if you’re in the market for a used MacBook which are still viable machines, a good place to start shopping for used macbook deals are <a href="http://www.ebay.com">eBay</a> and <a href="http://www.craigslist.com">Craigslist</a> where you can with some time effort and patience get a great deal on a used MacBook but you have to be much more aware of scams and dishonest sellers than if you were to buy a new MacBook from an Apple Authorized dealer.</p>

<p>**MacBook Deals at Amazon<br />
**<br />
One of the first places I check for Apple MacBooks at better prices than Apple is Amazon. The savings may not be much (usually just a few percent) but the benefit of Amazon is they offer bundles for greater savings on MacBook Accesories</p>

<p>An example would be like this Apple MacBook Bundle:<br />
Buy the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002C7489S/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002C7489S">Apple MacBook 13 inch</a>, add <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VWK4NI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002VWK4NI">AppleCare</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003YCOJAI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B003YCOJAI">Microsoft Office Mac</a> for Home and Student and you get a much better deal on the these three items than if you had bought them individually. The savings on the MacBook alone is worth it as the final price is much closer to $900 than the $999 MSRP from Apple.</p>

<p>**MacMall MacBook Bundles<br />
**<br />
MacMall has long been another favorite of mine when in the market for a new Apple computer as this online Apple store usually has some really good deals on MacBooks that you can’t beat as their approach is a bit different when pricing MacBooks. Instead of creating bundles as is popular when you buy a MacBook from Amazon, MacMall tends to compete by offering a lot of free MacBook accessories such as printers, mice and software to sweeten the MacBook deal. Or sometimes they just offer the MacBook for much less than the Apple Store would charge. A **$<a href="http://www.kqzyfj.com/click-1548159-10380674">935.00 MacBook Price</a> **is much better than a $999 MacBook Price in my books. That’s a $65 saving for buying the exact same item and a much better Macbook deal overall.</p>

<p>With the release of the latest Apple MacBook Pro models a few weeks back, and the past few weeks of most memory stores adding the MacBook Pro RAM to their stores, I think it’s safe to say that with few exceptions the MacBook Pro Memory prices have settled and now we know what’s available for RAM for the first new Macs to come from Apple in 2011<br />
[table id=1 /]</p>

<p>I have specifically highlighted a few stores that were <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/ramjet">first</a> <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">to</a> <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/OWC">market</a> the MacBook Pro RAM, and earlier this week we also know that you can <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/2011-apple-macbook-pro-16gb-memory-upgrades/">spend more on RAM for MacBook Pros</a> than the MacBook Pro itself with $1700 RAM upgrades for MacBook Pro’s being available to purchase. My guess is the 16GB RAM prices will settle once more vendors come online with 16GB MacBook Pr RAM, and unless every millisecond counts the 8GB MacBook Pro RAM Kits offer far more reasonable value with <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">MacBook Pro RAM  under $100 </a></strong>– a fraction of what it costs for the 16GB RAM upgrade kits</p>

<p style="line-height: 18px;">
  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1136" title="Best Price MacBook Pro" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-24-at-7.39.14-AM.png" alt="See Best Price on MacBook Pro" width="283" height="223" /></a>
</p>

<p><strong style="line-height: 18px;"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I">Best MacBook Pro Prices</a></strong></p>

<p><strong style="line-height: 18px;"></strong>At the time I write this  you can buy 8GB, 12GB, and now 16GB RAM for MacBook Pros. I have yet to add the 16GB kits  yet because so far,it’s just OWC that offers these and there’s not much need to compare prices on 16GB RAM when only one memory vendor sells this very expensive RAM for MacBook Pros  so far.</p>

<p>The best deal is the 8GB memory upgrade kits for MacBook Pros that under $100 make it a no nonsense and cheap way to double the RAM in Apple’s newest MacBook Pros that require different memory than the 2008-2010 Apple MacBook Pros. The new MacBook Pros use DDR3 PC10600 1333MHz RAM which is a different memory type than the older MBP’s which used DDR3 1066 SDRAM sodimms for memory upgrades.  It should come as no surprise that the faster RAM combined with the faster i5 and i7 Intel processors in the MacBook Pro’s for 2011 result the fastest notebooks Apple has ever built to date with the 2011 MacBook Pro updates.</p>

<p>RAM Upgrades for the 2011 Apple MacBook Pros are available by <strong>upgrading the factory memory in the MacBook Pro</strong> with larger 4GB chips or the newest 8GB DDR3 1333MHz notebook memory modules, resulting in 4GB, 8GB, 12GB and 16GB upgrades available.</p>

<p>The  12GB memory upgrade kit seems to me to be the black sheep out of all the memory configurations. Due to the <strong>current cost of 8GB RAM modules</strong> for the MBP’s it makes sense to either buy the 8GB or 16GB memory upgrade kits. If you are going to upgrade the RAM, I have always felt that it’s best to do it by doubling the RAM you currently have. Yes, 12GB is still  more RAM than 8GB but due to the costs I would wait until those 8GB RAM chips drop in price, as they will.</p>

<p>One word: <strong>Don’t</strong>. You can get a much better <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="apple memory deal">deal on Apple Memory</a></strong></p>

<p>This is simple <strong>advice on memory upgrades</strong> if you are in the market to <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/">buy the cheapest RAM</a> for your Macintosh, in most cases you will not find it at <a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple</a>. The one and only reason why you might want to buy Apple RAM is if you value convenience over cost.<br />
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1146" title="Best Selling Apple RAM" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-24-at-1.55.27-PM.png" alt="Best Apple RAM Price" width="308" height="237" /></a></p>

**</p>

<p>You might be able to <strong>save some money on Apple RAM</strong> if you buy a Mac at the same time online from the Apple Store, as you could buy a Macintosh  Computer filled with RAM from Apple to the maximum capacity negating the need to replace the factory memory from Apple with bigger memory upgrade modules at a later date. This will save you some money if you buy a Mac at the same time.</p>

<p>Let’s investigate, and assume a new 13 inch MacBook Pro is the Apple computer you want to buy from Apple and fill it with 8GB of RAM – the maximum memory for MacBook Pro as advised from Apple (although the good <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/2011-apple-macbook-pro-16gb-memory-upgrades/">folks at OWC</a> will tell you otherwise):</p>

<p>**Cost for the 2011 13 inch 2.3 GHz MacBook Pro from Apple: $1199<br />
Cost for filling the MacBook with 8GB from Apple: additional $200. **</p>

<p>This brings a 13 inch MacBook Pro to $1399 with 8GB if you buy it from Apple.</p>

<p>Plan B would be to still <strong>buy the 13 inch MacBook Pro from Amazon and save a few bucks:</strong> <strong>$1194.00.</strong> Not much of a deal on a Mac Notebook but hey, five bucks is five bucks.</p>

<p>Now we go <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/shopping-advice-buy-memory-online-and-save-money/">ram shopping online</a> for the best ram deal on 8GB MacBook Pro RAM and at the time of writing 8GB memory upgrade kits can be bought from <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">Crucial Technology</a></strong> for just $97.00, which is not only considerably cheaper RAM than buying from Apple, but Crucial Technology is a well respected and trusted memory store that both makes, manufactures and supports the RAM you buy, and all for under $100 for MacBook Pro RAM.</p>

<p><strong>Total cost for a 13 inch 2.3GHz MacBook Pro with 8GB of RAM when you buy the MacBook Pro from Amazon and the RAM from Crucial: $1291.00</strong></p>

<p>So buying your MacBook Pro memory from a trusted and respected third party memory store you <strong>save over $100 on your MacBook Pro</strong>.</p>

<p>But this gets better: You still have the <strong>2x 2GB DDR3 1333 MHz RAM Upgrades</strong> that you pulled from your original MacBook Pro and if you choose to spend a few bucks more on MacBook Pro RAM.. let’s use OWC, as they will <a href="http://eshop.macsales.com/tech_center/support/rebates/memory.cfm">accept trade ins on your MacBook Memory</a> and will <strong>offer you $26 for your factory installed MacBook RAM.</strong></p>

<p>OWC charges $112.99 at time of writing for 8GB MacBook Pro RAM Kits. Subtract the $26.00 for the factory RAM trade in and your total cost for 8GB of RAM for 13 inch MacBook Pro drops to $86.99, which beats the Crucial RAM price and brings the <strong>total cost for a 13 inch MacBook Pro down another $11.00 to $1280.00</strong>. This ends up being savings of $120.00 when you compare against buying the same MacBook Pro from Apple Directly.</p>

<p>For some, <strong>the $120 savings on a 13 inch MacBook Pro</strong> is more than enough for you to decide to buy both the Apple notebook and the memory upgrades from a third party store. But for others, it’s not worth the $120 savings and you value convenience over cost and possibly: warranty issues.</p>

<p>When you buy both the Apple Macintosh and the <a href="http://store.apple.com/us/memoryfamily/ME_MBP">RAM directly from Apple</a>, in the slight chance that there is a problem with your new MacBook, it is possible Apple could blame the third party RAM as the problem with your Apple notebook, negating any  savings with the time you spend troubleshooting problems with your MacBook Pro.<br />
It’s up to you whether you choose to buy RAM direct from Apple Computer but be aware that when compared against other options for memory  upgrades that tend to be cheaper  the Apple Store memory upgrade will always be the most expensive memory you can buy.</p>

<p>This 16GB RAM upgrade is compatible with all Apple MacBook Pros that require 1600Mhz DDR3 SDRAM sodimms,and to get to the maximum of 16GB of RAM you will need to buy 8GBx2 as there are still only two memory upgrade slots available for RAM upgrades int the new MBP’s but if you either have bought a MacBook Pro or in the market to buy a MacBook Pro you should upgrade the RAM to at least the maximum that Apple recommends which is 8GB.</p>

<p>The best RAM upgrade for the MacBook Pro is the 16GB ram option, because if you are upgrading MacBook Pro memory you may as well do it right and do it once and <a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT102464BF160B%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT102464BF160B">buy 16GB of MacBook Pro RAM</a> if you can afford to.</p>

<p>But if you are wanting to compare <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I">2.3 GHz MacBook Pros</a> versus 2.7 GHz MacBook Pros, you are limited to the 13 inch Apple MacBook Pro which is currently available in these two configurations, with the difference being $300 between the two models: 2.3GHz vs 2.7Ghz MacBook Pros</p>

<p>That’s the first question I would ask when deciding <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26x%3D0%26ref_%3Dnb_sb_noss%26y%3D0%26field-keywords%3Dmacbook%2520pro%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">what Apple MacBook Pro to buy</a></strong>, regardless of screen size or feature set.</p>

<p>Both models ship with the same <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">4GB DDR3 1333MHz RAM</a>, and the hard drive space is minimally larger – <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26x%3D0%26ref_%3Dnb_sb_noss%26y%3D0%26field-keywords%3Dmacbook%2520pro%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">320GB</a> versus <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26x%3D0%26ref_%3Dnb_sb_noss%26y%3D0%26field-keywords%3D500gb%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">500GB</a> hard drives when comparing the two 13 inch MacBook Pros leaving the faster processor vs the slower processor speed your main difference between the two 2011 13 inch MacBook Pro models.</p>

<p>Let’s assume you <strong>buy the 13 inch MacBook Pro</strong> directly from Apple and you don’t get any deals or any other MacBook Pro discounts. This means that excluding sales taxes and shipping the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I">13 inch 2.3GHz MacBook Pro</a> will cost you $1199 and the 13 inch 2.7 inch MacBook Pro will cost you $300 more at $1499.00. This, as I have noted in the past is a $300 price difference between the two.</p>

<p>Now, if money is not a concern, this is an easy question to answer: Buy the 2.7 inch MacBook Pro, but if you need the cheapest MacBook Pro currently ons sale then the cheap MacBook Pro is the better deal. You might also want to consider adding a warranty option to your MacBook  Pro and  ask yourself: is AppleCare worth it? Some may think the included one year warranty is all they need, while some might say portables demand extented warranty due to all the possibilities of things that can go wrong on your MacBook Pro</p>

<p>**What is your time worth?<br />
**<br />
We also need to consider what you plan on using the MacBook Pro for. If the intended use of the MacBook Pro (and this advice applies to any model) is for business the choice is easy: Buy the 13 inch 2.7MHz MBP. Assuming you keep the MacBook Pro for a year, which is a reasonable time frame to buy and use a new computer, the added cost for the higher end MacBook Pro works out to just pennies per day and not even a dollar a day more. The cost to own the 13 inch MacBook Pro works out to $4.10 per day, so if you make money with your MacBook Pro and it’s more than the measly four bucks, you will be more productive, which results in even more money being made. It would not be hard to make over $4.00 per day with any notebook – Apple or otherwise. I know I do. <img src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p>**What is your MacBook Budget?<br />
**<br />
But, what if you’re a consumer who wants a more powerful, modern and faster computer than the current MacBook lineup that’s getting a bit old and are considering buying a 13 inch MacBook Pro. And even though it is not the cheapest MacBook you can buy you can swing the $200 more for the<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I"> 2.3 GHz model, </a>but when yo consider that you are not using this MacBook Pro for business and more as a portable computer for cafes and the couch, the added $300 on top of the added $200 for the Pro version brings you to $500 more than the MacBook line and with another $500 you could buy two MacBooks or <a href="http:/http://www.ramseeker.com/?p=997">buy a MacBook</a> when you need a full sized keyboard with contemporary design but use that $500 surplus and buy a just released Apple iPad 2 with the same $1500 budget. For the consumer, the choice on what MacBook Pro to buy seems to me to be considerably tougher due to the fact that you have much more choices in how to spend your computer dollars. If you need to buy the cheapest Mac portable, then you should be looking at the MacBook line, but if you can afford it, I would <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/?p=997">buy the 2.3GHz MacBook Pro.</a> Yes, this is the more expensive option but with that extra $200 you get a faster, more modern Apple notebook that at first blush might be the more expensive choice, but you may get more use and enjoyment over time.</p>

<p>Where the current MacBook might indeed be the <strong>cheaper notebook</strong>, it will also age faster and although fast enough for almost every task your average consumer could want, the 13 inch Macbook Pro is the <strong>better MacBook deal</strong> and the MacBook I would buy unless you really cannot afford the extra $200.</p>

<p>What about MacBook Pro screen size?</p>

<p>One other factor to consider when buying a new MacBook Pro is not only price and processor speed – but LCD display size as well. At $1499 the 13 inch MacBook Pro is just $300 away from a <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BNHM0C?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000BNHM0C">15 inch Apple MacBook Pro</a></strong> at $1799, and with that added $300 to the overall cost of the 2.7GHz Macbook Pro 13 inch comes one thing that a lot of users value and that is screen real estate.</p>

<p>Not only do you get a <strong>bigger LCD display</strong> when you <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/">buy a 15 inch MacBook Pro</a>, but you get a bump in processing speed with the 15 inch MacBook Pro offering Intel quad core i7 processors vs the $1499 13 incher’s 2.7Ghz dual core Intel i5 processors. The quad core processors run slower at 2.0 GHz, and not all applications will take advantage of the added cores yet, but if you’re a professional that can uses the MacBook Pro and needs lots of windows open or menus visable, the 15 inch MacBook Pro might allow you to work faster for no other reason than there’s more screen real estate and pixels to use and take advantage of. The cheaper 15 inch MacBook Pro is definitely a MacBook Pro to consider if the 13 inch 2.7 Ghz is also on the list of the MacBook Pros you are considering buying.</p>

<p>To summarize, it’s not an easy decision to choose between the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I">2.3 Ghz</a> and 2.7 inch MacBook Pro when it comes time to buy a new Apple notebook but unless you really need the extra speed the .4 GHz and the 120 GB of extra hard drive space offers, it’s my opinion that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I">2011 2.3GHz 13 inch MacBook Pro </a>is the <strong>best deal on an Apple notebook computer</strong> available today.</p>
