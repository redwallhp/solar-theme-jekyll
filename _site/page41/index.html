<p>When shopping for the **<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26scn%3D541966%26redirect%3Dtrue%26ref_%3Dsr_nr_scat_541966_t%26keywords%3Dmacbook%26qid%3D1299936793%26h%3D179243ea296a92643bd104ef6c759ae67c9c0702%26rh%3Dn%253A541966%252Ck%253Amacbook&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">best MacBook deal</a> **one might assume that you would get the lowest price on a MacBook (and MacBook accessories, for that matter) directly from the the mother ship itself: <a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple</a>.</p>

<p>But that’s not the case and if you <strong>shop around for a MacBook</strong> you can get a pretty good price. Gone are the days where we could just buy, buy, buy and barely look at the <strong>price of Apple computers</strong> and if you’re in the market to buy a MacBook which is the budget notebook from Apple there’s a good chance you have a budget for this new MacBook purchase and you can only spend so much money on Apple’s consumer portable.</p>

<p>**MacBook Deals at Apple<br />
**<br />
One of the first places I check for MacBook deals is <a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple</a>. Then you know exactly how much a MacBook would cost when you buy it from the Apple Store.</p>

<p>We’re going to assume you’re shopping for a brand new MacBook and if you’re in the market for a used MacBook which are still viable machines, a good place to start shopping for used macbook deals are <a href="http://www.ebay.com">eBay</a> and <a href="http://www.craigslist.com">Craigslist</a> where you can with some time effort and patience get a great deal on a used MacBook but you have to be much more aware of scams and dishonest sellers than if you were to buy a new MacBook from an Apple Authorized dealer.</p>

<p>**MacBook Deals at Amazon<br />
**<br />
One of the first places I check for Apple MacBooks at better prices than Apple is Amazon. The savings may not be much (usually just a few percent) but the benefit of Amazon is they offer bundles for greater savings on MacBook Accesories</p>

<p>An example would be like this Apple MacBook Bundle:<br />
Buy the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002C7489S/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002C7489S">Apple MacBook 13 inch</a>, add <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VWK4NI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002VWK4NI">AppleCare</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003YCOJAI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B003YCOJAI">Microsoft Office Mac</a> for Home and Student and you get a much better deal on the these three items than if you had bought them individually. The savings on the MacBook alone is worth it as the final price is much closer to $900 than the $999 MSRP from Apple.</p>

<p>**MacMall MacBook Bundles<br />
**<br />
MacMall has long been another favorite of mine when in the market for a new Apple computer as this online Apple store usually has some really good deals on MacBooks that you can’t beat as their approach is a bit different when pricing MacBooks. Instead of creating bundles as is popular when you buy a MacBook from Amazon, MacMall tends to compete by offering a lot of free MacBook accessories such as printers, mice and software to sweeten the MacBook deal. Or sometimes they just offer the MacBook for much less than the Apple Store would charge. A **$<a href="http://www.kqzyfj.com/click-1548159-10380674">935.00 MacBook Price</a> **is much better than a $999 MacBook Price in my books. That’s a $65 saving for buying the exact same item and a much better Macbook deal overall.</p>

<p>With the release of the latest Apple MacBook Pro models a few weeks back, and the past few weeks of most memory stores adding the MacBook Pro RAM to their stores, I think it’s safe to say that with few exceptions the MacBook Pro Memory prices have settled and now we know what’s available for RAM for the first new Macs to come from Apple in 2011<br />
[table id=1 /]</p>

<p>I have specifically highlighted a few stores that were <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/ramjet">first</a> <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">to</a> <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/OWC">market</a> the MacBook Pro RAM, and earlier this week we also know that you can <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/2011-apple-macbook-pro-16gb-memory-upgrades/">spend more on RAM for MacBook Pros</a> than the MacBook Pro itself with $1700 RAM upgrades for MacBook Pro’s being available to purchase. My guess is the 16GB RAM prices will settle once more vendors come online with 16GB MacBook Pr RAM, and unless every millisecond counts the 8GB MacBook Pro RAM Kits offer far more reasonable value with <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">MacBook Pro RAM  under $100 </a></strong>– a fraction of what it costs for the 16GB RAM upgrade kits</p>

<p style="line-height: 18px;">
  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1136" title="Best Price MacBook Pro" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-24-at-7.39.14-AM.png" alt="See Best Price on MacBook Pro" width="283" height="223" /></a>
</p>

<p><strong style="line-height: 18px;"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I">Best MacBook Pro Prices</a></strong></p>

<p><strong style="line-height: 18px;"></strong>At the time I write this  you can buy 8GB, 12GB, and now 16GB RAM for MacBook Pros. I have yet to add the 16GB kits  yet because so far,it’s just OWC that offers these and there’s not much need to compare prices on 16GB RAM when only one memory vendor sells this very expensive RAM for MacBook Pros  so far.</p>

<p>The best deal is the 8GB memory upgrade kits for MacBook Pros that under $100 make it a no nonsense and cheap way to double the RAM in Apple’s newest MacBook Pros that require different memory than the 2008-2010 Apple MacBook Pros. The new MacBook Pros use DDR3 PC10600 1333MHz RAM which is a different memory type than the older MBP’s which used DDR3 1066 SDRAM sodimms for memory upgrades.  It should come as no surprise that the faster RAM combined with the faster i5 and i7 Intel processors in the MacBook Pro’s for 2011 result the fastest notebooks Apple has ever built to date with the 2011 MacBook Pro updates.</p>

<p>RAM Upgrades for the 2011 Apple MacBook Pros are available by <strong>upgrading the factory memory in the MacBook Pro</strong> with larger 4GB chips or the newest 8GB DDR3 1333MHz notebook memory modules, resulting in 4GB, 8GB, 12GB and 16GB upgrades available.</p>

<p>The  12GB memory upgrade kit seems to me to be the black sheep out of all the memory configurations. Due to the <strong>current cost of 8GB RAM modules</strong> for the MBP’s it makes sense to either buy the 8GB or 16GB memory upgrade kits. If you are going to upgrade the RAM, I have always felt that it’s best to do it by doubling the RAM you currently have. Yes, 12GB is still  more RAM than 8GB but due to the costs I would wait until those 8GB RAM chips drop in price, as they will.</p>

<p>One word: <strong>Don’t</strong>. You can get a much better <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="apple memory deal">deal on Apple Memory</a></strong></p>

<p>This is simple <strong>advice on memory upgrades</strong> if you are in the market to <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/">buy the cheapest RAM</a> for your Macintosh, in most cases you will not find it at <a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple</a>. The one and only reason why you might want to buy Apple RAM is if you value convenience over cost.<br />
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1146" title="Best Selling Apple RAM" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-24-at-1.55.27-PM.png" alt="Best Apple RAM Price" width="308" height="237" /></a></p>

**</p>

<p>You might be able to <strong>save some money on Apple RAM</strong> if you buy a Mac at the same time online from the Apple Store, as you could buy a Macintosh  Computer filled with RAM from Apple to the maximum capacity negating the need to replace the factory memory from Apple with bigger memory upgrade modules at a later date. This will save you some money if you buy a Mac at the same time.</p>

<p>Let’s investigate, and assume a new 13 inch MacBook Pro is the Apple computer you want to buy from Apple and fill it with 8GB of RAM – the maximum memory for MacBook Pro as advised from Apple (although the good <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/2011-apple-macbook-pro-16gb-memory-upgrades/">folks at OWC</a> will tell you otherwise):</p>

<p>**Cost for the 2011 13 inch 2.3 GHz MacBook Pro from Apple: $1199<br />
Cost for filling the MacBook with 8GB from Apple: additional $200. **</p>

<p>This brings a 13 inch MacBook Pro to $1399 with 8GB if you buy it from Apple.</p>

<p>Plan B would be to still <strong>buy the 13 inch MacBook Pro from Amazon and save a few bucks:</strong> <strong>$1194.00.</strong> Not much of a deal on a Mac Notebook but hey, five bucks is five bucks.</p>

<p>Now we go <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/shopping-advice-buy-memory-online-and-save-money/">ram shopping online</a> for the best ram deal on 8GB MacBook Pro RAM and at the time of writing 8GB memory upgrade kits can be bought from <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">Crucial Technology</a></strong> for just $97.00, which is not only considerably cheaper RAM than buying from Apple, but Crucial Technology is a well respected and trusted memory store that both makes, manufactures and supports the RAM you buy, and all for under $100 for MacBook Pro RAM.</p>

<p><strong>Total cost for a 13 inch 2.3GHz MacBook Pro with 8GB of RAM when you buy the MacBook Pro from Amazon and the RAM from Crucial: $1291.00</strong></p>

<p>So buying your MacBook Pro memory from a trusted and respected third party memory store you <strong>save over $100 on your MacBook Pro</strong>.</p>

<p>But this gets better: You still have the <strong>2x 2GB DDR3 1333 MHz RAM Upgrades</strong> that you pulled from your original MacBook Pro and if you choose to spend a few bucks more on MacBook Pro RAM.. let’s use OWC, as they will <a href="http://eshop.macsales.com/tech_center/support/rebates/memory.cfm">accept trade ins on your MacBook Memory</a> and will <strong>offer you $26 for your factory installed MacBook RAM.</strong></p>

<p>OWC charges $112.99 at time of writing for 8GB MacBook Pro RAM Kits. Subtract the $26.00 for the factory RAM trade in and your total cost for 8GB of RAM for 13 inch MacBook Pro drops to $86.99, which beats the Crucial RAM price and brings the <strong>total cost for a 13 inch MacBook Pro down another $11.00 to $1280.00</strong>. This ends up being savings of $120.00 when you compare against buying the same MacBook Pro from Apple Directly.</p>

<p>For some, <strong>the $120 savings on a 13 inch MacBook Pro</strong> is more than enough for you to decide to buy both the Apple notebook and the memory upgrades from a third party store. But for others, it’s not worth the $120 savings and you value convenience over cost and possibly: warranty issues.</p>

<p>When you buy both the Apple Macintosh and the <a href="http://store.apple.com/us/memoryfamily/ME_MBP">RAM directly from Apple</a>, in the slight chance that there is a problem with your new MacBook, it is possible Apple could blame the third party RAM as the problem with your Apple notebook, negating any  savings with the time you spend troubleshooting problems with your MacBook Pro.<br />
It’s up to you whether you choose to buy RAM direct from Apple Computer but be aware that when compared against other options for memory  upgrades that tend to be cheaper  the Apple Store memory upgrade will always be the most expensive memory you can buy.</p>

<p>This 16GB RAM upgrade is compatible with all Apple MacBook Pros that require 1600Mhz DDR3 SDRAM sodimms,and to get to the maximum of 16GB of RAM you will need to buy 8GBx2 as there are still only two memory upgrade slots available for RAM upgrades int the new MBP’s but if you either have bought a MacBook Pro or in the market to buy a MacBook Pro you should upgrade the RAM to at least the maximum that Apple recommends which is 8GB.</p>

<p>The best RAM upgrade for the MacBook Pro is the 16GB ram option, because if you are upgrading MacBook Pro memory you may as well do it right and do it once and <a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT102464BF160B%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT102464BF160B">buy 16GB of MacBook Pro RAM</a> if you can afford to.</p>

<p>But if you are wanting to compare <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I">2.3 GHz MacBook Pros</a> versus 2.7 GHz MacBook Pros, you are limited to the 13 inch Apple MacBook Pro which is currently available in these two configurations, with the difference being $300 between the two models: 2.3GHz vs 2.7Ghz MacBook Pros</p>

<p>That’s the first question I would ask when deciding <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26x%3D0%26ref_%3Dnb_sb_noss%26y%3D0%26field-keywords%3Dmacbook%2520pro%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">what Apple MacBook Pro to buy</a></strong>, regardless of screen size or feature set.</p>

<p>Both models ship with the same <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">4GB DDR3 1333MHz RAM</a>, and the hard drive space is minimally larger – <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26x%3D0%26ref_%3Dnb_sb_noss%26y%3D0%26field-keywords%3Dmacbook%2520pro%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">320GB</a> versus <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26x%3D0%26ref_%3Dnb_sb_noss%26y%3D0%26field-keywords%3D500gb%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">500GB</a> hard drives when comparing the two 13 inch MacBook Pros leaving the faster processor vs the slower processor speed your main difference between the two 2011 13 inch MacBook Pro models.</p>

<p>Let’s assume you <strong>buy the 13 inch MacBook Pro</strong> directly from Apple and you don’t get any deals or any other MacBook Pro discounts. This means that excluding sales taxes and shipping the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I">13 inch 2.3GHz MacBook Pro</a> will cost you $1199 and the 13 inch 2.7 inch MacBook Pro will cost you $300 more at $1499.00. This, as I have noted in the past is a $300 price difference between the two.</p>

<p>Now, if money is not a concern, this is an easy question to answer: Buy the 2.7 inch MacBook Pro, but if you need the cheapest MacBook Pro currently ons sale then the cheap MacBook Pro is the better deal. You might also want to consider adding a warranty option to your MacBook  Pro and  ask yourself: is AppleCare worth it? Some may think the included one year warranty is all they need, while some might say portables demand extented warranty due to all the possibilities of things that can go wrong on your MacBook Pro</p>

<p>**What is your time worth?<br />
**<br />
We also need to consider what you plan on using the MacBook Pro for. If the intended use of the MacBook Pro (and this advice applies to any model) is for business the choice is easy: Buy the 13 inch 2.7MHz MBP. Assuming you keep the MacBook Pro for a year, which is a reasonable time frame to buy and use a new computer, the added cost for the higher end MacBook Pro works out to just pennies per day and not even a dollar a day more. The cost to own the 13 inch MacBook Pro works out to $4.10 per day, so if you make money with your MacBook Pro and it’s more than the measly four bucks, you will be more productive, which results in even more money being made. It would not be hard to make over $4.00 per day with any notebook – Apple or otherwise. I know I do. <img src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p>**What is your MacBook Budget?<br />
**<br />
But, what if you’re a consumer who wants a more powerful, modern and faster computer than the current MacBook lineup that’s getting a bit old and are considering buying a 13 inch MacBook Pro. And even though it is not the cheapest MacBook you can buy you can swing the $200 more for the<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I"> 2.3 GHz model, </a>but when yo consider that you are not using this MacBook Pro for business and more as a portable computer for cafes and the couch, the added $300 on top of the added $200 for the Pro version brings you to $500 more than the MacBook line and with another $500 you could buy two MacBooks or <a href="http:/http://www.ramseeker.com/?p=997">buy a MacBook</a> when you need a full sized keyboard with contemporary design but use that $500 surplus and buy a just released Apple iPad 2 with the same $1500 budget. For the consumer, the choice on what MacBook Pro to buy seems to me to be considerably tougher due to the fact that you have much more choices in how to spend your computer dollars. If you need to buy the cheapest Mac portable, then you should be looking at the MacBook line, but if you can afford it, I would <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/?p=997">buy the 2.3GHz MacBook Pro.</a> Yes, this is the more expensive option but with that extra $200 you get a faster, more modern Apple notebook that at first blush might be the more expensive choice, but you may get more use and enjoyment over time.</p>

<p>Where the current MacBook might indeed be the <strong>cheaper notebook</strong>, it will also age faster and although fast enough for almost every task your average consumer could want, the 13 inch Macbook Pro is the <strong>better MacBook deal</strong> and the MacBook I would buy unless you really cannot afford the extra $200.</p>

<p>What about MacBook Pro screen size?</p>

<p>One other factor to consider when buying a new MacBook Pro is not only price and processor speed – but LCD display size as well. At $1499 the 13 inch MacBook Pro is just $300 away from a <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BNHM0C?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000BNHM0C">15 inch Apple MacBook Pro</a></strong> at $1799, and with that added $300 to the overall cost of the 2.7GHz Macbook Pro 13 inch comes one thing that a lot of users value and that is screen real estate.</p>

<p>Not only do you get a <strong>bigger LCD display</strong> when you <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/">buy a 15 inch MacBook Pro</a>, but you get a bump in processing speed with the 15 inch MacBook Pro offering Intel quad core i7 processors vs the $1499 13 incher’s 2.7Ghz dual core Intel i5 processors. The quad core processors run slower at 2.0 GHz, and not all applications will take advantage of the added cores yet, but if you’re a professional that can uses the MacBook Pro and needs lots of windows open or menus visable, the 15 inch MacBook Pro might allow you to work faster for no other reason than there’s more screen real estate and pixels to use and take advantage of. The cheaper 15 inch MacBook Pro is definitely a MacBook Pro to consider if the 13 inch 2.7 Ghz is also on the list of the MacBook Pros you are considering buying.</p>

<p>To summarize, it’s not an easy decision to choose between the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I">2.3 Ghz</a> and 2.7 inch MacBook Pro when it comes time to buy a new Apple notebook but unless you really need the extra speed the .4 GHz and the 120 GB of extra hard drive space offers, it’s my opinion that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I">2011 2.3GHz 13 inch MacBook Pro </a>is the <strong>best deal on an Apple notebook computer</strong> available today.</p>

<p>The entry level MacBook Pro is a 13 inch configuration and offers the following as the main specifications:</p>

<ol>
  <li>2.3 GHz dual core Intel core i5 processor</li>

<p>Lastly, the 13 inch Apple MacBook Pro 2.3GHz is available with extended AppleCare, One to One membership and accessories such as cables and MacBook Pro cases all at additional cost.</p>

<p>**13 inch Apple MacBook Pro 2.7GHz<br />
**<br />
13 inch Apple MacBook Pro 2.7 GHz is the faster 13 inch MacBook Pro and offers a faster processor with a 2.7GHz Intel Core i7 processor and bigger hard drive at 500GB being the two main differences between the 2.3GHz and 2.7Ghz 13 inch MacBook Pro. All else stays the same as the cheapest MacBook Pro except for the price which is $300 more than the low end model with a MSRP of $1499.</p>

You may sacrifice a bit on portability when you compare the two models side by side but for some the 13 inch MacBook Pro is just too small a screen to work with</p>

</a> **</p>

<p>The cheaper 15 inch Apple MacBook Pro of the two Apple MacBook Pro models available in the 2011 MBP Pro lineup is the 15 inch 2.0 GHz model that boasts the following features as standard equipment:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A 2.0Ghz Quad Core Intel Core i7 Processor</li>
  <li>4GB 1333MHz DDR3 RAM</li>
  <li>500 GB 5400RPM Hard Drive</li>
  <li>Intel HD Graphics 3000 AMD Radeon HD 6490M with 256MB GDDR5</li>
  <li>Built in Battery lasting up to 7 hours</li>
</ol>

<p>All this is priced at just $1799, which is the suggested list price for the Apple MacBook Pro 15 inch 2.2GHz, but you can get a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BNHM0C?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000BNHM0C">better deal on the MacBook Pro</a> by shopping online from other various online stores for sales and deals as most others offer a bit better price on the 15 inch MacBook Pros than if you were to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BNHM0C?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000BNHM0C">buy a 15 inch MacBook Pro</a> from Apple.</p>

</a> **</p>

<p>The higher end 15 inch MacBook offers a faster processor and runs at 2.2 GHz using the same Intel i7 processor but just a tad faster for power users looking for the fastest 15 inch MacBook Pro Apple makes today. Other features on the 2.2GHz Apple MacBook Pro are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>4GB DDR3 1333MHz Memory</li>
  <li>Intel HD Graphics 3000</li>
  <li>AMD Radeon HD 6750M with 1GB GDDR5</li>
  <li>Built in Battery lasting up to 7 hours</li>
</ol>

<p>The processor is faster, the hard drive is bigger and the graphics card on the high end 15 inch MBP is much faster, and those are the main differences between the 2 MacBook Pro 15 inch models save for the price which is listed as $2199 when you buy a MacBook Pro from Apple, but I you can get a better MacBook Pro 15 inch Price shopping online from other online stores and resources.</p>

<p>The <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002C74D7A?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002C74D7A">17 inch Apple MacBook Pro</a></strong> is for a lot of users, a desktop replacement thanks to the big and bright LCD display that graces the MacBook Pro at the high end of the MBP lineup. The 2.2 GHz is the same speed with the same processor than the 15 inch 2.2 GHz MacBook Pro but the 17 incher offers much more real estate in the screen dept. Priced at another $300 more than the 15 inch model but all other specifications being the same it will be up to you whether you deem the added 2 inches of display space to be worth the extra costs.</p>

<p>Apple has come out with an impressive MacBook Pro lineup, but I’m surprised that the maximum memory is not 16GB on these professional Apple notebooks, as the iMac ha been boasting a 16GB ram maximum for some time now. Perhaps this is on purpose so as not to cannibalize the iMac sales, or more likely the technology or space just isn’t there yet. 8GB ram modules in DDR3 1333Mhz would be cost prohibitive at this point anyway so maybe Apple’s on the right track with this latest MacBook Pro lineup.</p>

<p>**What’s new on all MacBook Pros for 2011<br />
**</p>

<p>A slew of new features across the board make the 2011 Apple MacBook Pros a best buy this year when it comes to the new professional MacBooks:</p>

<p>**Faster Processors<br />
**</p>

<p>Starting with the 13 inch MacBook Pro, the slowest MacBook Pro of the bunch still offer dual core Intel i5 Processors and the 15 inch and 17 inch MacBook Pros offer quad core i7 processors making the the newest Apple MacBooks up to twice as fast as the previous models.</p>

<p>**ThunderBolt<br />
**<br />
Thunderbolt is new technology from Apple introduced first on the MacBook Pro lineup that allows you to use one connector running at up to 10MBps to connect both external peripherals and displays as well, offering less cables and faster speeds when communicating with external devices. USB just got old.</p>

<p>**Faster Graphics<br />
** Newer graphics cards with up to 1GB of RAM eliminate any bottleneck in the processing of graphics. Perfect for grapics professionals such as those using Aperture 3 or Adobe Photoshop.</p>

<p>**HD Face Time<br />
**</p>

<p>Face Time, Apple’s full screen video call technology goes HD that are sharper and more crisp than the video produced in previous MacBook Pro models</p>

<p>Included when you buy any new MacBook Pro model in 2011 is the MacBook Pro portable computer, the Magsafe Power Adapter, wall plug and power cord and included software dvds and a display polishing cloth to keep your new MacBook Display like the day you bought it.</p>

<p>Lastly the MacBook Pro models, regardless of screen size come with Mac OS Snow Leopard and iLife ’11 which includes iPhoto, iMove, GarageBand, iWeb and iDVD which all allow you to control, create and discover your photos, movies, and music on Apple’s new MacBook Pro professional notebook computers.</p>

<p>I have created two pages for the 2011 MacBook Pro’s as like always over the years if you’re in the market for the best prices on MacBook Pro RAM you need to check for both <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_Pro_DDR3_1333Mhz_Memory_Upgrades-4gb/">4GB MacBook Pro DDR3 Memory Modules</a> as well as <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_Pro_DDR3_1333Mhz_Memory_Upgrade_Kits-8gb/">8GB MacBook Pro Memory Upgrade Kits</a> as some stores only ship modules and others carry only the kits so be sure to check both for the best deal on 2011 MacBook Pro Memory Upgrades.</p>

<p>I’m surprised Apple didn’t bump the maximum memory on the 2011 MacBook Pros to a maximum of 16GB as this is what the new Apple iMacs can handle for almost a year now so I really assumed that 16GB of RAM for the MacBook Pros would be the default.</p>

<p>The new DDR3 MacBook Pro RAM for the 2011 MacBook Pros is compatible with the current Apple MacBook Computers and that’s for all versions – 13 inch to 17 inch models.</p>

The day of the release of the new MacBook Pro, Ramjet is the first memory vendor to offer the compatible DDR3-1333 RAM upgrades. Two upgrade options are available. The 4GB single SO-DIMM upgrades the MacBook Pro to 6GB, and an 8GB Kit (2x 4GB modules) which brings the MacBook up to its 8GB memory maximum.</p>

<p>The prices are significantly lower than the Apple price, with the <a href="http://www.ramjet.com/macbook.asp#BlackBezel" title="macbook memory">4GB module at $89.99,</a> and the <a href="http://www.ramjet.com/macbook.asp#BlackBezel" title="8GB macbook pro RAM">8GB kit at $149.99</a>. There is also a $40 trade-in rebate for the original 4GB that comes with the machine, which brings the total cost down to $109.99 for the 8GB upgrade.</p>

<p>All <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/ramjet" title="ramjet memory for macbook">Ramjet memory</a> comes with a lifetime warranty. Modules are in stock, available for immediate shipment.</p>

		<div class="post-content"><p><strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/acers3.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4100" title="acers3 deal" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/acers3.jpg" alt="best deal on Acer S3" width="300" height="300" /></a><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/save-100-off-an-acer-s3-ultrabook/" title="Save $100 off an Acer S3 UltraBook">A deal on an Acer ultrabook  I found today</a></strong> reminded me of  a question I wanted to ask, and that’s <strong>when you think we will see a small portable computer with similar features of the  Apple MacBook  Air, but for about half the price</strong>? My guess is in about six months or so from now, maybe in time for back to school in 2012.</p>

<p>Let’s face it. If you want to buy the<strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/pc/541966/?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957"> best computer online today you buy an Apple notebook</a></strong>.  If you don’t believe me, just have a look at the best selling notebooks at Amazon where 7 out of ten best sellers in the laptop department are Apple notebooks –  not windows PC’s.</p>

<p>But for the rest of us who actually work for every penny we spend, the opportunity to buy an Ultrabook at half the price of an Apple product is too great to ignore for some of us. At least it is for yours truly. I would love to buy a brand  new 2012 Apple MacBook  Air  if and when they are released but when you can get pretty much the same computer capable of the same tasks for half the price, one  might argue in favor of the Windows machine.</p>

<p><strong>UltraBooks Cost Too Much</strong></p>

<p>The problem with the first generation ultrabooks, and to some extent some of  the new 2012 ultra’s, is that at current retail prices they are too close to the price of an Apple MacBook Air for me to be willing to put up with the Windows experience when  can buy a MacBook Air for about the same dough.</p>

<p>For a comparison of Ultrabooks vs MacBook Air’s, I am not going to compare every last detail as there are differnces in the technical specs, but in my mind there’s two reasons to buy this new brand of notebook computer: size and weight, and hard drive speed thanks to the solid state hard drives included in these.</p>

<p>A 13.3. inch Apple Ultrabook costs just over $1100 on sale at Amazon and  the <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005MR58MG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B005MR58MG">Acer Aspire S3 costs $799</a></strong> from a variety of online vendors  including Amazon.</p>

<p>The Air has features the S3 doesn’t have but they both offer SSD hard drives and light weight at about 3lbs each. The difference for the  most part is operating system and $300. As I write this, I might be tempted to go with the MacBook Air  – assuming I can find the price difference.</p>

<p>Unless I really needed to buy an UltraBook today, I would wait until we see a half price ultrabook. By half price, I don’t mean half the pric of regular price, but at a price point where I can buy two ultrabooks for the price  of one MacBook Air and currently that means there has to be a $550 Ultrabook for these lightweight windows notebooks to really take off.</p>

<p>To be fair, it’s hard to buy a full featured notebook for that price, so let’s offer a little wiggle room and say that for me  to  buy a PC ultrabook over a MacBook Air  the ultrabooks need to drop  in price to the $500-$700 range. All that’s stopping them is the cost of the solid state drive, and with SSD drives continuing to fall it’s just a matter of  time before this happens.</p>

<p>We’re off to a good start with a $100 off Ultrabooks startin to appear, we just need to see the prices drop another hundred dollars at least for these small notebooks to start selling in quantity.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2011/01/cheap-macbook-ram/">Cheap Mac RAM for Apple MacBook Computers</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com">MacBook memory,</a> or MacBook RAM as it is commonly known is in my opinion the very best upgrade you can do on an Apple MacBook. It’s a better upgrade than hard drives, or even software and the best part is that in 2011 MacBook RAM is cheap, in fact, cheaper than it’s ever been in years. Only a few short months ago to max out the ram on a MacBook would cost upwards of one hundred dollars, but now in earkly 2011 the very same DDR3 ram upgrade consisting of a 4GB MacBook RAM kit can be bought for as little as $48.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1136" title="Best Price MacBook Pro" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-24-at-7.39.14-AM.png" alt="See Best Price on MacBook Pro" width="283" height="223" /></a></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I">Cheapest MacBook Pro: 13 Inch MacBook Pro</a></strong></p>

<p>The MacBook lineup has been refreshed by Apple over the years but the same design hasn’t changed much and the MacBook only accepts two different types of memory upgrades: For older MacBook models such as the Intel Core Processor MacBooks and even some Intel Core 2 processor MacBooks the memory required for these older MacBook model are DDR2 PC5300 DDR sodimms and although not required, it’s recommended that you install the MacBook Memory in pairs.</p>

<p>Some memory vendors suggest that more memory than Apple suggests can be installed in a MacBook and it may very be possible, I recommend you stick to what the maximum RAM for MacBook as suggested by Apple.. For older MacBooks requiring DDR2 RAM that max out at 2GB of memory, it has been suggested that 3GB of RAM will run fine in these Apple notebooks and for those MacBooks that max out at 4GB, it’s been suggested that 6GB of memory will run fine. This could be the case, as when the older MacBooks were released, the larger 2GB and 4GB memory chips were not available.</p>

<p>For the newer UniBody MacBook models, these run a faster motherboard speed at twice as fast as the older MacBooks and require DDR3 memory upgrades running at 1066Mhz. The newer MacBook models max out at 4GB of DDR3 RAM which is more than enough memory for most applications.</p>

<p>Buying MacBook Memory is a fine balance: You can buy the MacBook RAM directly from Apple either when you buy the MacBook, or you can purchase memory from Apple at a later date. Warranty will be no problem as you have Apple memory installed in an Apple product. But, and this is big: RAM from Apple will not be cheap.</p>

<p>What I suggest is buying ram for MacBooks from a trusted third party vendor that offer the same warranty and support as with Apple products, but without the inflated price tag that comes with the RAM when you buy from Apple directly.</p>

<p>Memory for MacBook can either be the cheapest MacBook RAM you can buy, or if you prefer you can spend a few more dollars and buy name brand memory from a vendor such as Crucial Technology. When shopping for RAM, the cheapest RAM is going to be generic RAM, which for most applications is just fine and still manufactured and tested to the Apple Specifications that the MacBook requires when it comes to RAM upgrades.</p>

<p>**Cheapest MacBook RAM Prices<br />
**<br />
I have created a table or chart of the cheapest MacBook RAM prices from a select few memory stores I can recommend that sell a quality memory product at a fair price: This list of MacBook memory prices change so you will always be sure to get the best prices on RAM for MacBook, regardless of what specific MacBook you have.</p>
