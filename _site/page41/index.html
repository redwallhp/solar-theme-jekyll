<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p><strong>June, 2012-</strong> The Apple MacBook Pro models I wrote about below have now been discountinued and replaced with much faster and cheaper MacBook Pro Models: The 2012 Apple MacBook Pro lineup now consists of the Apple MacBook Pro in 13 and 15 inch versions and the MacBook Pro 15 inch with Retina Display.  The 17 inch MacBook Pro has been discontinued. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/mn/search/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;field-keywords=macbook%20pro&amp;url=search-alias%3Delectronics"> See the best prices on the new MacBook Pro models</a></p>

<p>The new Apple MacBook Pros are probably the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26scn%3D565108%26redirect%3Dtrue%26ref_%3Dsr_nr_scat_565108_ln%26keywords%3Dapple%2520macbook%2520pro%26qid%3D1299601244%26h%3D621aeae1df9a264b9a4a8f750f947f33fbff58f8%26rh%3Dn%253A565108%252Ck%253Aapple%2520macbook%2520pro&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">best Apple notebooks</a> ever to be released yet and offer not only faster processors but a new connectivity options with the Thunderbolt technology the next generation of input and output devices, according to Apple. HD Facetime, faster graphics and the fact that both the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BNHM0C?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000BNHM0C">15 inch</a> and 17 inch 2011 <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26x%3D0%26ref_%3Dnb_sb_noss%26y%3D0%26field-keywords%3Dmacbook%2520pro%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">Apple MacBook Pros</a></strong> round out the main and most notable upgrades for the MBP’s this year to date.</p>

<p>But if you are wanting to compare <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I">2.3 GHz MacBook Pros</a> versus 2.7 GHz MacBook Pros, you are limited to the 13 inch Apple MacBook Pro which is currently available in these two configurations, with the difference being $300 between the two models: 2.3GHz vs 2.7Ghz MacBook Pros</p>

<p>That’s the first question I would ask when deciding <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26x%3D0%26ref_%3Dnb_sb_noss%26y%3D0%26field-keywords%3Dmacbook%2520pro%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">what Apple MacBook Pro to buy</a></strong>, regardless of screen size or feature set.</p>

<p>Both models ship with the same <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">4GB DDR3 1333MHz RAM</a>, and the hard drive space is minimally larger – <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26x%3D0%26ref_%3Dnb_sb_noss%26y%3D0%26field-keywords%3Dmacbook%2520pro%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">320GB</a> versus <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26x%3D0%26ref_%3Dnb_sb_noss%26y%3D0%26field-keywords%3D500gb%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">500GB</a> hard drives when comparing the two 13 inch MacBook Pros leaving the faster processor vs the slower processor speed your main difference between the two 2011 13 inch MacBook Pro models.</p>

<p>Let’s assume you <strong>buy the 13 inch MacBook Pro</strong> directly from Apple and you don’t get any deals or any other MacBook Pro discounts. This means that excluding sales taxes and shipping the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I">13 inch 2.3GHz MacBook Pro</a> will cost you $1199 and the 13 inch 2.7 inch MacBook Pro will cost you $300 more at $1499.00. This, as I have noted in the past is a $300 price difference between the two.</p>

<p>Now, if money is not a concern, this is an easy question to answer: Buy the 2.7 inch MacBook Pro, but if you need the cheapest MacBook Pro currently ons sale then the cheap MacBook Pro is the better deal. You might also want to consider adding a warranty option to your MacBook  Pro and  ask yourself: is AppleCare worth it? Some may think the included one year warranty is all they need, while some might say portables demand extented warranty due to all the possibilities of things that can go wrong on your MacBook Pro</p>

<p>**What is your time worth?<br />
**<br />
We also need to consider what you plan on using the MacBook Pro for. If the intended use of the MacBook Pro (and this advice applies to any model) is for business the choice is easy: Buy the 13 inch 2.7MHz MBP. Assuming you keep the MacBook Pro for a year, which is a reasonable time frame to buy and use a new computer, the added cost for the higher end MacBook Pro works out to just pennies per day and not even a dollar a day more. The cost to own the 13 inch MacBook Pro works out to $4.10 per day, so if you make money with your MacBook Pro and it’s more than the measly four bucks, you will be more productive, which results in even more money being made. It would not be hard to make over $4.00 per day with any notebook – Apple or otherwise. I know I do. <img src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p>**What is your MacBook Budget?<br />
**<br />
But, what if you’re a consumer who wants a more powerful, modern and faster computer than the current MacBook lineup that’s getting a bit old and are considering buying a 13 inch MacBook Pro. And even though it is not the cheapest MacBook you can buy you can swing the $200 more for the<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I"> 2.3 GHz model, </a>but when yo consider that you are not using this MacBook Pro for business and more as a portable computer for cafes and the couch, the added $300 on top of the added $200 for the Pro version brings you to $500 more than the MacBook line and with another $500 you could buy two MacBooks or <a href="http:/http://www.ramseeker.com/?p=997">buy a MacBook</a> when you need a full sized keyboard with contemporary design but use that $500 surplus and buy a just released Apple iPad 2 with the same $1500 budget. For the consumer, the choice on what MacBook Pro to buy seems to me to be considerably tougher due to the fact that you have much more choices in how to spend your computer dollars. If you need to buy the cheapest Mac portable, then you should be looking at the MacBook line, but if you can afford it, I would <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/?p=997">buy the 2.3GHz MacBook Pro.</a> Yes, this is the more expensive option but with that extra $200 you get a faster, more modern Apple notebook that at first blush might be the more expensive choice, but you may get more use and enjoyment over time.</p>

<p>Where the current MacBook might indeed be the <strong>cheaper notebook</strong>, it will also age faster and although fast enough for almost every task your average consumer could want, the 13 inch Macbook Pro is the <strong>better MacBook deal</strong> and the MacBook I would buy unless you really cannot afford the extra $200.</p>

<p>What about MacBook Pro screen size?</p>

<p>One other factor to consider when buying a new MacBook Pro is not only price and processor speed – but LCD display size as well. At $1499 the 13 inch MacBook Pro is just $300 away from a <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BNHM0C?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000BNHM0C">15 inch Apple MacBook Pro</a></strong> at $1799, and with that added $300 to the overall cost of the 2.7GHz Macbook Pro 13 inch comes one thing that a lot of users value and that is screen real estate.</p>

<p>Not only do you get a <strong>bigger LCD display</strong> when you <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/">buy a 15 inch MacBook Pro</a>, but you get a bump in processing speed with the 15 inch MacBook Pro offering Intel quad core i7 processors vs the $1499 13 incher’s 2.7Ghz dual core Intel i5 processors. The quad core processors run slower at 2.0 GHz, and not all applications will take advantage of the added cores yet, but if you’re a professional that can uses the MacBook Pro and needs lots of windows open or menus visable, the 15 inch MacBook Pro might allow you to work faster for no other reason than there’s more screen real estate and pixels to use and take advantage of. The cheaper 15 inch MacBook Pro is definitely a MacBook Pro to consider if the 13 inch 2.7 Ghz is also on the list of the MacBook Pros you are considering buying.</p>

<p>To summarize, it’s not an easy decision to choose between the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I">2.3 Ghz</a> and 2.7 inch MacBook Pro when it comes time to buy a new Apple notebook but unless you really need the extra speed the .4 GHz and the 120 GB of extra hard drive space offers, it’s my opinion that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I">2011 2.3GHz 13 inch MacBook Pro </a>is the <strong>best deal on an Apple notebook computer</strong> available today.</p>

All else stays the same as the cheapest MacBook Pro except for the price which is $300 more than the low end model with a MSRP of $1499.</p>

<p>All this is priced at just $1799, which is the suggested list price for the Apple MacBook Pro 15 inch 2.2GHz, but you can get a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BNHM0C?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000BNHM0C">better deal on the MacBook Pro</a> by shopping online from other various online stores for sales and deals as most others offer a bit better price on the 15 inch MacBook Pros than if you were to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BNHM0C?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000BNHM0C">buy a 15 inch MacBook Pro</a> from Apple.</p>

<p>**<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BNHM0C?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000BNHM0C">Apple MacBook Pro 15 inch 2.2GHz<br />
</a> **</p>

<p>The higher end 15 inch MacBook offers a faster processor and runs at 2.2 GHz using the same Intel i7 processor but just a tad faster for power users looking for the fastest 15 inch MacBook Pro Apple makes today. Other features on the 2.2GHz Apple MacBook Pro are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>4GB DDR3 1333MHz Memory</li>
  <li>Intel HD Graphics 3000</li>
  <li>AMD Radeon HD 6750M with 1GB GDDR5</li>
  <li>Built in Battery lasting up to 7 hours</li>
</ol>

<p>The processor is faster, the hard drive is bigger and the graphics card on the high end 15 inch MBP is much faster, and those are the main differences between the 2 MacBook Pro 15 inch models save for the price which is listed as $2199 when you buy a MacBook Pro from Apple, but I you can get a better MacBook Pro 15 inch Price shopping online from other online stores and resources.</p>

<p>The <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002C74D7A?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002C74D7A">17 inch Apple MacBook Pro</a></strong> is for a lot of users, a desktop replacement thanks to the big and bright LCD display that graces the MacBook Pro at the high end of the MBP lineup. The 2.2 GHz is the same speed with the same processor than the 15 inch 2.2 GHz MacBook Pro but the 17 incher offers much more real estate in the screen dept. Priced at another $300 more than the 15 inch model but all other specifications being the same it will be up to you whether you deem the added 2 inches of display space to be worth the extra costs.</p>

<p>Apple has come out with an impressive MacBook Pro lineup, but I’m surprised that the maximum memory is not 16GB on these professional Apple notebooks, as the iMac ha been boasting a 16GB ram maximum for some time now. Perhaps this is on purpose so as not to cannibalize the iMac sales, or more likely the technology or space just isn’t there yet. 8GB ram modules in DDR3 1333Mhz would be cost prohibitive at this point anyway so maybe Apple’s on the right track with this latest MacBook Pro lineup.</p>

<p>**What’s new on all MacBook Pros for 2011<br />
**</p>

<p>A slew of new features across the board make the 2011 Apple MacBook Pros a best buy this year when it comes to the new professional MacBooks:</p>

<p>**Faster Processors<br />
**</p>

<p>Starting with the 13 inch MacBook Pro, the slowest MacBook Pro of the bunch still offer dual core Intel i5 Processors and the 15 inch and 17 inch MacBook Pros offer quad core i7 processors making the the newest Apple MacBooks up to twice as fast as the previous models.</p>

<p>**ThunderBolt<br />
**<br />
Thunderbolt is new technology from Apple introduced first on the MacBook Pro lineup that allows you to use one connector running at up to 10MBps to connect both external peripherals and displays as well, offering less cables and faster speeds when communicating with external devices. USB just got old.</p>

<p>**Faster Graphics<br />
** Newer graphics cards with up to 1GB of RAM eliminate any bottleneck in the processing of graphics. Perfect for grapics professionals such as those using Aperture 3 or Adobe Photoshop.</p>

<p>**HD Face Time<br />
**</p>

<p>Face Time, Apple’s full screen video call technology goes HD that are sharper and more crisp than the video produced in previous MacBook Pro models</p>

<p>Included when you buy any new MacBook Pro model in 2011 is the MacBook Pro portable computer, the Magsafe Power Adapter, wall plug and power cord and included software dvds and a display polishing cloth to keep your new MacBook Display like the day you bought it.</p>

<p>Lastly the MacBook Pro models, regardless of screen size come with Mac OS Snow Leopard and iLife ’11 which includes iPhoto, iMove, GarageBand, iWeb and iDVD which all allow you to control, create and discover your photos, movies, and music on Apple’s new MacBook Pro professional notebook computers.</p>

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p> <br />
I am now tracking and monitoring memory upgrade prices for the new Apple MacBook Pro models released today and as I write this there are just two memory stores who ship and stock RAM upgrades for the 2011 Apple MacBook Pros. Seeing as how the new MacBook Pro models were released just a few hours ago that the two memory stores that tend to specialize in Apple memory are the first to announce and list memory prices online for the new Apple MacBook Pro Models, those two memory sellers being <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/ramjet">RAMJET</a> and OWC.<br />
[table id=1 /]<strong>Update</strong>: I have added memory prices for MacBook Pro 2011 RAM prices for the newest MacBook Pro models from the the following memory stores: <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">Crucial Technology,</a> <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/dms">Data Memory Systems</a> and <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memoryx">MemoryX</a></p>

<div>
</div>

<p>I have created two pages for the 2011 MacBook Pro’s as like always over the years if you’re in the market for the best prices on MacBook Pro RAM you need to check for both <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_Pro_DDR3_1333Mhz_Memory_Upgrades-4gb/">4GB MacBook Pro DDR3 Memory Modules</a> as well as <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_Pro_DDR3_1333Mhz_Memory_Upgrade_Kits-8gb/">8GB MacBook Pro Memory Upgrade Kits</a> as some stores only ship modules and others carry only the kits so be sure to check both for the best deal on 2011 MacBook Pro Memory Upgrades.</p>

<p>I’m surprised Apple didn’t bump the maximum memory on the 2011 MacBook Pros to a maximum of 16GB as this is what the new Apple iMacs can handle for almost a year now so I really assumed that 16GB of RAM for the MacBook Pros would be the default.</p>

<p>The new DDR3 MacBook Pro RAM for the 2011 MacBook Pros is compatible with the current Apple MacBook Computers and that’s for all versions – 13 inch to 17 inch models.</p>

The day of the release of the new MacBook Pro, Ramjet is the first memory vendor to offer the compatible DDR3-1333 RAM upgrades. Two upgrade options are available. The 4GB single SO-DIMM upgrades the MacBook Pro to 6GB, and an 8GB Kit (2x 4GB modules) which brings the MacBook up to its 8GB memory maximum.</p>

<p>The prices are significantly lower than the Apple price, with the <a href="http://www.ramjet.com/macbook.asp#BlackBezel" title="macbook memory">4GB module at $89.99,</a> and the <a href="http://www.ramjet.com/macbook.asp#BlackBezel" title="8GB macbook pro RAM">8GB kit at $149.99</a>. There is also a $40 trade-in rebate for the original 4GB that comes with the machine, which brings the total cost down to $109.99 for the 8GB upgrade.</p>

<p>All <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/ramjet" title="ramjet memory for macbook">Ramjet memory</a> comes with a lifetime warranty. Modules are in stock, available for immediate shipment.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2011/01/when-will-i-be-able-to-buy-an-under-700-ultrabook/">When Will I Be Able To Buy An Under $700 Ultrabook?</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p><strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/acers3.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4100" title="acers3 deal" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/acers3.jpg" alt="best deal on Acer S3" width="300" height="300" /></a><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/save-100-off-an-acer-s3-ultrabook/" title="Save $100 off an Acer S3 UltraBook">A deal on an Acer ultrabook  I found today</a></strong> reminded me of  a question I wanted to ask, and that’s <strong>when you think we will see a small portable computer with similar features of the  Apple MacBook  Air, but for about half the price</strong>? My guess is in about six months or so from now, maybe in time for back to school in 2012.</p>

<p>Let’s face it. If you want to buy the<strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/pc/541966/?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957"> best computer online today you buy an Apple notebook</a></strong>.  If you don’t believe me, just have a look at the best selling notebooks at Amazon where 7 out of ten best sellers in the laptop department are Apple notebooks –  not windows PC’s.</p>

<p>But for the rest of us who actually work for every penny we spend, the opportunity to buy an Ultrabook at half the price of an Apple product is too great to ignore for some of us. At least it is for yours truly. I would love to buy a brand  new 2012 Apple MacBook  Air  if and when they are released but when you can get pretty much the same computer capable of the same tasks for half the price, one  might argue in favor of the Windows machine.</p>

<p><strong>UltraBooks Cost Too Much</strong></p>

<p>The problem with the first generation ultrabooks, and to some extent some of  the new 2012 ultra’s, is that at current retail prices they are too close to the price of an Apple MacBook Air for me to be willing to put up with the Windows experience when  can buy a MacBook Air for about the same dough.</p>

<p>For a comparison of Ultrabooks vs MacBook Air’s, I am not going to compare every last detail as there are differnces in the technical specs, but in my mind there’s two reasons to buy this new brand of notebook computer: size and weight, and hard drive speed thanks to the solid state hard drives included in these.</p>

<p>A 13.3. inch Apple Ultrabook costs just over $1100 on sale at Amazon and  the <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005MR58MG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B005MR58MG">Acer Aspire S3 costs $799</a></strong> from a variety of online vendors  including Amazon.</p>

<p>The Air has features the S3 doesn’t have but they both offer SSD hard drives and light weight at about 3lbs each. The difference for the  most part is operating system and $300. As I write this, I might be tempted to go with the MacBook Air  – assuming I can find the price difference.</p>

<p>Unless I really needed to buy an UltraBook today, I would wait until we see a half price ultrabook. By half price, I don’t mean half the pric of regular price, but at a price point where I can buy two ultrabooks for the price  of one MacBook Air and currently that means there has to be a $550 Ultrabook for these lightweight windows notebooks to really take off.</p>

<p>To be fair, it’s hard to buy a full featured notebook for that price, so let’s offer a little wiggle room and say that for me  to  buy a PC ultrabook over a MacBook Air  the ultrabooks need to drop  in price to the $500-$700 range. All that’s stopping them is the cost of the solid state drive, and with SSD drives continuing to fall it’s just a matter of  time before this happens.</p>

<p>We’re off to a good start with a $100 off Ultrabooks startin to appear, we just need to see the prices drop another hundred dollars at least for these small notebooks to start selling in quantity.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2011/01/cheap-macbook-ram/">Cheap Mac RAM for Apple MacBook Computers</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com">MacBook memory,</a> or MacBook RAM as it is commonly known is in my opinion the very best upgrade you can do on an Apple MacBook. It’s a better upgrade than hard drives, or even software and the best part is that in 2011 MacBook RAM is cheap, in fact, cheaper than it’s ever been in years. Only a few short months ago to max out the ram on a MacBook would cost upwards of one hundred dollars, but now in earkly 2011 the very same DDR3 ram upgrade consisting of a 4GB MacBook RAM kit can be bought for as little as $48.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1136" title="Best Price MacBook Pro" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-24-at-7.39.14-AM.png" alt="See Best Price on MacBook Pro" width="283" height="223" /></a></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I">Cheapest MacBook Pro: 13 Inch MacBook Pro</a></strong></p>

<p>The MacBook lineup has been refreshed by Apple over the years but the same design hasn’t changed much and the MacBook only accepts two different types of memory upgrades: For older MacBook models such as the Intel Core Processor MacBooks and even some Intel Core 2 processor MacBooks the memory required for these older MacBook model are DDR2 PC5300 DDR sodimms and although not required, it’s recommended that you install the MacBook Memory in pairs.</p>

<p>Some memory vendors suggest that more memory than Apple suggests can be installed in a MacBook and it may very be possible, I recommend you stick to what the maximum RAM for MacBook as suggested by Apple.. For older MacBooks requiring DDR2 RAM that max out at 2GB of memory, it has been suggested that 3GB of RAM will run fine in these Apple notebooks and for those MacBooks that max out at 4GB, it’s been suggested that 6GB of memory will run fine. This could be the case, as when the older MacBooks were released, the larger 2GB and 4GB memory chips were not available.</p>

<p>For the newer UniBody MacBook models, these run a faster motherboard speed at twice as fast as the older MacBooks and require DDR3 memory upgrades running at 1066Mhz. The newer MacBook models max out at 4GB of DDR3 RAM which is more than enough memory for most applications.</p>

<p>Buying MacBook Memory is a fine balance: You can buy the MacBook RAM directly from Apple either when you buy the MacBook, or you can purchase memory from Apple at a later date. Warranty will be no problem as you have Apple memory installed in an Apple product. But, and this is big: RAM from Apple will not be cheap.</p>

<p>What I suggest is buying ram for MacBooks from a trusted third party vendor that offer the same warranty and support as with Apple products, but without the inflated price tag that comes with the RAM when you buy from Apple directly.</p>

<p>Memory for MacBook can either be the cheapest MacBook RAM you can buy, or if you prefer you can spend a few more dollars and buy name brand memory from a vendor such as Crucial Technology. When shopping for RAM, the cheapest RAM is going to be generic RAM, which for most applications is just fine and still manufactured and tested to the Apple Specifications that the MacBook requires when it comes to RAM upgrades.</p>

<p>**Cheapest MacBook RAM Prices<br />
**<br />
I have created a table or chart of the cheapest MacBook RAM prices from a select few memory stores I can recommend that sell a quality memory product at a fair price: This list of MacBook memory prices change so you will always be sure to get the best prices on RAM for MacBook, regardless of what specific MacBook you have.</p>

<p>There was a time when Apple just had one product  and that was the Apple Macintosh computer, but with the Mac now available in so many different flavors not to mention tablet computers like the Apple iPad and MP3 players such as the iPod – the selection can be a bit overwhelming for both the Brand New Apple computer user and professional alike.</p>

		<div class="post-content"><p>Cheapest Mac Pro RAM Prices.</p>

<p>Below are the current and cheapest prices on Mac Pro Memory from a wide selection of memory stores that you can trust to get a good deal on Mac Pro Memory.</p>

<p>[table id=15 /]</p>

<p>Cheap Mac Pro RAM (or, Mac Pro Memory) may not be the best deal on Mac Pro RAM as you think it might be if you set the value of cheap just on price alone. I know, I compare prices on Mac Pro memory so this might seem as if I am contradicting myself, but all I have done and continue to do is look for the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com">best Mac Pro RAM Prices</a>. I never really suggest that you buy Mac Pro RAM from one vendor or another as I feel it’s your hard earned money so you get to decide where to buy Mac Pro Memory.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ZR4M6I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B003ZR4M6I">Cheapest Mac Pro</a></strong></p>

<p>But Cheap RAM for Mac Pros should not be the only requirement for shopping for Mac Pro memory upgrades. The Apple Mac Pro is not a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fbestsellers%2Fpc%2F565098%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref_%3Dpd_ts_zgc_pc_565098_mor1&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">cheap computer</a> and in fact, it’s the most expensive desktop Mac you can buy and when it comes to ram upgrades for Apple Mac Pros, the RAM is anything but cheap.</p>

<p>That said, in the six months or so since the latest Apple Mac Pros were released (we’ll call them mid 2010 models) you can now install up to 64GB of RAM into the latest Mac Pro models and Mac Pro memory prices have dropped significantly over the past six months. Case in point – 64GB of Mac Pro RAM in the summer of 2010 would cost you just over $3000. Today in early 2011, that same memory upgrade from the same memory store costs as little as $1800. That’s getting close to half price for Mac Pro memory in just a few months.</p>

<p>If you need more memory to get work done, then buy ram now and be happy that you have the fastest Mac Pro possible (assuming you are maxing out your Mac Pro with 64GB) and don’t worry about the cost. The cheapest RAM or savings from buying the cheapest RAM may sound like a good deal on memory but you might be better off with name brand ram or at very least buying Mac Pro Memory from a memory store you can trust.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2011/01/cheap-mac-mini-ram/">Cheap Mac Mini RAM</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>To get the maximum performance out of the Mac Mini, you can and should install more RAM in the Mac Mini (here’s the instructions from Apple on <a href="http://manuals.info.apple.com/en_US/Mac_mini_Mid2010_User_Guide.pdf">how to install Mac Mini RAM</a>) you want page 34. You can install 8GB of DDR3 1066 SDRAM in the latest Apple Mac Mini and I recommend that you do as Mac Mini RAM is cheap, in fact memory upgrades for any Apple Computer is a great deal right now and the cheapest it’s been is some time. Now is the time to buy ram. regardless of whether it’s for The Mac Mini, any other Mac or even a PC such as a HP notebook computer.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013FK9U2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0013FK9U2">Cheapest Mac Mini</a></strong>The Apple Mac Mini is the <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013FK9U2?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0013FK9U2">cheapest Apple computer</a></strong> you can buy in 2011. (and, it’s on sale too). But one thing that will make this little wonder even better would be to max out the memory on the Apple Mac Mini.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Installing the RAM on the newest Mac Mini couldn’t be easier – all you do is flip the Mac Mini over, twist the cover like you would on a jar of peanut butter and the RAM and memory slots are right there. Apple does suggest that you have an Apple certified technician install the memory upgrade on a Mac Mini but I don’t think that’s needed at all if you’re careful with static electricity you should be fine. But be aware that if something does go wrong installin memory by yourself, your warranty on your new Mac Mini could be voided.</p>

<p>To remove the original RAM on a Mac Mini, there’s two little clips that hold the memory module down – seperate these and the memory module pops up at a 45 degree angle (or thereabouts) and you gently remove the memory from the memory upgrade slot. You repeat this for the second memory upgrade module that’s directly below and then you have to empty memory upgrade slots that are now free to use 4GB DDR3 SDRAM x 2 to get you to the maximum of 8GB of memory allowed on the latest Mac Mini models. (older mac mini’s were not as easy to install memory in, so if you’re in the market for RAM for a discontinued Mac Mini you might be best to find either an apple certified technician to install the memory for you, or if the warranty on the Mac Mini is long gone you might want to chance installing the RAM yourself.</p>

<p><strong>Where to Buy Mac Mini RAM Cheap</strong></p>

<p>As I mentioned above, Mac mini ram is the cheapest it’s ever been and you can buy much cheaper RAM from a selection of memory stores that I can recommend as being quality places to buy memory from. Below is a chart of the current <strong>best and cheapest ram for Apple Mac Mini</strong>.</p>

<p>The iMac, in my opinion is probably the best value in an Apple Personal Computer, regardless of year. From the very first Apple iMac to the current Apple iMacs with Intel i3 and i5 processors, with the Apple iMac you get a well designed desktop computer that in it’s latest incarnation with the summer 2010 refresh also offers you a choice of processor speeds, screen sizes and price points but they all offer the same sleek design that hardly takes any room on your desktop.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8IO6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8IO6">Cheapest Apple iMac</a></strong></p>

<p>One thing that the latest iMacs need (and with RAM so cheap these days, I don’t understand why Apple doesn’t ship the Apple iMac’s full of RAM) is more RAM. For a select few, the memory installed at the factory will be more than ample if you’re just surfing facebook or email or the like, but for the rest of us that want to get the most performance we can out of Apple’s best selling desktop computer, adding more memory is the cheapest way to do that and usually offers more bang per buck than adding hard drives or installing software could.</p>

<p>The best part about iMac memory upgrades, is that if you do it right you only do it once and the memory upgrade is good for the life of the computer. Fill your iMac with RAM, and forget about it. You can buy ram from Apple for the iMac, but even though more moderately priced than earlier years buying RAM direct from Apple is still a pricey proposition.</p>

<p>A better, and cheaper option is to buy iMac Memory from a memory store you can trust to offer the same technical specs required for the 2010 Apple iMacs but at a cheaper price. Most memory stores offer a lifetime guarantee free shipping and support in the rare case you do have trouble with your iMac RAM you know you will get the help you need. This is rarely needed as the memory shops test the RAM upgrades prior to shipping.</p>

<p>**Where to Buy iMac RAM and for the Cheapest Price.<br />
**</p>

<p>I don’t recommend any one specific memory store as I figure it’s your money you’re spending and you have different requirements about how much you will pay for ram, but also the perceived value attached with <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">brand name memory</a> and other factors to consider when buying RAM. But, most of you just want the cheapest iMac RAM and I have created a chart that lists the lowest memory prices from memory vendors you can trust.</p>
