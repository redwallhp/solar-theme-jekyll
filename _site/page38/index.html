The Apple MacBook Pro 13 inch is the [best selling notebook today][1]

You know, as we enter 2011 I&#8217;m beginning to wonder the same thing as for what I do here on ramseeker &#8211; **could  my MacBook could easily be replaced by a much cheaper windows PC?** I&#8217;ve had a notebook PC for a few years now where it&#8217;s served as an underused and underappreciated iTunes music server, but as recent as just last evening I began to wonder if I could do what I do on a much cheaper windows PC instead?

The  13 inch MacBook Pro is the **[newest and most popular notebook on sale][1]** today, so there&#8217;s lots and lots of Apple fans that would much rather pay for the Apple brand  and there are a few reasons why in the long term the **Apple Mac might be the better buy**.

**The Mac Operating System**

The Mac/PC ads that were so popular both on TV and online a few years back featuring Justin Lon and John Hodgman highlighted the advantages of the Apple software, and  when it comes to innovation I think Apple gets the nod. Apple tends to lead the way with newer technology than Windows. The Mac OS tends to be, admittedly from a Mac-centric perspective, more intuitive.

**More Built in Software**

Or maybe better designed built in software might be a better way to state this. The included apps such as iLife, Garage Band, iMovie and the like tend to get better over the years and are also upgraded every year. There&#8217;s also iTunes which is software not for downloading  and playing music but Apple computers tend to work seamlessly with other Apple products such as iPods and iPhones.

**The Mac is Virus Free**

Somebody&#8217;s  going to chime in on this I know, but I&#8217;ve never been wiped out by viruses in the many many years I have owned and loved Apple computers. This may be the deal breaker right here, as with Windows you have to add and renew expensive antivirus software programs to be virus free. My Apple Macs have always just worked from the day I took them out of the box to the days I have sold or upgraded my Macs. When it comes to Macs they just worked for me.

I guess it all comes down to  what you do and how important your computing needs are. If all you do is facebook and email, then any old windows PC and most smartphones today are up  to the task. With the Macs, you pay more up front  &#8211; as much as triple the costs of a windows PC,  but it&#8217;s my opinion you get a better built and thought out product that&#8217;s more intuitive to use. But the downside of this is you&#8217;ll pay for it up front, and if you don&#8217;t have the cash then perhaps you should consider **[buying a windows PC][1]**.

**Your Mac Will Tell You What Memory You Need.**

But, all joking aside it&#8217;s pretty easy to figure out what memory you need for your 2010 MacBook Pro (or any Apple computer, now that I think of it).You could always [ask me][1]. <img src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

In the top left corner of your Apple MacBook 2010 is a little Apple logo, that if you click it you will see a menu item called **About This Mac**. It&#8217;s the very first menu item you see when you select the Apple Menu, so it&#8217;s pretty easy to find. After you have selected the menu, up pops a window that looks similar to this:  
[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1713" title="Apple Menu " src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Screen-shot-2011-04-14-at-3.08.10-PM.png" alt="How to Find Mac Memory" width="311" height="385" />][2]

On this menu, you will see that it will tell you what version of the Mac OS you are running,  what your processor speed is and how much and what type of speed memory you have already installed in your MacBook Pro. In my  case, I already have the maximum macbook memory installed as I&#8217;m typing this on  a 2008 MacBook Pro, and at the time, 4GB of RAM was a lot of memory (how times change)

The more info button will bring up the system profiler which will tell you that you&#8217;ve got two memory upgade chips installed and some other technical jargon that, in my opinion you don&#8217;t need &#8211; as you now have all the data you need &#8211; you know your MacBook Pro processor speed, memory type and speed and how much ram you already have installed.

Now all you need is to find a memory store that will help you find the right ram for your MacBook Pro. I&#8217;ve got a [great list of memory stores][3] here but for this example I will use **[crucial technology][2]** as they offer fair prices on ram and  have an easy to use memory upgrade finder.

Off we go to **[Crucial][2]**, where we select our Computer Manufacturer, Model Name, and processor speed  &#8211; all things your Mac already told you you have, and  you&#8217;re returned with information about your particular model such as memory type for your MacBook Pro (which we already know) and how many slots  and the maximum RAM your MacBook Pro can recognize, stuff we didn&#8217;t know.

If my MacBook Pro only had 2GB of RAM installed, I now know that I could max out my RAM on my MacBook Pro by replacing the 2x1GB memory upgrades with bigger memory modules, and  in this example that would be two 2GB memory modules for MacBook Pro which would maximize the RAM in my particular Apple MacBook Pro.

And once you have bought your MacBook Pro RAM Upgrade, it&#8217;s easy to install the MacBook memory yourself with common household tools that will not void your warranty. You can find how to upgrade your Apple RAM from Apple as **[Macbook Pro Memory Upgrade instructions][4]** are included in the manual that came with your MacBook Pro.

It&#8217;s that easy to find the right memory for your MacBook Pro.

<br>

		<div class="post-content">I tend to pay more attention to the 2010 Apple iMacs, as that&#8217;s where you will get the most bang for your buck as the older iMacs might be so low in value that it&#8217;s not worth it to add more RAM to your iMac and you might be better off just selling your old iMac on eBay or Craigslist and buying a new iMac altogether if the memory upgrades end up costing you more than your Apple iMac is worth, it might be something to consider.

**Which iMac Do You Need To Buy Memory For?**Where to buy iMac memory depends on many variables including whether you value the best price on ram you can get, or maybe you don&#8217;t mind paying more for iMac RAM and are willing to spend more on name brand ram, such as Crucial or Kingston RAM. But whatever you decide &#8211; cheap RAM for iMac, or the more pricier stuff &#8211; there&#8217;s one thing you have to determine first and that is:

**How To Tell What Apple iMac RAM You Need To Buy**

&nbsp;

**[Best iMac RAM on Sale][1]**

There&#8217;s many ways to do this and some [memory sellers][2] even offer a small application you can download that will help you find the right iMac Memory you need, or if you know the speed of the computer you need to upgrade you may have enough info to use the memory configurator the ram stores offer.

One way to determine what RAM you need to buy for any Mac, and not just Apple iMacs is to use the good old Apple Menu to tell you: In the top left corner of your Mac is About This Mac, and when you select this menu item a window pops up that tells me what speed my current iMac is running at:

An example, although not an Apple iMac is my MacBook Pro which uses 1066 DDR3 SDRAM DIMMS:

You will see I am using a 2.4Ghz MacBook Pro that already has 4GB  of DDR3 RAM installed which is in this case, the maximum RAM I can run, but also  you now have the processor speed  and memory type and speed for your Apple computer.

**Where to Buy Apple  iMac RAM**

[table id=2 /]

Armed with this information you&#8217;re now ready to shop at **[any number of memory stores][3]** where you can use the search function or memory configurator functions to find the right memory upgrades for your Apple iMac, as you now know what speed your iMac runs at as well as how fast the RAM  is for your iMac &#8211; two critical factors to determine when **[buying RAM for iMac][4]**.

<br>

		<div class="post-content">You know, these days almost &#8211; and the key word here is almost, any RAM you buy today for the iMac that meets the specifications f0r your Apple iMac will work and do the trick so you don&#8217;t really need a review on memory, as it either works or it doesn&#8217;t. There&#8217;s not a whole lot of gray when it comes to RAM (lots of gray market memory though, and you do want to stay away from memory stores that offer questionable RAM) as it either works just fine, or it doesn&#8217;t

**[Kingston 8GB Memory Upgrade. The Best iMac RAM Today][1]**

**[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1684" title="Best Deal on iMac Memory" alt="Best Selling iMac RAM today" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Screen-shot-2011-04-11-at-12.28.37-PM.png" width="308" height="292" />][2]**

**How To Determine the Right iMac RAM To Buy**

Apple iMac RAM comes in many sizes from 1GB (actually 32mb and up, but any iMac worth upgrading today probably requires at least 1GB of RAM to run today&#8217;s Apple OS and Apple Applications smoothly) all the way up to 16GB on the 2010 iMacs, and look for even greater ram capacities on newer 2011 Apple iMacs that although they have not been released yet, will be sure to be here this summer or spring and my guess is they will take more than the 16GB maximum RAM that the iMacs currently run.

One of the easiest methods to determine the correct memory for your iMac is to use the Apple Menu to tell you both the processor speed of your current Apple iMac and also the speed the memory runs at, which for current 2010 (still current in 2011) Apple iMac is DDR3 SDRAM sodimms running at 1333Mhz.

**Apple iMac Memory Choices**  
[table id=2 /]

iMac memory &#8211;  regardless of brand name, or even where you buy it from, which I will get to in a minute comes in essentially two flavors. One, is the name brand ram and at time of writing this up Kingston RAM for iMac seems to be the best selling iMac memory you can buy today and 8GB will cost you under $100. But, there&#8217;s other choices too such as Crucial Memory, another well respected  iMac memory brand.

Or, if you want to save even more money  on RAM  you can buy Generic RAM from a **[selection of memory stores][3] **that offer better prices on iMac RAM, s  these stores for the most part sell only Generic RAM. This RAM brand, or lack of brand really is still a tested high quality memory upgrade, but it&#8217;s made in house by  some memory stores,  or bought in bulk where the savings on ram upgrades can be passed on to you &#8211; the consumer. This type of RAM is cheaper as there is no logo or sticker on the memory  upgrade and in my experience ships in a small plain envelope which costs less than the fancy packaging the name brand RAM is supplied in.

**Summary**

All RAM for iMac will work just fine, but at the  time I write this the best selling and most popular iMac memory upgrade is the **[8GB Kingston Brand DDR3 for Apple iMac][1]** memory upgrade kit priced under $100.
