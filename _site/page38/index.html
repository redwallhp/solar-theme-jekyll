<p>You know, as we enter 2011 I’m beginning to wonder the same thing as for what I do here on ramseeker – <strong>could  my MacBook could easily be replaced by a much cheaper windows PC?</strong> I’ve had a notebook PC for a few years now where it’s served as an underused and underappreciated iTunes music server, but as recent as just last evening I began to wonder if I could do what I do on a much cheaper windows PC instead?</p>

<p>The  13 inch MacBook Pro is the <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26scn%3D565108%26redirect%3Dtrue%26ref_%3Dsr_nr_scat_565108_ln%26keywords%3Dwindows%2520pc%26qid%3D1302792487%26h%3Dc7bb7aa435747f968b60d8f3daa0430828b78469%26rh%3Dn%253A565108%252Ck%253Awindows%2520pc&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">newest and most popular notebook on sale</a></strong> today, so there’s lots and lots of Apple fans that would much rather pay for the Apple brand  and there are a few reasons why in the long term the <strong>Apple Mac might be the better buy</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>The Mac Operating System</strong></p>

<p>The Mac/PC ads that were so popular both on TV and online a few years back featuring Justin Lon and John Hodgman highlighted the advantages of the Apple software, and  when it comes to innovation I think Apple gets the nod. Apple tends to lead the way with newer technology than Windows. The Mac OS tends to be, admittedly from a Mac-centric perspective, more intuitive.</p>

<p><strong>More Built in Software</strong></p>

<p>Or maybe better designed built in software might be a better way to state this. The included apps such as iLife, Garage Band, iMovie and the like tend to get better over the years and are also upgraded every year. There’s also iTunes which is software not for downloading  and playing music but Apple computers tend to work seamlessly with other Apple products such as iPods and iPhones.</p>

<p><strong>The Mac is Virus Free</strong></p>

<p>Somebody’s  going to chime in on this I know, but I’ve never been wiped out by viruses in the many many years I have owned and loved Apple computers. This may be the deal breaker right here, as with Windows you have to add and renew expensive antivirus software programs to be virus free. My Apple Macs have always just worked from the day I took them out of the box to the days I have sold or upgraded my Macs. When it comes to Macs they just worked for me.</p>

<p>I guess it all comes down to  what you do and how important your computing needs are. If all you do is facebook and email, then any old windows PC and most smartphones today are up  to the task. With the Macs, you pay more up front  – as much as triple the costs of a windows PC,  but it’s my opinion you get a better built and thought out product that’s more intuitive to use. But the downside of this is you’ll pay for it up front, and if you don’t have the cash then perhaps you should consider <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26scn%3D565108%26redirect%3Dtrue%26ref_%3Dsr_nr_scat_565108_ln%26keywords%3Dwindows%2520pc%26qid%3D1302792487%26h%3Dc7bb7aa435747f968b60d8f3daa0430828b78469%26rh%3Dn%253A565108%252Ck%253Awindows%2520pc&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">buying a windows PC</a></strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Your Mac Will Tell You What Memory You Need.</strong></p>

<p>But, all joking aside it’s pretty easy to figure out what memory you need for your 2010 MacBook Pro (or any Apple computer, now that I think of it).You could always <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/contact">ask me</a>. <img src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p>In the top left corner of your Apple MacBook 2010 is a little Apple logo, that if you click it you will see a menu item called <strong>About This Mac</strong>. It’s the very first menu item you see when you select the Apple Menu, so it’s pretty easy to find. After you have selected the menu, up pops a window that looks similar to this:<br />
<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1713" title="Apple Menu " src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Screen-shot-2011-04-14-at-3.08.10-PM.png" alt="How to Find Mac Memory" width="311" height="385" /></a></p>

<p>On this menu, you will see that it will tell you what version of the Mac OS you are running,  what your processor speed is and how much and what type of speed memory you have already installed in your MacBook Pro. In my  case, I already have the maximum macbook memory installed as I’m typing this on  a 2008 MacBook Pro, and at the time, 4GB of RAM was a lot of memory (how times change)</p>

<p>The more info button will bring up the system profiler which will tell you that you’ve got two memory upgade chips installed and some other technical jargon that, in my opinion you don’t need – as you now have all the data you need – you know your MacBook Pro processor speed, memory type and speed and how much ram you already have installed.</p>

<p>Now all you need is to find a memory store that will help you find the right ram for your MacBook Pro. I’ve got a <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/where-to-buy-computer-memory-upgrades/" title="memory store list">great list of memory stores</a> here but for this example I will use <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">crucial technology</a></strong> as they offer fair prices on ram and  have an easy to use memory upgrade finder.</p>

<p>Off we go to <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">Crucial</a></strong>, where we select our Computer Manufacturer, Model Name, and processor speed  – all things your Mac already told you you have, and  you’re returned with information about your particular model such as memory type for your MacBook Pro (which we already know) and how many slots  and the maximum RAM your MacBook Pro can recognize, stuff we didn’t know.</p>

<p>If my MacBook Pro only had 2GB of RAM installed, I now know that I could max out my RAM on my MacBook Pro by replacing the 2x1GB memory upgrades with bigger memory modules, and  in this example that would be two 2GB memory modules for MacBook Pro which would maximize the RAM in my particular Apple MacBook Pro.</p>

<p>And once you have bought your MacBook Pro RAM Upgrade, it’s easy to install the MacBook memory yourself with common household tools that will not void your warranty. You can find how to upgrade your Apple RAM from Apple as <strong><a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1270" title="how to install apple ram">Macbook Pro Memory Upgrade instructions</a></strong> are included in the manual that came with your MacBook Pro.</p>

<p>It’s that easy to find the right memory for your MacBook Pro.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2011/04/where-to-buy-memory-for-imac/">Where to Buy Memory for iMac?</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>I tend to pay more attention to the 2010 Apple iMacs, as that’s where you will get the most bang for your buck as the older iMacs might be so low in value that it’s not worth it to add more RAM to your iMac and you might be better off just selling your old iMac on eBay or Craigslist and buying a new iMac altogether if the memory upgrades end up costing you more than your Apple iMac is worth, it might be something to consider.</p>

<p><strong>Which iMac Do You Need To Buy Memory For?</strong>Where to buy iMac memory depends on many variables including whether you value the best price on ram you can get, or maybe you don’t mind paying more for iMac RAM and are willing to spend more on name brand ram, such as Crucial or Kingston RAM. But whatever you decide – cheap RAM for iMac, or the more pricier stuff – there’s one thing you have to determine first and that is:</p>

<p><strong>How To Tell What Apple iMac RAM You Need To Buy</strong></p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW">Best iMac RAM on Sale</a></strong></p>

<p>There’s many ways to do this and some <a href="http://www.memoryseller.com">memory sellers</a> even offer a small application you can download that will help you find the right iMac Memory you need, or if you know the speed of the computer you need to upgrade you may have enough info to use the memory configurator the ram stores offer.</p>

<p>One way to determine what RAM you need to buy for any Mac, and not just Apple iMacs is to use the good old Apple Menu to tell you: In the top left corner of your Mac is About This Mac, and when you select this menu item a window pops up that tells me what speed my current iMac is running at:</p>

<p>An example, although not an Apple iMac is my MacBook Pro which uses 1066 DDR3 SDRAM DIMMS:</p>

<p>You will see I am using a 2.4Ghz MacBook Pro that already has 4GB  of DDR3 RAM installed which is in this case, the maximum RAM I can run, but also  you now have the processor speed  and memory type and speed for your Apple computer.</p>

<p><strong>Where to Buy Apple  iMac RAM</strong></p>

<p>[table id=2 /]</p>

<p>Armed with this information you’re now ready to shop at <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/where-to-buy-computer-memory-upgrades/" title="where to buy apple memory">any number of memory stores</a></strong> where you can use the search function or memory configurator functions to find the right memory upgrades for your Apple iMac, as you now know what speed your iMac runs at as well as how fast the RAM  is for your iMac – two critical factors to determine when <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">buying RAM for iMac</a></strong>.</p>

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>You know, these days almost – and the key word here is almost, any RAM you buy today for the iMac that meets the specifications f0r your Apple iMac will work and do the trick so you don’t really need a review on memory, as it either works or it doesn’t. There’s not a whole lot of gray when it comes to RAM (lots of gray market memory though, and you do want to stay away from memory stores that offer questionable RAM) as it either works just fine, or it doesn’t</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW">Kingston 8GB Memory Upgrade. The Best iMac RAM Today</a></strong></p>

<p><strong>How To Determine the Right iMac RAM To Buy</strong></p>

<p>Apple iMac RAM comes in many sizes from 1GB (actually 32mb and up, but any iMac worth upgrading today probably requires at least 1GB of RAM to run today’s Apple OS and Apple Applications smoothly) all the way up to 16GB on the 2010 iMacs, and look for even greater ram capacities on newer 2011 Apple iMacs that although they have not been released yet, will be sure to be here this summer or spring and my guess is they will take more than the 16GB maximum RAM that the iMacs currently run.</p>

<p>One of the easiest methods to determine the correct memory for your iMac is to use the Apple Menu to tell you both the processor speed of your current Apple iMac and also the speed the memory runs at, which for current 2010 (still current in 2011) Apple iMac is DDR3 SDRAM sodimms running at 1333Mhz.</p>

<p><strong>Apple iMac Memory Choices</strong><br />
[table id=2 /]</p>

<p>iMac memory –  regardless of brand name, or even where you buy it from, which I will get to in a minute comes in essentially two flavors. One, is the name brand ram and at time of writing this up Kingston RAM for iMac seems to be the best selling iMac memory you can buy today and 8GB will cost you under $100. But, there’s other choices too such as Crucial Memory, another well respected  iMac memory brand.</p>

<p>Or, if you want to save even more money  on RAM  you can buy Generic RAM from a **<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/where-to-buy-computer-memory-upgrades/">selection of memory stores</a> **that offer better prices on iMac RAM, s  these stores for the most part sell only Generic RAM. This RAM brand, or lack of brand really is still a tested high quality memory upgrade, but it’s made in house by  some memory stores,  or bought in bulk where the savings on ram upgrades can be passed on to you – the consumer. This type of RAM is cheaper as there is no logo or sticker on the memory  upgrade and in my experience ships in a small plain envelope which costs less than the fancy packaging the name brand RAM is supplied in.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>All RAM for iMac will work just fine, but at the  time I write this the best selling and most popular iMac memory upgrade is the <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW">8GB Kingston Brand DDR3 for Apple iMac</a></strong> memory upgrade kit priced under $100.</p>

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p> </p>

<div style="float: right; margin-right: 5px;">
  It&#8217;s been said in the computing field there&#8217;s no such thing as too much ram or hard drive space, and it&#8217;s so true. As our need for both hard drive space and memory increases over the years (it wasn&#8217;t that long ago that 250gb of hard drive space was a big deal, as so was 1GB of memory upgrade space)
</div>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0039SM0AS/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0039SM0AS"><img title="Cheap Solid State Hard Drives" alt="Cheap Drives, Solid State. " src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Screen-shot-2011-04-11-at-2.58.01-PM.png" width="241" height="179" /></a></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0039SM0AS/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0039SM0AS">Solid Sate Hard Drives for MacBook</a></strong></p>

<p>But times change and before you know it, the hard drive on your MacBook is full, or getting there thanks to the demands of modern computing such as MP3 and movie downloads , not to mention the bloated operating systems that despite the fact offer more speed and functionality and are much more intuititive than OS’s of before – these software programs take up a lot of space, and usually more space than what you what came with the hard drive installed inside your Apple notebook computer.</p>

<p><strong>MacBook Hard Drives are Cheap</strong></p>

<p>The good news is that not only are MacBook hard drives offer more capacity at less money than ever before, if you install your original factory hard drive in and external case (usually a USB case), then you now have an instant backup of your MacBook and in most cases – for traditional SATA hard drives, the hard drives cost under $100.</p>

<p>Another option when considering a MacBook hard drive upgrade is to keep your factory hard drive in an external hard drive case as mentioned before, but instead of buying a standard hard drive, buy a cheap solid state hard drive for startup files and regularly accessed files and use your original MacBook hard drive for stuff you don’t use as much.</p>

<p>**Cheap Hard Drives for MacBook. **</p>

<p>As the MacBook ships from Apple with a 250GB hard drive you, in my opinion at least want to double your MacBook hard drive space so starting with the **Western Digital Scorpion Blue 500GB internal SATA hard **drive that’s currently **<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001JSSDGU/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001JSSDGU"><strong>on sale for less than sixty dollars</strong></a> is a fantastic MacBook hard drive option, especially for the price. **</p>

<p><strong>If you want even more space than what the 500GB Western Digital drive offers, there’s also a 1TB version which offers four times the space, enough for more than enough data for your files and this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0034ZD5P0/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0034ZD5P0">notebook hard drive will cost just over $100</a></strong></p>

<p>**<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref_%3Dnb_sb_ss_i_0_22%26field-keywords%3Dsolid%2520state%2520hard%2520drive%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps%26sprefix%3Dsolid%2520state%2520hard%2520drive&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">Solid State Hard Drives</a> are one other option when it comes to more space for your MacBook but be aware that solid state technology is still new and therefore, quite expensive when you compare the prices to more traditional hard drives which can be had for much less. **</p>

<p><strong>To just match or replace the standard 250GB hard drive in your Macbook with a similar hard drive will cost you close to 1000 dollars – as much as the price of the MacBook itself. But if you need speed and portability over space then a SSD or solid state hard drive upgrade still makes sense and smaller size SSD hard drives can be bought for much less, making a MacBook solid state drive upgrade a worthy upgrade option for those in the market for more speed yet sacrifice on total space.</strong></p>

<p>Depending on where or whom you end up buying Apple RAM from, you could either get the best deal on memory or the biggest headache going, and it all comes down to pretty much one thing and that’s customer service. If you’re not buying RAM from Apple and want to save money on RAM you’re probably looking at buying generic memory upgrades which tend to be the lowest priced memory you can buy today, and as long as the technical specs are OK with the technical specifications for memory as outlined in your <a href="http://www.apple.com/support/" title="apple support">Apple’s manual</a>, you’re good to go and can buy the cheap ram.</p>

<p>Where you might get into trouble when buying ram from third party memory stores is when it comes down to what store or memory reseller you buy memory  from, so to help you with a choice on where to buy ram  from vendors you can trust, I created a list of the <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/where-to-buy-computer-memory-upgrades/">best memory stores</a></strong> that I would deal with happily (and have).</p>

<p>As long as you stick to the stores on the list, (<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="apple memory">ram prices are here</a>), you’ll be just fine and  you can get the best price on RAM upgrades for Apple, and pay far less than what Apple would charge you for the same ram upgrades.</p>

<p><strong>A bit more expensive, but still cheaper than Apple when it comes to memory upgrades.</strong></p>

<p>If the thought of <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="buy ram">buying RAM</a> from the stores I  list give you the heebie jeebies, but you still want to save money but don’t mind paying for a better quality product than generic memory can offer, you would be worse  off than to buy either <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW">Kingston RAM</a></strong> or <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">Crucial Memory</a></strong> –  two name brand manufacturers that not  only make the ram , but sell and support the Apple memory upgrades you buy too.</p>

<p><strong>Name brand RAM</strong> is still cheaper than what Apple charges, and yet you will get a high quality memory product that’s priced far, far less than what Apple charges.</p>

<p>Well, it’s no secret that I’m a <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/Apple">fan of Apple computers</a> and have been for some time, but in the last decade PC computers have dropped in price not just with notebooks and desktops,but with netbook computer too, which are the cheapest computers you can buy and easily be found for less than two hundred dollars from jus about every notebook PC manufacturer except Apple, which some will say charge too too much for their products when you can buy computers from other PC brands for less.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I"><img class="alignnone" title="best computer brand" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Screen-shot-2011-04-09-at-4.17.40-PM.png" alt="" width="298" height="232" /><br />
</a><br />
All other PC brands rely on the Windows OS to operate and for some, this could either be an advantage or a curse, depending on your perspective. For my case,  I prefer the Apple OS for one reason only, and that’s the fact that I grew up with the Mac OS  and  when using the windows OS, it confuses me to no end but the same could be same for the Mac OS. One good thing about the Windows OS is that for some of us, there’s a Mac software  version for popular Mac applications that will run on the Windows OS.. Safari and iTunes both come with versions that will run on Windows OS just fine.</p>

<p>If all you’re doing with your PC is web browsing and itunes, you can now do these things on about every smartphone built today so some might argue why bother with the Mac OS when a much cheaper brand of computer will do just fine. I know in my household, I’m a Mac obviously  but my significant other can’t fathom of paying a premium for an Apple computer when a perfectly fine notebook to her runs the windows OS  and saves her money in the process?</p>

<p>Regardless of what side of the Mac/PC fence you  sit on, the <strong>top ten computer brands to buy</strong> today are:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Apple</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Toshiba</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Asus</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Dell</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Samsung</strong></li>

    <h1><a href="/2011/04/how-much-does-it-cost-to-add-ram-to-a-mac/">How Much Does RAM Cost? Adding RAM To iMac Prices</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>One other place where you’ll be paying more for memory is if you want to <strong>upgrade a Mac Pro,</strong> this ram is not the <strong>cheapest RAM for Apple computers</strong> and at the time of writing, <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/Mac_Pro_RAM_Upgrade_Kits_DDR3_1333_with_8GB_RAM-64gb/" title="mac pro 64gb ram prices">64GB for Apple Mac Pro is still a pretty pricey proposition</a>.</p>

<p>That’s how much it costs to add ram to a Mac computer, or Apple Macintosh Computer as they are formally known, and as I have said above adding memory to almost any Mac computer is a pretty good deal. A few exceptions right now will be 16 GB for MacBook Pros, which are still pretty pricey and can cost as much as buying a new MacBook Pro costs in the first place. I’ve yet to have the opportunity to test a MacBook Pro with 16GB and I’m doing just fine on 4GB in a MacBook Pro, and have for a few years now so this just goes to show you that if you’ve got 4 to 8GB of memory installed, you have more than enough RAM installed already. In fact, there’s one website that’s dedicated to <a href="http://www.lowendmac.com" title="low end mac">helping you get more out of your older Mac</a>, negating the need to buy ram or a new Mac at all.Cheap, Cheap, Cheap.</p>

<p>But for most other Macs, especially consumer macs for everyday use – or ‘lifestyle’ computers as they are sometimes known –  RAM upgrades are a really good deal right now and 8GB notebook ram, not just for Apple Notebooks too, is <strong>priced under $100</strong>.</p>

<p>This <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">cheap $100 ram upgrade</a> for both notebooks and desktops that Apple makes maxes out you RAM for both the MacBook Pro and Apple iMac two of the best selling computers Apple makes today, and at time I write this <strong>you can use the same memory in both iMacs and MacBook Pros</strong>.</p>

<p>**Where to get the best deal on Mac RAM today? **</p>

<p>I maintain.  a list of the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/#lowest" title="best apple ram prices">best apple ram prices</a> where you can see the <strong>best prices on Apple RAM **from  an variety  of computer memory stores that offer the best prices on computer memory today for your Apple Mac computer, regardless of whether  you want to upgrade a MacBook, Mac Pro or  iMac – just a few of the **<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26redirect%3Dtrue%26ref_%3Dsr_nr_n_2%26keywords%3Dapple%26bbn%3D541966%26qid%3D1302382612%26rnid%3D541966%26rh%3Dn%253A172282%252Ck%253Aapple%252Cn%253A%2521493964%252Cn%253A541966%252Cn%253A565108&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">best selling Apple computers</a></strong> available on sale today.</p>

<p>The <strong>cost of 4GB RAM memory upgrades</strong> my friends is the sweet spot of ram upgrades currently in 2011 when it comes to <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW">buying RAM for your MacBook Pro</a></strong>.</p>

<p>The 16GB MacBook Pro RAM is still too pricey to really pay attention to unless you have deep deep pockets or really really need the extra performance. I have yet to test 16GB for MacBook Pro, but it only makes sense that MacBook Pros will run faster with double the RAM that Apple states as the maximum, which is 8GB of RAM.</p>

<p>This is why 4GB of RAM for MacBook Pros are the most popular memory modules for MacBook Pros today, and that’s because of the fact that 4GB RAM price for MacBook Pro continue to drop over time, and buying two of them will fill your MacBook Pro and this applies to both the Apple MacBook Pros made in 2011, and  just released a month or so ago, and the later MacBook Pros with the latest refresh being in the spring of 2010.</p>

<p><strong>MacBook Pro RAM Types</strong></p>

<p>The new MacBook Pros announced Feb 24, 2011 take different memory upgrades than what is available or was available for the older 2010 MacBook Pros, so unfortunately, you cannot take the ram from your 2010 MacBook Pro with you and install  it in your new 2011 MacBook Pro – You will have to buy new 4GB ram upgrades for the new MacBook Pros, as they require 4GB DDR3 1333MHz SDRAM so-dimms, while the older MacBook Pros ran on 4GB DDR3 1066Mhz SDRAM so-dimm and the two are not interchangeable.</p>

<p><strong>4GB MacBook RAM Memory Prices</strong></p>

<p>The good news is that if you fill your MBP with 2x 4gb RAM modules, you can do so at a cost of under $100 currently and  in some cases, less as some stores like OWC and OEMPCWORLD will buy back the factory installed memory upgrades that were in your MacBook Pro reducing the price of your MacBook Pro RAM to even less..  There’s no reason to spend more than $50 for a 4GB Apple MacBook Pro Memory Upgrade. Below are the best deals you can find  on Apple 4GB MacBook Pro RAM today for both newer and older MacBoo Pro models.</p>

<p>This one’s easy, as when we’re talking about MacBooks and <strong>not MacBook Pro’s or Airs</strong>, there’s only one MacBook currently on sale that you  can buy and that’s the 2.4GHz Apple MacBook in white with a MSRP of $999. (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002C7489S/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002C7489S">you can do better on the price</a>)</p>

<p><strong>MacBook White 2011 2.4GHz </strong>(<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002C7489S/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002C7489S">see lowest price</a>)</p>

<p>Now if it were my choice and you don’t need to save every penny to <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002C7489S/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002C7489S">buy a MacBook</a></strong>, I would do all I can and <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I">buy  the MacBook Pro</a></strong> instead in the same 13.3 inch format as the MacBook but adds a whole lot more features when you compare the two side by side. On the new MacBook Pro there’s a <strong>faster processor, more RAM capability and the new Thunderbolt technology</strong> that will be the defacto standard when connecting other devices sooner than you’d think.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1651" title="Best MacBook Ever" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Screen-shot-2011-04-03-at-4.25.22-PM.png" alt="Best MacBook To Buy Today" width="298" height="243" /></a></p>

<p><strong>13 inch MacBook Pro: Best of  All MacBooks</strong> (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I">click to see price</a>)</p>

<p>The MacBook is a nice computer, no doubt but with the last refresh being last year in May 2010, the MacBook is starting to show it’s age, especially when compared to the newer big brother. Unless you need to buy a much cheaper computer, I would stick with the MBP when shopping for a MacBook this year as the MacBook Pro’s are the newest and fastest MacBooks.</p>

<p>Let’s compare:</p>

<p><strong>Processor</strong></p>

<p>MacBook: 2.4 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo</p>

<p>MacBook Pro: 2.3GHz dual-core Intel Core i5</p>

<p><strong>RAM</strong></p>

<p>MacBook: 2GB standard, up to 4GB allowed</p>

<p>MacBook Pro: 4GB standard, up to 8GB allowed (16GB, according to <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/OWC">OWC</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Graphics</strong></p>

<p>MacBook:NVIDIA GeForce 320M graphics processor with 256MB of DDR3 SDRAM shared with main memory</p>

<p>MacBook  Pro: Intel HD Graphics 3000</p>

<p><strong>Storage</strong></p>

<p>MacBook: 8x superdrive, 250GB Hard Drive</p>

<p>MacBook Pro: 320GB Hard Drive, 8x SuperDrive</p>

<p>**I/O interfaces **</p>

<p>MacBook: USB 2.0</p>

<p>MacBook Pro: USB 2.0, FireWire 800, ThunderBolt  Port</p>

<p>As you can see, for the added $200 expense the 13 inch 2.3GHz MacBook Pro is the winner here as it adds the same clock speed, (close enough)  but with a much faster Intel processor.</p>

<p><strong>Lightest MacBook</strong></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Screen-shot-2011-04-03-at-4.29.46-PM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1653" title="Lightest MacBook of All" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Screen-shot-2011-04-03-at-4.29.46-PM.png" alt="Best Small Apple Notebook 2011" width="297" height="247" /></a></strong></p>

<p>**MacBook Air. The lightest MacBook **(<a href="a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0047DVRQW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0047DVRQW">click for best price</a>)</p>

<p>And just to make things even more confusing there’s the <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0047DVRQW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0047DVRQW">MacBook Air</a></strong>, which for those needing the smallest and lightest Apple notebooks, this is the choice you’re looking for. The upside with the MacBook Air is the weight of course, weighing just 2.3 lbs, the 11 inch MacBook Air is the lightest notebook you can buy and they start the same as the white MacBook’s do at $999.</p>

<p>The MacBook Air is stripped of a lot of stuff in order to make it the cheapest and lightest MacBook. Gone are the hard drive and optical drive. For the optical drive, you can buy an extra optical drive that plugs into the MacBook Air. If you need an optical drive, I would  suggest you buy a MacBook white  instead as I see no point in trying to slug around a CD drive, as it negates the portability of the MacBook Air in the first place.  Another thing gone on the MacBook Air is the hard drive, which instead is replaced with  a 64GB or 128GB hard drive depending on the configuration of MacBook Air you buy. There’s also a 13 inch MacBook Air, but I think for any serious work, the 1.4GHz Intel Core 2 processor is back in time, even if the SSD hard drive speeds  up read and writing of data.</p>

<p>So. If you really, really need the lightest Apple notebook you can buy, then <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0047DVRQW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0047DVRQW">grab the MacBook Air</a></strong>, but the best selling and best deal when it comes to MacBooks in 2011 is currently the <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I">Apple MacBook Pro 13 inch</a></strong> and with some shopping around for the best price can be had closer to the $999 list price of the white MacBook than you would believe.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I">Buy the 13inch MacBook Pro </a></strong>as currently, it’s the <strong>best MacBook of  the bunch</strong>.</p>
