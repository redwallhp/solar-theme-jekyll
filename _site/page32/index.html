<p>Dubbed as the new convertible, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004XZMCAY/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B004XZMCAY">Dell Inspiron Convertible Tablet PC</a> converts from being both an easy to use touch based  tablet to a more conventional notebook PC all with a twist of the LCD display. Rotate the display  depending on your computing needs. Never have to ask yourself which notebook you should buy or which tablet to buy because this stylish device satisfies both your notebook PC and tablet needs in an all in one design eliminating the need to buy or worse, carry two devices for your portable computing needs.</p>

<p>The memory upgrade options are rather limited for this unique and portable netbook but you can, and should max out the Dell Inspiron Duo to the maximum memory of 2GB by uprading the one memory upgrade slot with a 2GB DDR3 1333Mhz sodimm <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">ram upgrade for the Dell Inspiron Duo</a></p>

<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: 15px; font-weight: bold;">Dell Inspiron R Laptops</span></p>

<p>Unlike the Duo netbook or tablet above, the Dell Inspiron R laptops are the perfect solution for both home and office computing thanks to unique features such as switch lids to customize the appearance of your Dell Inspiron notebook. (Personally, I think switch lids or any other sticker for you notebook is a complete waste of money, but to each their own)</p>

<p>Like the smaller Dell 14R,  the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004XZMCAY/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B004XZMCAY">15R from Dell</a> offers more screen real estate, a second generation Intel i3 processor running at 2.2 GHz, a 640Gb internal hard drive and 6GB of RAM as standard equipment all for a sale price of just over $500, which isn’t too bad a deal on a Dell. Understandably the Dell Inspiron  15R is one of the best selling notebook computers from this well known name brand  notebook computer manufacturer. While 6GB of RAM installed from the factory is a respectable amount, the Dell Inspiron 15R  will perform even better with a Dell Inspiron Upgrade and  <a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT2KIT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1339">8GB of RAM for the Dell 15R</a> is so cheap it makes sense to upgrade the RAM on your Dell 15R. For further savings you can sell the old ram in your Dell and apply the proceeds to the newer and bigger Dell 15R Memory Upgrade Kit.</p>

With the big screen, perfect for both work or play and fast Intel core i3 processors the Dell 17R takes the high performance specifications of the  15R and adds more screen real estate –  a perfect screen size for gaming or spreadsheet or graphics work. 6GB DDR3 memory comes standard with this big screen notebook from Dell, but like  the 15R and 14R you can and should max out the RAM on your Dell Inspiron 17R with an <a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT2KIT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1339">8GB DDR3 1333Mhz notebook memory upgrade</a>.

At $399*, it’s hard to compare or even get a better deal on a notebook in 2011 – the Dell Inspiron is that good. Perfect for light home use or just ever day computing such as blogging or facebook, the Inspiron 15, (not to be confused with the faster 15R) offers a 15 inch LCD display, roomy keyboard and the option to buy it in one of two colors the plain 15 inch notebook is one of the better notebook deals available today. With a fast 2.53Ghz intel Core i3 processor an 3GB of system memory as standard this cheap notebook offers a significant value and  by adding  more ram to the Dell Inspiron 15 you can  increase the  speed of  this cheap dell notebook even more as this notebook by Dell will accept a maximum of <a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT2KIT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1339">8GB of DDR3 1333Mhz RAM</a> and  if there  is a Dell notebook that’s in need of a ram upgrade, the Dell  Inspiron 15 is it. 3GB of RAM is not enough RAM in 2011.</p>

These larger memory modules were not available to purchase when the iMac was released in May 2011, so the <strong>official maximum ram of 16GB is what is supported by Apple</strong> and if you want to have your warranty intact, you may want to consider this.</p>

<p>That said, <strong>32GB iMac RAM</strong> just requires you to <a href="http://www.kqzyfj.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT102464BF1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT102464BF1339">buy 4x8GB sodimms</a>.

<p>The Mac Mini is available in two configurations:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004YLCLM6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B004YLCLM6">Apple Mac Mini 2.3 GHz Intel Core i5 processor</a> $599.99 (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004YLCLM6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B004YLCLM6"> click for sale price </a>)</p>

<p>Regardless of what Mac Mini you choose. (I would go with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004YLCLM6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B004YLCLM6">cheaper $599 Mac Mini</a> and  use the $200 savings towards buying new peripherals) these new 2911 Apple  Mac Mini’s are real easy to upgrade the RAM on and with the exception of the Mac Pro might be the easiest Mac to add memory upgrades to. If you can unscrew the lid on a jar of peanut butter you can upgrade mac mini RAM with ease.</p>

<p>And you should <strong><a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT2KIT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1339">upgrade the RAM on the Mac Mini to the maximum allowed of 8GB</a></strong>.  The cheap Mac Mini comes out of the box with just 2GB of RAM installed so it’s a perfect candidate for a memory <strong><a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT2KIT51264BC1067%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1067">upgrade all the way to 8GB</a></strong> as is the 4GB 2.5GHz  Mac Mini which does benefit from more RAM installed at the factory, but you will pay for it. In addition to the faster processor with the Apple Mac Mini, you’re also paying considerably more for the 4GB of RAM over where you could buy  it from a brand name ram vendor such as <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">Crucial </a>or Corsair or Kingston, which offer more value when it comes to Apple RAM Upgrades. The street price of  a 2GB RAM upgrade is only about $10 at time of writing.</p>

<p>And despite what the <a href="http://www.apple.com/macmini/specs.html">Apple Store may tell you</a> you <strong>don’t need to buy RAM from Apple for your Mac Mini</strong>.  As long as you buy ram from a reputable memory store like <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">Crucial</a>, you will have no problem when it comes to add RAM to your brand new 2011 Apple Mac Mini.</p>

<p><strong>Can I install 16GB of RAM into the 2011 Apple Mac Mini?</strong></p>

<p>Like the case  for <strong>32GB for the Apple iMac</strong>,  the answer is twofold: yes, but no.</p>

<p>Yes, you can upgrade the Apple Mac Mini to 16GB  because  the Apple Mac Mini accepts two <a href="http://www.kqzyfj.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT102464BF1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT102464BF1339">8GB 1333Mhz SDRAM sodimms</a>, and back in July 8GB sodimms for Apple Mac Mini were rare and thus, really pricey – costing more than the Mac Mini  itself. Things have changed a bit since and <strong>8GB ram modules for Mac Mini are starting to drop in price</strong> some, but you will still pay a pretty penny to get 16GB of RAM for Mac Mini this year.</p>

<p>The second part of the answer  is that <strong>Apple only supports 8GB  of RAM in these small desktop computers</strong>. If you install 8GB x 2 to get to 16GB you should have no problem with that much Mac Mini ram installed, but in the rare case things go amuck when you install the 16GB of RAM you’re on your own. It’s very doubtful that the Apple limited warranty would cover installing more memory than what was supported. It’s always been my policy to recommend you stick to the maximum RAM as per Apple. 8GB of memory upgrades for Mac Mini should be more than enough RAM if you’re using the Mac Mini for home office, home or school tasks.</p>

<p>If you do need a Mac with 16GB you should buy an iMac or Mac Pro, which offers both faster processors as well as added memory upgrade capacity.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ZR4M6I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=B003ZR4M6I"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1478" title="Buy Mac Pro" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Screen-shot-2011-03-26-at-2.03.40-PM2.png" alt="Best Macintosh Pro" width="159" height="259" /></a></p>

<p>The Apple Mac Pro from Apple is getting long in the tooth and we have yet to see a 2011 Apple Mac Pro release from Apple this year  for their professional based desktop computer and the newest  Apple Mac Pro you can buy has a release date of August 10, 2010, over a year ago.</p>

<p>But regardless of age of the current Mac Pro lineup, these are still considered new computers and are available as such in 2011.</p>

<p>Available as either a 8 Core configuration featuring</p>

<ul>
  <li>Two 2.4GHz Quad-Core Intel Xeon E5620 “Westmere” processors</li>
</ul>

<p>or one Quad core processor Mac Pro  featuring</p>

<ul>
  <li>One 2.8GHz Quad-Core Intel Xeon W3530 “Nehalem” processor as the standard processor configuration</li>
</ul>

<div>
  The memory you need for the Apple Mac Pro gets a little tricky as even though they are considered new Apple Mac Pro models the processor  speed and type determines  what memory upgrade you need to buy:
</div>

<div>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Dual-processor systems</strong> <ul>
        <li>
          2.4GHz system: 1066MHz DDR3 ECC SDRAM
        </li>
        <li>
          2.66GHz and 2.93GHz systems: 1333MHz DDR3 ECC SDRAM
        </li>
        <li>
          Eight memory slots (four per processor) supporting up to 64GB of main memory using 1GB, 2GB, 4GB, or 8GB DIMMs
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      <strong>Single Processor systems</strong> <ul>
        <li>
          2.8GHz and 3.2GHz systems: 1066MHz DDR3 ECC SDRAM
        </li>
        <li>
          3.33GHz system: 1333MHz DDR3 ECC SDRAM
        </li>
        <li>
          Four memory slots supporting up to 32GB of main memory using 1GB, 2GB, 4GB, or 8GB DIMM
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <div>
    As you can see from the chart above, there&#8217;s many choices when it comes to Apple Mac Pro memory so be sure to buy the right speed of memory for Mac  Pro whether you need to buy Mac Pro 1333GHz or Mac Pro 1066GHz RAM, as it can be confusing  and you want to be certain you match  the right ram for the right Mac Pro.
  </div>
  
  <div>
    My guess, and the <a href="http://www.macrumors.com">Mac Pro Rumors</a> tend  to confirm this, is that there&#8217;s a Mac Pro refresh in the works  that will not only allow for faster processors but will sychronize the ram requirements so that all new 2011 Apple Mac Pro models use the  same memory type, just like all the  other Apple computer models do.
  </div>
</div>

<h3 id="can-the-apple-mac-pro-accept-64gb-of-ram">Can the Apple Mac Pro Accept 64GB of RAM?</h3>

<p>Like the Apple iMac and Mac Mini above, the technical answer is no if you have the single processor. The single  processor Mac Pros max out at  32GB of RAM. The dual processsor Mac Pro systems can in fact accept 64GB of RAM if you have the budget for it. 64GB of RAM for Mac Pro is not cheap and unless you really need the fastest desktop possible to get your work done faster, you may be able to get away with 32GB of Mac Pro Memory.</p>

<p>The MacBook Pro is my favorite Apple Computer when it comes to Apple portables and when you consider what it costs to buy a MacBook Pro in the first place, a MacBook Pro RAM upgrade is a no brainer if you ask me.  Like the <a href="http://www.nike.com">Nike </a>ad says ‘just do it’.</p>

<p>editor’s note: I would buy the cheapest MacBook Pro which in this case is the 13 inch MBP and use the money you saved for the next upgrade MacBook Pro, which might be as early as late 2011 and then use the savings from not buying the more expensive MacBook Pro’s to put towards the  2012 MacBook Pros when they are released in just a few short months. This is just one strategy to saving money on not only RAM, but also the computer the memory is being installed into.</p>

<p>But regardless of what Apple MacBook Pro you already own or are  considering buying upgrade the RAM to the maximum using a 8GB DDR3 SDRAM sodimm memory upgrade kit.  8GB MacBook Pro memory is so cheap  that it makes absolutely no sense to me why you run the stock MacBook Pro ram configuration when for under $50 you can max out  the RAM on your MacBook Pro</p>

<p><strong>Can I Upgrade MacBook Pro Memory to 16GB?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, you can. You need  to buy 8GB 1333Mhz sodimms  on sale and install them in the two memory upgrade banks or sockets available for an upgrade by removing the stock Apple RAM with more advanced and high quality 8GB laptop memory. The problem with adding 16GB MacBook Pro memory is that it’s still pretty pricey and could cost as much as the MacBook Pro you’re installing the 16GB upgrade into.</p>

<p>You’re better off with 8GB of MacBook Pro Memory. 8GB is the deal when it comes to Apple MacBook Pro Memory Upgrades. 16GB is still too expensive in 2011 to be a worthwhile upgrade.  Besides, installing 16GB into a MBP is not something that Apple recommends and neither can I. You may void your warranty by installing more memory than what is the maximum at time of release. I’d stick to 8GB and enjoy the Apple MacBook Pro with a full warranty intact.</p>

<p>As you can see from the Apple MacBook Air lineup  for 2011,  the cheapest MacBook Air comes pretty much crippled with lack of RAM and all could use at least 8GB MacBook Air Memory to really make these small and fast notebooks from Apple shine, but Apple decided to make the maximum ram  at 4GB. Considering the Mac OS Lion requires 1GB of RAM, that doesn’t leave you with a lot of memory to play around with. That said, these are consumer based notebooks not professional notebooks and with the MacBook Air you get true plug and play as there are no upgrades  you can, or need to perform when you buy a MacBook Air as opposed to the Apple MacBook Pro that requires a ram upgrade to really see what  the MBP can do.</p>

<p>It’s easier to show you <a href="http://www.apple.com">where not to buy memory</a> upgrades for Apple computers than to provide you with a list of all the great stores you can <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/where-to-buy-computer-memory-upgrades/">buy memory upgrades</a> from, but you can get a great deal on RAM  for Apple without much trouble at all and if you’re in  the market for name brand memory such as <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">Crucial Technology RAM</a> , or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;ref_=nb_sb_ss_i_0_15&amp;field-keywords=kingston%20memory%20ddr3&amp;url=search-alias%3Delectronics&amp;sprefix=kingston%20memory&amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">Kingston </a>or Corsair, now is te best time in the 15 years I have been checking ram prices for Apple computers online. <strong>8GB of RAM for the iMacs, MacBook Pro or the Mac Mini in 2011 has dropped in price to half what it was just a few months ago</strong>, so if you’ve been sitting on the fence waiting to buy ram, don’t wait much longer as  I can’t forecast ram prices getting  much lower than they already have been.</p>

<p>If you have already have a new 2011 Mac but have been watching for ram prices to drop, again you really should upgrade the ram on your new Mac at your earliest convenience. The Apple computers are far from the cheapest computer you can  buy comparable PC’s for much less but the benefit of Apple over other brands of computers is that they tend to hold their resale value and adding RAM is just one more way to not only increase your day to day productivity but also increase the value of your Mac when it’s  time for an Apple Computer upgrade for your next new Apple computer.</p>

** In our increasingly mobile, fast paced society–the need for processing speed on laptop and notebook computers has created a second issue of importance for end users: longer battery life. With business and professional users of the Apple product line travelling more and working increasingly from venues outside the office cubicle the need for longer battery life was increasingly important.</p>

<p>Apple introduced the Apple MacBook Pro 2.8GHz Intel Core 2 Duo 15” in the summer of 2009 to address this issue with its “innovative built-in battery for up to 40 percent longer battery life.”</p>

<p>In the past, a longer lived battery meant adding more bulk to the computer, a major selling point of the Apple MacBook Pro2.8GHz 15” was the fact that this model and those subsequent extended useable wireless battery power to seven hours on a single charge without adding to the size, weight or price of the unit. Distinguished by “Adaptive Charging”, the new battery iteration promised to deliver up to 1000 recharges before reaching 80 percent of original capacity. This innovation was at the time nearly three times the lifespan of conventional computer batteries. Not only was longer battery life attractive in terms of end use, the increasingly “Green” conscious consumer could well appreciate that longer battery life means fewer depleted batteries and less waste. Further appeal to the environmentally minded, this model along with the entire MacBook Pro line up achieved EPEAT* Gold status and meets Energy Star 5.0 requirements a new standard for environmentally friendly notebook design.</p>

<p>The Apple MacBook Pro2.8GHz 15” included the equally green LED backlit display, renowned for its greater color intensity with a 1440 x 900 standard resolution; the processor a speedy 2.8 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo with 6MB shared L2 cache. This model also featured the glass Multi-Touch™ trackpad, an illuminated keyboard, an SD card or ExpressCard slot, a FireWire® 800 port and state of the art NVIDIA graphics married with a 2.8 GHz Core 2 Duo processor, a 500 GB hard drive.</p>

<p>The Apple MacBook Pro2.8GHz 15” offered the following features:</p>

<p>Lightweight, environmentally friendly aluminum unibody case;</p>

<p>1066 MHz front-side bus;</p>

<p>500GB serial ATA hard drive running at 5400 rpm, with Sudden Motion Sensor;</p>

<p>The Apple Mac Mini is my new favorite Mac in the Apple lineup and for one reason: It’s cheap.</p>

<p>I have already compared the iMac and Mac Mini and when you do the math, it’s not hard to save up  to $300 when you buy a Mac Mini and external mouse, monitor, and keyboard as opposed to pulling the trigger on an iMac.</p>

<p>What could you do with the extra money you save? Buy a SSD drive, as they are getting big enough and cheap enough to use as your main hard drive. (with limitations). The biggest limitation being your budget, and remembering that you’re looking to upgrade a $600 desktop here. You have to stop and ask yourself is it really worth it to pour another $500 or so into it. If you add 16GB of RAM in addition to the Mac Mini, you may just be better off buying a Mac Pro.</p>

<p>Regardless, the Mac Mini SSD Drive options are many and here’s a few options to consider: These will also work just fine in your MacBook Pro and iMacs too.</p>

<h3 id="crucial-128-gb-m4-25-inch-solid-state-drive-sata-6gbs-ct128m4ssd2img-classalignleft-size-full-wp-image-3076-titlebest-crucial-ssd-drive-for-mac-mini-srchttpwwwramseekercomwp-contentuploads201110screen-shot-2011-10-07-at-72719-ampng-altcheap-mac-mini-ssd-drive-width312-height242-1"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004W2JKZI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B004W2JKZI">Crucial 128 GB m4 2.5-Inch Solid State Drive SATA 6Gb/s CT128M4SSD2<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3076" title="Best Crucial SSD Drive for Mac Mini" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Screen-Shot-2011-10-07-at-7.27.19-AM.png" alt="Cheap Mac Mini SSD Drive" width="312" height="242" /></a></h3>

<p>With a street price of under $200, the latest in solid state drive technology from Crucial comes in the form of the Crucial 128MB M4 SSD drive. At just 128MB, you may be limited in your storage space when compared to bigger conventional hard drives but you win when it comes to boot time and drive access speed, allowing you to work faster</p>

<p>The crucial m4 128MB solid state drive is the best selling SSD drive today, and is compatible with more than just the Apple Mac Mini, but works with all others in the Apple lineup and any other Windows OS model that can accept a 2.5 inch SATA form factor.</p>

A hundred dollar SSD upgrade is the best bargain for a Mac Mini SSD option as it allows fast access to common files and the Mac OS for super fast startup times, yet doesn’t cost too much compared to the Mac Mini. Upgrade the Mac Min RAM to 8Gb at the same time, and for $150 or less, you have a much faster Mac Mini when you bought the Mac Mini from Apple.</p>
