<p>I forgot about this version of linux, and have been using <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com">ubuntu</a> as my daily driver currently, but I might like to give this OS a shot too. It looks to have a very apple OS X feel to it and for new users or those coming from Mac OS it might be a moref familiar environment.</p>

		<div class="post-content"><p>Dan Knight at Low End Mac makes <a href="http://lowendmac.com/2016/iphone-history-small-steps-and-big-leaps">some interesting thoughts on speed</a> increases on iPhones as they have progressed:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I think we’ve come to the end of the big forward leaps in processing power. We may see 3- and 4-core processors and higher clock speeds, but even then don’t expect to see a tripling – or even doubling – of performance from one iPhone generation to the next.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think he’s right. I have jumped from an iPhone 4s to 5 and an iPad Mini as the 3 apple iOS devices and to be honest - they all work great and the speed doesn’t seem all that different to me. The reviews state the iPhone SE to be super fast, but when I quickly demoed one the other day at Best Buy, I came away unimpressed.</p>

<p>There used to be a day when speed mattered more. Now, I think it’s battery life that does.</p>
