>  It’s easy to see, in retrospect, the huge amount of Apple hardware that was available twenty years ago compared to the post-Jobs order in the early 2000s

It sure was hard to choose a Mac in 1996 - You forget how many models Apple had back then. This is a great list, and look back to a time when all was beige.

I bought one of these Micro SD cards to toss in my phone and they work great. I have more music downloaded than I ever really need. Spring for the brand name - I've bought cheaper ones on eBay and they are too slow. This is well worth the $20 or so it cost me.

> OS X is an Apple interface wrapped around a Unix core, whereas Ubuntu is a Unix interface wrapped around a Unix core. This makes switching from OS X much easier than switching from Windows, but still quite challenging. For example, the OS X terminal is almost as powerful as the Linux terminal, but you'll need to use far more of that power in Linux.

This paragraph nails it. It takes some time, but once you get the hang of the terminal in Ubuntu this makes the Ubuntu eperience well worth the switch. I've done it. </div>

		<div class="post-content">I have recently become more interested in Ubuntu than Mac OS in recent months, mostly in part becasue my needs are so light that I don't need to cough up so much money to buy an Apple computer when a cheaper alternative is available. 

I am writing this on a used Thinkpad for under $100 (about the same price as 16GB of RAM for the Mac) that I tossed Ubuntu on and I get a working computer for writing or blogging and even some light image editing. 

But, if you wanted to make a hackintosh out of an older thinkpad - it seems you can:

> Follow these steps to perform a clean installation of OS X 10.11 El Capitan on your ThinkPad x220 or x220 Tablet.
> – If you already have OS X 10.10 Yosemite on your x220 we recommend doing a clean installation of El Capitan, not an update from the existing installation.
> – See the guide here to install OS X 10.10 Yosemite on the ThinkPad x220

		<div class="post-content">When I can't use a text editor for writing stuff, I often turn to Marxico. It's not free for the evernote syncing part - I think it costs about $17.00 annually. I don't really use the evernote stuff much but the markdown writing and preview experience is very nice. 

There's apps available, but they're pretty much the same as firing up the browser of choice and visiting:

		<div class="post-content">In my quest for the perfect writing workflow, I have found this to be a pretty nice online markdown edtior. 

I really like that it allows you to connect to your github account and make changes directly from the app. 

And, because it's online and browswer based - you can use this to write from anywhere. 

My only complaint, is that I get an error when connecting and retrieving files from Google Drive, so as much as I like this - I will still stick to using Calmly Writer as my current writing tool of choice. 

Regardless, it's a nice little web app.

I forgot about this version of linux, and have been using [ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com) as my daily driver currently, but I might like to give this OS a shot too. It looks to have a very apple OS X feel to it and for new users or those coming from Mac OS it might be a moref familiar environment.
