<p><strong>Not Yet.  You can’t buy 32GB MacBook Pro Memory Upgrades</strong></p>

<p>The most memory you can install is 16GB into a current Apple MacBook Pro . The Apple MacBook Pro’s available on sale in 2013 max out at 16GB of RAMThis applies to all Apple MacBook Pros currently available online for sale:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Apple MacBook Pro 13-inch: 2.5GHz</li>
  <li>Apple MacBook Pro 13-inch: 2.9GHz</li>
  <li>Apple MacBook Pro 13-inch: 2.5GHz with Retina display</li>
  <li>Apple MacBook Pro 13-inch: 2.6GHz with Retina display</li>
  <li>Apple MacBook Pro 15-inch: 2.3GHz</li>
  <li>Apple Macbook Pro 15-inch: 2.4GHz with Retina display</li>
  <li>Apple MacBook Pro 15-inch: 2.7GHz with Retina display</li>
</ul>

<p>I wonder: will the maximum RAM upgrades you can install in any MacBook Pro will stop at 16GB. I guess it’s time to come to ask the question: <strong>How much ram do you need? </strong></p>

<p>The Apple MacBook Air models don’t even come with upgradable ram upgrades. If you buy a MacBook Air and want the most ram you can install in it  you better be ready to buy an 8GB MacBook Air because if you don’t you’re stuck with the 4GB option which leaves you little ram left over once you get the MacOS up and running. That said, small screens and 4GB of RAM seem to be a popular choice with Apple customers, especially if the MacBook Air is the secondary or light use computer. (another option would be to buy a chromebook)</p>

<p><strong>Apple MacBook Pro Memory Price Increases</strong></p>

<p>Also, RAM for Apple MacBook Pros have close to doubled in recent months. This is one of the very few memory price increases I have seen in the 15 years I have been monitoring ram prices for Apple computers. Usually, ram prices for Apple computer have always dropped in price over time.This is a first.</p>

<p>At current ram prices, the cheapest 16GB RAM for MacBook Pro you can buy  is about $125.00.  This means if you were to buy 32GB MacBook Pro RAM it’s quite possible that the price would be double that if not more with 32GB MacBook Pro memory costing as much as $250.00 to $300 or even more. And god forbid if you buy the memory from the Apple Store, as this option will <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/do-i-have-to-buy-memory-ram-from-apple/" title="Do I Have To Buy Memory RAM From Apple?">cost you much much more</a>.</p>

<p>A MacBook Pro with 32GB would be a pricey notebook computer. Assuming the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0074703CM/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0074703CM&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=ramseeker-20">best price you can get on a 13 inch MacBook Pro is about $1100.00 </a>, and adding 32GB MacBook Pro RAM costing you say $300, the cheapest MacBook Pro maxed out with 32Gb of RAM could cost you close to $1500.00, and if you upgrade to the Apple MacBook Pro 15-inch: 2.7GHz with Retina display you’d be north of 3 grand with 32GB of RAM installed.</p>

<p>This all assumes that ram prices for MacBook Pros stay stable too. If you start adding RAM later it might even cost you more. Now if you’ve got deep pockets or need the fastest MacBook Pro money can buy, then the price for 32GB of RAM for MacBook Pro is not much at all, especially if you use your MacBook Pro for photo or video editing you need the fastest MacBook Pro you can buy and the price of RAM or the MacBook Pro might not matter at all because you’re making money with your MacBook Pro.</p>

<p><strong>Sell Your Factory Installed MacBook Pro RAM</strong></p>

<p>One thing that might help offset the cost of 32GB would be to<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/where-can-i-sell-old-ram/" title="Where Can I Sell Old RAM?"> sell your old ram</a> that came with the MacBook Pro in the first place. Let’s say you’ve got 16GB of RAM from your MacBook Pro installed from the Apple directly. You could remove the ram and trade it for 32GB MBP ram. You won’t get a whole lot for the old ram but there’s many memory vendors that will allow you to trade in your old ram for larger memory upgrade modules effectively lowering the price you have to pay for the bigger ram for your MacBook Pro.</p>

<p><strong>You’re Going To Have To Wait for 32GB MacBook Pro RAM</strong></p>

<p>I don’t know any memory store that sells 32GB for MacBook Pro just yet. There’s MacBook Pro rumors that a 2013 refresh of the MacBook Pro’s could happen at WWDC later this summer but like all Apple rumors, that’s all it is at this time – a rumor.</p>

<p>Of course,<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/apple-macintosh-memory-16gb-macbook-pro-ram/" title="MacBook Pro 16GB RAM Upgrades"> just like I did with 16GB of RAM</a> I’ll let you know when 32GB of RAM for MacBook Pros does come available and of course I will find the lowest price you can pay for 32GB MacBook Pro Memory</p>
