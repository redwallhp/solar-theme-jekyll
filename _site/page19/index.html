<p>In 2015, there are many reasons to upgrade the ram in a laptop, but the most important is speed. Simply put, more ram makes your notebook or laptop run faster than it would without.</p>

<h2 id="what-to-look-for-in-laptop-ram">What to look for in laptop ram</h2>

<p>The first thing to look for when looking to add more memory to your notebook is whether you can upgrade or not. Some of the newer notebooks like the 2015 <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;field-keywords=macbook&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;rh=i:aps,k:macbook&amp;tag=replaceable-20&amp;url=search-alias=aps&amp;linkId=A5KSJHMZAOOYIZGS">MacBook</a> or the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;ajr=0&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;field-keywords=dell%20xps&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;rh=i:aps,k:dell%20xps&amp;tag=replaceable-20&amp;url=search-alias=aps&amp;linkId=SB3D6T6PR7BFI22T">Dell XPS 13</a> ship with the RAM soldered on the motherboard meaning you’re out of luck when it comes to upgrading so be sure to buy the most ram you can afford at the time of purchase.</p>

<p>But if you can upgrade the ram on your notebook computer it’s best to do so because ram is <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/2015/03/how-much-does-ram-cost/">pretty cheap these days</a> and in most instances you can upgrade the ram to twice what was installed in the computer.</p>

<h2 id="apple-laptop-ram">Apple Laptop RAM</h2>

<p>One of the most <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com">popular ram prices</a> I monitor memory prices for are Apple Computers. Some newer models <strong>all have their ram soldered to the motherboard</strong> so it you’re looking to upgrade ram on an Apple notebook prior to 2012 you’re pretty much out of luck.</p>

<h2 id="dell-laptop-ram">Dell Laptop RAM</h2>

<p>I have mentioned earlier that the Dell XPS for 2015 cannot be upgraded but some older XPS models can be so like the Apple models you’re best to check out how much ram your notebook takes. The Dell consumer models like the Dell Inspiron models can take a ram upgrade and you can usually at least double the ram from 4GB standard to 8GB for well under $100.00</p>

<p>Dell Alienware models usually ship with all the ram they need as they are professional gaming computers and need all the performance and speed they can get and so have the ram installed at time of manufacturer.</p>

<p>Dell Latitude memory upgrades are available for current models as these are business models that are priced to be competitive in the market and one way of meeting a certain price point is to add the minimum amount of RAM and let the business or consumer’s IT department add more memory later if needed</p>

<h2 id="hp-laptop-ram">HP Laptop RAM</h2>

<p>HP computers come in a wide array of models from entry level ultrabooks to high end gaming computers and they can all use a memory upgrade. Some might be soldered to the motherboard but a lot of ram upgrades are still available with common upgrade prices usually around the $100 mark for HP Laptop memory – maybe a bit more for 16GB HP notebook ram kits.</p>

<h2 id="ram-for-notebooks-is-cheap-in-2015">RAM for Notebooks is Cheap in 2015</h2>

<p>The prices for ram for notebook computers used to be much higher than they are now and cost a fraction of the price, but if you are looking to buy a ram upgrade for your notebook the cost will be about $75.00 for 8GB of RAM and $125.00 for 16GB of RAM for upgrading your laptop to the most ram it can handle.</p>

  </p>
</div>

<p>With Apple’s release of the 2015 MacBook Pro refreshes earlier this month there’s a few things you might want to know about the 2015 MacBook Pro models vs the 2014 versions:</p>

<h2 id="not-all-macbook-pros-are-the-same">Not All MacBook Pros Are The Same</h2>

<p>Only Some of the [MacBook Pro models saw an upgrade][1]. The 15 inch models did not get an upgrade at all and are still stuck with 2014 specifications. In fact, only 3 models got an upgrade for 2015:</p>

<p>13 inch 2.7Ghz with Retina Display (128GB and 256GB) and the 13 inch 2.9Ghz with retina display.</p>

<p>All others are still stuck on last year’s specifications with the 13 inch 2.5Ghz non retina display model being the only 13 inch MacBook Pro without an upgrade. The 15 inch display also did not see an upgrade at all either.</p>

<p>If you want to buy a new MacBook Pro for 2015 so far it will be one of the 3 that saw the updates.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="macbook-pros-are-still-expensive">MacBook Pros are Still Expensive</h2>

<p>Maybe the ‘pro’ in the name should have been the giveaway but these are still priced at over a thousand dollars for even the cheapest MacBook Pro you can buy at $1099.00 and really can’t compare with the other models with more RAM, faster processors, <strong>much faster storage</strong> [1][2]{#fnref-storage.footnote} and a much nicer screen</p>

<p>So really, the bargain of the bunch when it comes to the new MacBook Pro models are the 13 inch 2.7Ghz Retina display models. With 8GB of RAM standard on the $1299.00 model, the only difference between the 2.7Ghz models are the size of the storage. If you want more storage the upgrade from 128GB to 256GB is $200.00.</p>

<p>The most expensive 13 inch MacBook Pro for 2015 is the 2.9Ghz with a 7% increase in speed over the 2.7Ghz models you might want to ask yourself if it’s really worth it to buy the most expensive model that starts at $1799.00 for the high end 13 incher.</p>

<p>The 15 inch models even get stupider and cost $1999.00 and $2499.00. The <strong>cheap</strong> 15 inch model is 2.2GHz with 16GB of RAM and 256GB storage and the most expensive MacBook Pro you can buy is 2.5Ghz and 16GB of RAM with 512GB SSD storage.</p>

<p>Now you do get a bigger screen with the 15 inch vs 13 inch models so you might want to think about how much screen real estate you really need. The difference in size and weight is another thing to consider and not just the cost.</p>

<h2 id="dont-buy-the-cheapest-macbook-pro">Don’t Buy The Cheapest Macbook Pro</h2>

<p>It’s old technology and you will hate it very soon. I can’t think of using anything but solid state storage in any notebook anymore and unless you really can’t afford anything else I can’t recommend this model. If you’re on a budget the cheapest Mac Portable you can buy is the [MacBook Air][3], and these saw an upgrade too this year and are still well under $1000 too.</p>

<h2 id="dont-buy-the-most-expensive-macbook-pro">Don’t Buy The Most Expensive MacBook Pro</h2>

<p>Unless you have money to burn, the higher end MacBook Pros are really not recommended at this time due to their older design so that leaves you with asking what 13 inch MacBook Pro to get?</p>

<p>I always look to get the middle model as I feel it has the best value. Of the three 13 inch models that were released in March 2015, the only difference between the two cheaper models are storage space and the fact the most expensive model costs a lot more with just a small increase in speed and some more storage makes me wonder if I need all that speed and storage.</p>

<p>I guess it all comes down to what you plan to do with your MacBook? If you’re blogging and checking email then the 2.7Ghz Retina display at $1299.00 would be my pick but if you have to make money with your MacBook Pro and time is money then maybe it’s worth it to buy the <strong>most expensive model</strong> and know that you have the fastest Apple notebook you can buy today</p>

<p>But if it were my money, I would pick the $1299.00 model as 128GB of storage is just fine for me when it comes to storage space.</p>

<h2 id="the-new-models-have-force-trackpads">The New Models Have Force Trackpads</h2>

<p>Do you need a force trackpad? Probably not – at least right now that there’s minimal support for it and until a week or so this didn’t even exist, but you might as well get the one model of the MacBook Pro that has <strong>all the features</strong> and the 13 inch models feature this new technological advance in trackpads so you may as well buy a future proof trackpad instead of something with older technology</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>Do your homework when shopping for a new MacBook Pro and I am sure you will find a model that suits your needs and budget and will last you a very long time compared to other Windows or Linux notebooks.</p>

    <a href="http://www.lowend.mac.com">Low End Mac </a> is a great site for getting more out of your Mac
  </p>
</div>

<p><a href="http://www.lowendmac.com">Low  End  Mac  </a>was one of the very first sites I ever came across way back when,  and has been a favorite ever since and you will find that this is a very useful resource for the Apple community.</p>

<p>It’s especially fun to check out their <strong>Mac of the Day </strong>feature and see how the older Apple computers have aged.  There are other sites that highlight older computers, but like the name suggests Low End Mac does this very well and has information you can’t get or find any more for the older Apple computers.</p>

<p>They offer <a href="http://lowendmac.com/profiles.htm">technical specs</a> to pretty much every mac you can think of  which can be handy when you need to know how much ram  your older mac can  take for an example. <img src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> .  Also be sure to check out the articles for some great stuff on how to get the most of your older Mac.</p>

<p>I think that even more so now than in the past  – despite all the hoopla about the latest and greatest computers like the new MacBook, etc – you can still get very good mileage out of some older computers. Personally, I have posted blog posts for this site from a ten year old PowerBook G4 so  I’m a fan of Low End  Mac, (as well as being cheap) <img src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p>There are a lot of resources on the web about new macs and all the rumors and headlines, but Low End Mac is one  of the  few sites to help you be happy with what you’ve got.</p>

<p>Here’s  a few of my favorite articles recently:</p>

<p><a href="http://lowendmac.com/2015/the-new-macbook-and-the-imac-effect/">The  New MacBook and the iMac Effect</a></p>

<p><a href="http://lowendmac.com/2015/radius-displays-video-cards-and-clones/">Radius Displays, Video Cards, and Clones</a></p>

<p>Prices may change over time, but you should expect to pay that much for ram you buy and replace your old ram that came pre-installed when you bought your computer</p>

<!--more-->

<div id="asa-6bb7eaf10f48a75bbd2c72446f935a4b" class="asa_async_container asa_async_container_default">
</div>

<p>The good news is you <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/2011/01/where-can-i-sell-old-ram/">can sell your old ram</a>t to recover some of the price of the new ram by trading in your old ram.</p>

<p>You won’t get a whole lot for your old ram trade in, but you will get some money back when you send in your old ram for trade in. According to <a href="http://eshop.macsales.com/tech_center/support/rebates/memory.cfm">Other World Computing</a> you could get $37.00 for 8GB of MacBook Pro ram from either Apple or their own OWC brand.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>This trade in value would get your cost for 16GB of MacBook Pro RAM down to under $100 to double your ram in your Apple notebook from 8GB to 16GB, and as I have stated before, unless you are doing very CPU intensive work then **16GB of RAM will be all the RAM you ever need. **</p>

<h2 id="apple-memory-ram-costs">Apple Memory RAM Costs</h2>

<p>The bummer with Apple memory is that replaceable memory modules are going the way of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodo">Dodo bird</a>. If you have a MacBook Pro newer than 2012 you had better have upgraded it when you bought it because otherwise you are out of luck and stuck with your current amount of RAM.</p>

<p>This holds true for Apple MacBook Air models that have **never been able to accept a ram upgrade **and on the desktop front, this applies to the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00746X7G2/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00746X7G2&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkId=F6XSHGULSJDLX6L4">2014 Mac Mini</a> too. The only Apple computers you can upgrade are the Apple iMacs and Mac Pros, and I would not be surprised if you will soon not be able to upgrade the iMacs much further either. I think that in the future iMacs will come preconfigured with RAM upgrades just like the notebooks and that just leaves the Mac Pros that can accept a memory upgrade.</p>

<h2 id="windows-8-ram-upgrade-costs">Windows 8 RAM Upgrade Costs</h2>

<p>If you’re in the market for a memory upgrade for a windows or PC notebook you might have better luck with getting a ram upgrade for your Windows notebook but even this is changing over time. Some of the most popular windows PC’s like the <a href="http://Enter URLhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00RY4X8A4/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00RY4X8A4&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkId=KMYUJFUIAI4WTQBP">2015 Dell XPS</a> and the <a href="http://Enter URLhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00SGS7ZH4/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00SGS7ZH4&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkId=VJQZSSQRZK3GR4I4">Asus X305</a> notebooks cannot take an upgrade as like the Apple notebooks the RAM is soldered onto the motherboard.</p>

<p>The minimum memory requirements for <a href="http://Enter URLhttp://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/system-requirements">Windows 8 is just 2GB</a> but I think that is being a **little optimistic **in how much ram your notebook needs to run Windows well. I would think that you would want to have double the memory in a Windows notebook with at least **4GB of RAM. **</p>

<p>If you check the minimum ram on the Apple website it will too state that you need just 2GB of RAM for Mac OS but like the Windows 8 requirements I would not think about using a computer from Apple with at least 4GB of RAM, and preferably 8. Even the newer Apple MacBook ships with 8GB of RAM, but the MacBook Air models come with just 4GB so in 2015 I can suggest your computer come with at least 4GB of RAM.</p>

<p>This 4GB minimum of RAM really isn’t that hard to meet as there are many <a href="http://Enter URLhttp://www.amazon.com/s/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;field-availability=-1&amp;field-price-mp-owner-bin=00000-39999&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;node=565108&amp;pf_rd_i=565108&amp;pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_p=1952904682&amp;pf_rd_r=1Q3T80QS4YHJ1QKS3GD1&amp;pf_rd_s=merchandised-search-leftnav&amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkId=5ZDYFNBGPZIR7CE5">Windows notebooks under $400</a> that ship with <strong>at least 4gb of RAM</strong>, and if you spend more you get 8GB as the default so it’s not too hard to be sure you have 4GB of RAM in your notebook or desktop when you want to run Windows OS.</p>

<p>And if you have an older Mac or Windows machine you are really going to benefit from an upgrade from 2GB to 4GB if your machine can support it. It’s a great way to get some more mileage out of your older Mac or PC and yet the upgrade will<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001265GI2/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001265GI2&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkId=V57NWLW5TILQEHTY"> cost very little</a>.</p>

<h2 id="does-different-memory-types-cost-more">Does Different Memory Types Cost More?</h2>

<p>This really depends on the memory type you are looking to upgrade. If you are looking for the best prices for modern memory technology like DDR3 1600Mhz so-dimms or sdram for desktops then the prices for most brands with comparable sizes cost pretty much the same.</p>

<p>Where the costs do change is if you are looking to upgrade the RAM to performance memory for those that demand the best and fastest RAM you can buy and the extra cost is worth the extra performance. Gamers and Photographers are two groups that might prefer to have faster ram.</p>

<p>But if you’re the average user, just find a good brand of RAM like <a href="http://www.crucial.com">Crucial</a>, <a href="http://www.kingston.com">Kingston</a>, <a href="http://www.macsales.com">OWC</a> and other brands and you’re all set to go. Here’s a few examples of good prices on RAM for Mac or PC, desktop or notebook:</p>

<div id="asa-ea53b6e8ea1a21ecae33f6ca204d7d3d" class="asa_async_container asa_async_container_default">

<div id="asa-9d313e9cf199342e354365a3cc4e1da2" class="asa_async_container asa_async_container_default">
</div>

<p>To summarize, ram for Mac, Windows and Linux should not cost you a lot of money and with some shopping and trading in your old RAM you might be able to get all the ram you need to buy for $100. Just be sure to check with the memory manufacturer to be sure you can upgrade the RAM in your computer.</p>

    The MacBook Pro should be upgraded to 16GB. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008LTBJFW/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B008LTBJFW&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkId=RAUAQLS6NUZDS4NX"> check price </a>

</div>

<p>I was just pricing out a new MacBook Pro (the 13 incher) and noted that they really aren’t that expensive and also even though the RAM is not upgradeable on this model you can order it from Apple with 16GB vs the 8GB and I have to tell you: the prices Apple charges for RAM <strong>really isn’t that bad!</strong></p>

<!--more-->

<p>It was not too long ago that if you wanted to upgrade to 16GB from 8GB you could expect to pay a very pretty penny when you buy the<a href="http://store.apple.com/us/mac/mac-accessories/memory"> ram directly from Apple</a>, and for older Macs like 2012 MacBook Pros – one of the last MacBook Pro models that could take a user installable memory upgrade – this still seems to be the case, where Apple is currently charging over double what they should for a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005LDLVAO/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B005LDLVAO&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=ramseeker-20">comparable memory part. </a></p>

<p>But if you buy a 2015 Apple MacBook Pro and  then when you go to check out and bump up the ram to 16GB from 8GB at time of purchase, the ram price upgrade from <a href="http://store.apple.com/us/buy-mac/macbook-pro?product=MF839LL/A&amp;step=config#">8 to 16GB is just $200</a>, which is not outrageous like Apple RAM prices once were. At one time you would pay  a whole lot more money for 16GB of ram for the MBP if you were to buy it from Apple.</p>

<p>Take a look at the memory chart above: To upgrade to 8GB on an older 2012 and later model MacBook Pro, you will see that places like <a href="http://www.macsales.com">OWC</a>  and <a href="http://www.datamem.com">Data Memory Systems</a> are currently charging about  $140-$180.00 <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008LTBJFW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B008LTBJFW&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=ramseeker-20">for the  16GB memory upgrade kit</a> </strong>, but Apple charges $200 for half the amount of RAM at 8GB.</p>

<h2 id="is-a-16gb-ram-upgrade-from-apple-worth-it">Is a 16GB RAM Upgrade from Apple Worth It?</h2>

<p>So the question I need to ask is <strong>is it worth it to upgrade a 2015 MacBook Pro </strong>to 16gb when you buy it directly from Apple, and I have to say that this is the very first year I can say this with any sort of confidence, but yes it is.</p>

<p>Sure, you pay  a bit of Apple Tax on the ram upgrade compared to a 16GB kit for an older upgradable machine, but for the newest  MacBook Pros (and others) the only way to get to the maximum ram allowable for the Mac is to buy the ram at time of purchase from the <a href="http://store.apple.com">Apple Store</a> so you really only have one option anyway, and $200 for a 16GB ram upgrade is currently not that bad of a price.</p>

<h2 id="the-true-cost-of-a-20000-16gb-ram-upgrade-from-apple">The  True Cost of a $200.00  16GB RAM Upgrade from Apple</h2>

<p>But, then there’s the question of whether a ram upgrade of 16GB is worth it for a MacBook Pro vs the 8GB they ship with for the stock configuration, and  I think the answer is yes, and Ithink that the  $200 price increase is a worthy upgrade, and here’s why:</p>

<p><strong>Let’s choose the 2015 MacBook Pro with 2.7Ghz  and Retinal Display: </strong></p>

<p>Out of the box this model ships with 8GB of RAM and is priced at $1299.00, say $1300 for a round number. Add the 8GB upgrade to 16GB total and your new MacBook Pro  now costs $1500.00 with the more memory pre-installed.</p>

<p>Let’s assume you keep the MacBook Pro for 2 years. I think this is a very reasonable time to consider that you will stay with the same Apple computer. A 2017 MacBook Pro might be something completely different and will no doubt be faster and lighter than your once new 2015 model, but it should run most programs still and the latest operating system with ease. Unless you need to be on the bleeding edge of technology there’s no reason why you couldn’t get even more than 3 years out of it.</p>

<h2 id="the-math-what-a-16gb-macbook-pro-really-costs">The Math: What a 16GB MacBook Pro Really Costs</h2>

<p>Apple will happily finance the base model to you at $61.00 and change a month (on approved credit, etc). If you add the $200 option you are now raising  the financing cost ten dollars a month over the course of the term, which is in this example 24 months.</p>

<p>If you keep the MacBook Pro for 3 years, you’re paying  $500 a year to own your MacBook Pro. But that assumes your notebook has zero value at the end  of the 3 years and we know that’s not true and  it would not be hard at all to get a 50% trade in on your old Mac. This brings your costs down even further to $250.00 a year for 16GB 2015 MacBook Pro, or just over $20.00 a month for the 16GB model.</p>

<p>This is a current notebook with much more than <a href="http://www.lowendmac.com">three years of life in them</a>, and all it costs is about $20.00 a month. I think this is a pretty good deal for a MacBook Pro. If you’re a professional you can <strong>easily </strong>realize more than $20.00 a month with your notebook, and  even if you’re a student or a mommy blogger you can also get twenty dollars of value with a fast portable MacBook with a full amount of memory that just works.</p>

<p>This is why I suggest to <strong>always, always add the maximum amount of RAM</strong> you can to your computer. Even with the cost Apple charges for the upgrade, if you keep your computer in good shape it will have a very high resale value even a few years later and the true cost of owning your maxed out MacBook Pro will really only cost about the same as a few lattes from Starbucks every month.</p>

<p>It’s been some time since I wrote about the product MacBook as the last models were about 2010, but after half a decade of discontinuation, Apple’s <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbook/">announcement</a> changed all that and now if you’re going to buy a new Apple notebook computer in 2015 you have to ask your self – <strong>MacBook or MacBook Pro?</strong></p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="macbook-pros">2015 MacBook Pros</h2>

<h3 id="less-weight">Less Weight</h3>

<p>The benefits of the 2015 MacBook are more than a few, but the most obvious change for this <strong>brand new notebook from Apple</strong> is the size and weight of the notebook compared to other notebooks in this class. At just 2lbs in weight, this is the lightest notebook you can buy today from Apple, aside from buying an iPad and using it with an Apple Keyboard, but that’s really a different story compared to the MacBook because the iPad runs on a completely different operating system and as such is not really a fair comparison and some would argue that even with a keyboard the iPad is not a real computer (some would <a href="http://www.macstories.net/stories/ipad-air-2-review-why-the-ipad-became-my-main-computer/">argue differently</a>).</p>

<h3 id="less-ports">Less Ports</h3>

<p>So with the release of the Apple MacBook we have not only lightness compared to the MacBook Pro but also a completely different design that removes almost all the ports. Unlike the MBP, the MacBook Air offers just two ports – one for power via a USB-C connector and a headphone jack. <strong>That’s it.</strong> This could be considered a pro or con depending on the user but for my needs, which is mostly writing articles just like this one – I don’t need to connect anything to a computer other than perhaps a wireless mouse, but if I really needed to I could buy a bluetooth mouse to use.</p>

<p>I am going to call the lack of ports a pro because with the advent of dropbox and Google Drive and other cloud computing hosts, there’s no real need for external hard drives and usb flash sticks. One thing I might miss would be a SD card reader, but a lot of the higher end and even enthusiasts cameras now include wi-fi, so that’s not even a big deal. And, if you do need to hang some accessories off the 2015 MacBook there are <a href="http://www.belkin.com/us/Device/Mac/d/MacBook/">dongles you can buy.</a> that will allow you to work with memory cards and other USB 2.0 and USB 3.0 legacy devices</p>

<h3 id="better-keyboard">Better Keyboard</h3>

<p>The keyboard. I have not been able to test the keyboard of the MacBook but I think that after getting used to the new design with the butterfly keys vs the scissor style keyboards that have been around for a decade or more, this should be a better designed keyboard, assuming you can get used to the less travel than traditional keyboards</p>

<h3 id="better-battery-life">Better Battery Life</h3>

<p>The new MacBook is rated at up to 9 hours of battery life, which is not as good as the ten hours of life the MacBook Pro is spec’d at but for a small computer that weighs just 2lbs this is really good all day battery performance on this new 2015 Apple notebook.</p>

<h3 id="better-display">Better Display</h3>

<p>The MacBook offers a 12 inch retina display, but is a bit deeper (or taller) than the MacBook Pro’s thanks to the 16:10 ratio vs the 16:9 ratio of the MacBook Pro models. You might not think this would be a big deal, but if you’re like me and spend pretty much all your time in a document or web, you will appreciate the deeper display for <strong>less scrolling</strong> that allows you too keep your hands on the keyboard vs the mouse or trackpad.</p>

<h2 id="macbook-pro-pros">2015 MacBook Pro Pros</h2>

<p> </p>

<p>The 2015 MacBook Pros have a few advantages over the 2015 MacBook:</p>

<h3 id="bigger-screen-sizes">Bigger Screen Sizes</h3>

<p>Even the smallest MacBook Pro has a 13 inch display vs the 12 inch display on the MacBook, and if you want to go bigger you can even buy a 15 inch MacBook Pro too. Of course, these MacBook Pros are heavier than Apple’s new light netbook, but if you need a bigger display in a portable from the fruit company, then your only options are MacBook Pro models.</p>

<h3 id="faster-processors-for-more-speed">Faster Processors for More Speed</h3>

<p>The MacBook is not designed to be the fastest Apple notebook you can buy and features a pretty lightweight Intel Core M processor vs the Intel Core i5 and i7 options on the pro. If you do heavy duty stuff with your computer than the Pro is the computer you want to buy.</p>

<h3 id="bigger-battery-life">Bigger Battery Life</h3>

<p>It’s not much, but the MacBook Pro Battery life is rated at 10 hours vs 9 for the MacBook. It’s not a big difference and in some cases might not matter at all but if you need every bit of portable power you can than the MBP is the notebook from Apple you need for all day portable power.</p>

<h3 id="more-ports">More Ports</h3>

<p>The MacBook Pros are equipped with the ports we exepect on a professional computer like USB 3.0, HDMI, SD card readers, thunderbolt ports and so on. If you have stuff you want to connect to your MacBook Pro and hate the idea of dongles hanging off your MacBook you need to spring for the Pro version of this computer.</p>

<h3 id="mag-safe-power">Mag Safe Power</h3>

<p>One of the best ideas Apple ever had was the Magsafe connector that disconnected if the cable was pulled. This has saved countless accidents from people tripping over power cables and has saved my bacon on more than one occassion. I hope the omittance of Mag Safe connector on the new MacBook Pro is just a temporary thing.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>To summarize, both of these portable Apple computer lines offer different things for different people. If you need the lightest computer from Apple you can possibly get, then the Apple MacBook is for you, assuming you can live with the less ports and power. But if you’re a power user the MacBook Pro is only 3.5lbs, which is still a considerable weight loss compared to older models. If you need speed, a bigger screen size and all the ports you could ask for then the MacBook Pro is the computer to buy.</p>

    The first place you should check for a refurbished Mac is <a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple</a>
  </p>
</div>

<p> </p>

<p>One of the best ways to get deals on an Apple computer is to <strong>buy an Apple Refurbished Model</strong> vs buying a new Apple computer because you will save money on an Apple notebook or desktop and in most cases you will not be able to tell the difference between new or refurbished Apple computers.</p>

<p>This also applies to iPhones and iPads and even Apple accessories too because just because it’s not new doesn’t mean you can’t get a great deal on a previously Apple item regardless of what that may be. Here’s a few places to look for refurbished Apple computers.<!--more--></p>

<h2 id="apple"><a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple</a></h2>

<p>This one is pretty obvious I think and in most cases I find that for the newer models especially or even the just discontinued Macs and iPads that the Apple Store itself tends to have some of the best prices on refurbished computers and you can be sure that these computers that ship from Apple are rerfurbished correctly. Heck, Apple even calls these <a href="http://store.apple.com/us/browse/home/specialdeals/mac">Certified Refurbished</a> and they come with free shipping and a one year warranty too making these the best deals on Mac products.</p>

<p>The savings depend on the model but expect the savings to be in the area of 15-20% off. Some examples of current refurbished deals are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Refurbished 13.3 inch MacBook Pro for $929.00</li>
  <li>Refurbished Mac Mini 2014 for $419.00</li>
  <li>Refurbished MacBook Pro 15.4 inch for $1489.00</li>
</ul>

<p>These deals come and go all the time but the three above are discounted about 15% off and still have a full one year warranty from Apple. It’s really hard to beat buying a refurbished product directly from Apple.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2 id="amazon"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;field-keywords=refurbished%20apple%20laptop&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;sprefix=refurbished%20a,aps,209&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;url=search-alias=aps&amp;linkId=LRTZDJ5QJ7HL4U2L">Amazon</a></h2>

<p>Amazon is also a good source for refurbished Mac computers due to the sheer size of the Amazon marketplace. Unlike Apple that tends to sell refurbished models that have been <strong>just</strong> discontinued or even current, the Amazon refurbished models are available on an entire lineup of Apple products regardless of year and are available from a vast array of vendors. If you need an older Mac and want to buy refurbished Amazon is a good place to check for deals.</p>

<h2 id="other-world-computing"><a href="http://www.macsales.com">Other World Computing</a></h2>

<p>OWC has been in the business of serving the Apple community for over 25 years so there’s no hesitation on my part to suggest you check out not only their memory and ram upgrades for both new and used Apple products but also their selection of <a href="http://eshop.macsales.com/shop/Apple_Systems/Used/Macs_and_Tablets">refurbished Apple products</a>. At the time of writing this, Mac Mini models start at under699 with MacBook Air refurbished models available at just $519.00 and up. Inventory changes all the time at OWC when it comes to refurbished and used Macs so be sure to check regularly for the most current deals.</p>

<h2 id="mac-of-all-trades"><a href="http://www.macofalltrades.com">Mac of All Trades</a></h2>

<p>Mac of All Trades is another store worth checking out if you’re in the market for a refurbished Mac to buy. In business for over 20 years this vendor specializes in used and refurbished Apple products and current examples of pricing include factory sealed MacBook Pro models for400.00</p>

<h2 id="mac-mall"><a href="http://www.macmall.com/n/Refurb-Outlet/macNavLinks-macNavLinks.57">Mac Mall</a></h2>

<p>MacMall is another place to check for refurbished Apple Macs and other items and like the other vendors above has been in business for years and years so you know you can get an Apple product you can save money on from a store you can trust. In addition to refurbished products MacMall always has a deal or two on new Macs too so be sure to <a href="http://www.macmall.com/n/Black-Friday/macCustomPages-1007">check this out too</a><br />
‘</p>

<h2 id="ebay"><a href="http://www.ebay.com">eBay</a></h2>

<p>Of course, there’s also eBay and you might be able to find a deal on a used Mac that might be refurbished by either the factory or more likely sold as seller refurbished, meaning that the vendor bought the Macs in bulk and then cleaned them up or made any needed repairs . The disadvantage of the eBay vendors is that the experience can vary greatly between vendors and you really have to do your homework on buying used or refurbished Macs at auction. But, you can get some good deals and most every product is protected by eBay’s money back guarantee.</p>

<p>To summarize, I would check with <a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple</a> first to see if I can buy the Mac I want as a refurbished model, and if I could wait I would wait until the model I wanted to buy was in stock. Some refurbished models tend to sell very quickly – like Mac Mini’s so you might be out of luck when you want to buy one but if you are patient the products usually tend to show up again on the certified refurbished page so you still might be able to save about 15% or so on the Mac you want to buy.</p>

  </p>
</div>

<p>When shopping for a Mac Mini in 2015, one of the things you do not have to worry about are ram upgrades you can do your self because on the 2014 Mac Mini models you cannot upgrade the ram on your Mac Mini yourself. This means if you are looking to buy an Apple Mac Mini of the 2014 model you better be sure you buy the model with enough RAM for your needs, and for this year that means you can buy a new Mac Mini with 4GB, 8GB or 16GB maximum ram that’s soldered on the motherboard and that means you can’t upgrade the ram yourself.</p>

<!--more-->

<p><strong>The 4GB Mac Mini</strong></p>

<p>The 4GB Mac Mini for 2014 is the cheapest Mac Mini you can buy this year but it also has the lowest when it comes to ram maximums and this relatively minor amount of RAM might mean you might want to consider adding more RAM to the Mac Mini via the Apple Store at the time of purchase. But then your cheap Mac Mini that was under $500 is now much more expensive and you might be better off buying:</p>

<p><strong>The 8GB Mac Mini</strong></p>

<p>The 8GB Model is priced under $700 and not only do you get more RAM for the price you also get some other features like a faster processor, and larger hard drive. If you need even more RAM for your Mac Mini (in most cases, 8Gb would be enough for everyday use) then you might consider adding more RAM to the 8GB model to max out the Mac Mini to 16GB, or you could buy:</p>

<p><strong>The 16GB Mac Mini</strong></p>

<p>Where to Buy RAM for 2012 and Later Mac Mini</p>

<p>If you have an older Mac Mini or are considering buying one due to the fact that these later models allow you to swap out the RAM and hard drives yourself easily (the hard drive upgrade on the Mac Mini can take a bit of work) then you’re best off buying the Mac Mini RAM yourself and upgrading the RAM on your own to both speed up your Mac and get greater longevity from it too. It’s not uncommon to have ten year old Mac Mini models still in use, and I wonder if this will be the case on the most recent models?</p>

<p>The Mac Mini RAM you need to buy depends on year and model or even part number so you’re best to refer to a <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/2012/05/who-has-the-best-memory-finder/">memory compatability chart</a> or if you prefer, I have a page dedicated to helping you find the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/2014/10/mac-mini-memory-upgrade-prices/">right RAM for your Mac Mini</a> and once you know the type of RAM you need for the Mac Mini then all you need to do is to check the ram prices on Mac Mini RAM for your compatible model. Most recent Mac Mini models like the 2011 and 2012 models use <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/2014/10/mac-mini-memory-upgrade-prices/#ddr3-1600-mhz-memory-upgrade-prices">DDR3 1600Mhz memory</a> and the prices for RAM for these are reasonable and can be found at the following stores that sell memory for Mac Mini models:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">Amazon</a><br />

<a href="http://www.memoryx.net">Memory X</a><br />
<a href="http://www.oempcworld.com">OEMPCWORLD</a></p>

<h2 id="the-best-ram-for-apple-mac-mini">The Best RAM for Apple Mac Mini</h2>

<p>Regardless of what store you buy Mac Mini RAM from you need to buy memory from a reputable manufacturer like Kingston Memory or Crucial Memory and you need to be sure it is compatible for your Mac Mini Model. Again, if you have a current 2012-2011 Mac Mini the ram you need to buy is here:</p>

<p>This is a reputable brand name (Crucial) and is a pretty good price for 16GB of RAM for the Mac Mini right now. If you need to buy less than 16GB of RAM then the 8GB RAM for Mac Mini is currently priced at under $100 and is a great way to upgrade the older Mac Mini models which tended to ship with as little as 2GB of RAM so an 8GB RAM upgrade will quadruple the memory in these models:</p>

Unlike the MacBook Pro models that currently max out at 16Gb, the newer Apple iMac models can accept up to 32GB of RAM. <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/2014/10/apple-imac-memory-upgrade-prices/">See my chart</a> to see if your iMac can add that much ram, and if it can be sure to max out your RAM.</p>

<p>You will need to buy at least one 16GB RAM Upgrade kit for Apple iMac to get to the 32GB maximum. This depends on what your iMac shipped with from the factory. If you already have 16Gb of RAM you can just add another 16GB to get to the 32GB Max. Here’s a suggestion for an iMac 16GB RAM upgrade:<!--more--></p>

<p>This ram upgrade will work in the newest 5K retina iMac as well as some other models too from 2010 to 2013 as well so again, be sure to check my iMac ram compatibility chart to see how much RAM you can handle.</p>

<p>Don’t forget that if you need to replace the iMac ram you already have that you <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/2011/01/where-can-i-sell-old-ram/">can trade ram in</a> and get the ram even cheaper. There’s not a whole lot of memory stores that accept ram trades for older Macs but some do and it’s worth it to check it out if you’re not going to used the pulled ram when you upgrade.</p>

<p>My usual list of where to buy iMac RAM also applies to other Apple models too because in most cases if you have a relatively modern Mac from say the last 3 years or so, they <strong>all take the same memory upgrade</strong> so this advice on where to buy ram for iMac could also apply to MacBook Pro ram and Mac Mini Ram too because it’s all the same and the only difference is <strong>how much ram they can take</strong></p>

<p> </p>

<h2 id="imac-memory-upgrade-stores">iMac Memory Upgrade Stores</h2>

<p>The ram upgrade I linked to above is a memory upgrade from Amazon and it’s made by Crucial. Both the store or the brand don’t need an introduction and if you’re in the market to buy crucial ram over some other brand I find that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;field-keywords=crucial%20ram&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;sprefix=crucial%20ram,aps&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;url=search-alias=aps&amp;linkId=ISXRPOVF5JPSRMSF">best prices for Crucial ram</a> are from Amazon, and even though Crucial has their own online store you will tend to pay more there vs Amazon.</p>

<h2 id="crucial"><a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-1548159-10273954">Crucial</a></h2>

<p>Despite the fact that you can usually get a better deal from Amazon then you can from the Crucial store, the advantage of the Crucial store is their help in getting you the right ram. With Amazon (and to an extent some other vendors) you have to know what you are looking for but with Crucial there are numerous ways to find the right ram for your Apple iMac: You can use an Apple memory configurator or you can even download a little program you can run on your iMac that will tell you exactly how much and what type of RAM you need.</p>

<h2 id="owc"><a href="http://www.macsales.com">OWC</a></h2>

<p>Other World Computing needs no introduction to the Apple community and has been selling ram for iMacs since Day One of the first iMac release. OWC offers an easy to navigate site that makes it easy to find the right ram for your iMac and offers help in finding exactly what model of iMac you have as well as installation videos to help you upgrade the iMac ram yourself.</p>

<h2 id="data-memory-systems"><a href="http://www.datamemorysytems.com">Data Memory Systems</a></h2>

<p>Another memory upgrade store that’s been around for a very long time is Data Memory Systems and they offer ram for each and every Apple iMac model too. I find pricing to be very competitive and in most cases this memory upgrade store has some of best prices on iMac RAM at times.</p>

<h2 id="memoryx"><a href="http://www.memoryx.net">MemoryX</a></h2>

<p>Billed as the <strong>World’s Largest Memory Store</strong> MemoryX boasts to have the biggest memory selection and they just might be right. You should have no problem finding a ram upgrade for each and every iMac made – or any other Apple product you might want to add a memory upgrade to.</p>

<p>These are just a few of the best places to buy ram for Apple iMacs – regardless of year made.</p>
