   <B> <h1><a href="/2015/04/april-1-2015/">April 1, 2015</a></h1></B>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content">I have long been curating ram prices online and now it&#8217;s time for a new approach. I have tried different approaches as the demand for ram prices have declined now that Apple and a lot of other manufacturers don&#8217;t allow for ram upgrades to be done by the end user but nothing has really resonated with me to date.

I had thought about just writing articles about Apple and the like, but I am no news site nor do I have the time or interest to grab all the news. Also, my interests are widespread and not just Apple. I am interested in books, photography and other subjects just like you are, and over the course of the day I tend to visit these sites related to these topics and some times they have good stuff that at very least is worth a look and this is where I plan to do this from now on, and link out as much as I can

If you&#8217;re interested in just Apple news curated there a a lot of sites that do it better than I ever could like [Macintouch][1], [Macsurfer][2] for news and [MacPrices][3] and [DealMac][4] for deals on Apple stuff and more but I need to have a place to share the stuff I find online in addition to just tracking ram prices and I figure that April Fool&#8217;s day is the perfect time to start such an adventure.

From time to time I may write an article or two when I have a thought or idea that I want to expand on further, but I will stick to what I do best &#8211; and that&#8217;s curate the stuff that interests me &#8211; just like ram and memory prices did so many years ago when I first started this site. And speaking of ram prices, I **will still track them** and you can find the perfect ram for your Mac from the menus on the top of the page just like always. Whether you&#8217;re looking to upgrade the ram on a ten year old iBook or the latest iMac (one of the few Apple computers you can still add ram upgrades to) there will still be a memory upgrade price chart for you to check. RAM price updates are not going anywhere.

One recent article was about trying to get internet on his color classic. It&#8217;s [worth the click][33] just to see those old screenshots of OS&#8217;s gone by.

The Apple iPhone 4 and 4s models are pretty old now in 2014 but that doesn&#8217;t mean that they are two old for use or that they won&#8217;t make a good secondary phone or if you don&#8217;t need to have the fastest iPhone out there you can get some pretty good deals on older Apple iPhone 4 and iPhone 4S models.

## Do you need iOS 8?

The big difference between the two phones, and the first I want to mention is support for iOS 8. If you&#8217;re on the fence between the two models is that the 4 taps out at iOS 7 but the 4s can run iOS 8. There have been a lot of improvements to iOS 8 from iOS 7 but if you&#8217;re a casual user of your iPhone the 4s still runs the latest OS and can be bought for under $200.00.

## How Much Do You Want To Spend on an Apple iPhone?

The Apple iPhone 4 will be the cheaper option and because this phone does not run the latest operating system there&#8217;s less demand for these phones, yet they&#8217;re still perfectly fine for some and the best part is they can be bought for under $100.00

&nbsp;

<div id="asa-42a76b9a3a38eb8015e48819779a2503" class="asa_async_container asa_async_container_default">
</div>



## What iPhone Features Do You Need?

The big difference between the two iPhone models are besides the operating system is speed. The Apple iPhone 4s features an A5 Apple processor while the Apple iPhone offers an A4 processor that&#8217;s half as fast as the newer iPhone.

Do you need the speed? If you&#8217;re looking to run iOS 8 vs iOS 7 then the answer is yes. If you&#8217;re okay with saving money on an older iPhone and can live with iOS 7 then the slower iPhone might not feel all that slower in real life.

## Hello, Siri?

The iPhone 4s supports Siri while the iPhone 4 doesn&#8217;t.

These 3 features are the three main items that differentiate the two models.

If you&#8217;re looking to buy a budget or refurbished phone, the Apple iPhone 4s is the phone I suggest you buy. The older iPhone 4 does not offer the speed to run the latest OS and the other features and would be my biggest disappointment. Add to the fact, the older iPhone 4 is much slower and the iPhone 4 does not look like a bargain.

Rerfurbished Apple iPhone 4s models can be bought for under $200 in most cases &#8211; a fraction of what it would cost to buy an iPhone 6, and yet both of these phones pretty can run the same OS and offer the same user experience for the most part.

    The 2014 Mac Mini can&#8217;t take a RAM Upgrade so be sure to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00746XJLK/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=390957&#038;creativeASIN=B00746XJLK&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;tag=ramseeker-20&#038;linkId=OSC3RLAR5UQ3O5N6">buy the Mac Mini </a>with the Maximum RAM.
  </p>
</div>

  
The short answer? None. 

Much to the dismay of many the 2014 Mac Mini **cannot accept any upgrades** from the user. The only way to max out the RAM on the Mac Mini is to buy a Mac Mini with more ram at time of purchase. This is a shame, because now instead of being able to extend or improve the performance of your 2014 Mac Mini you’re out of luck and over time the amount of RAM you have in this model may affect how long you end up keeping the Mac Mini over time.

## 2014 Mac Mini Configurations {#2014-mac-mini-configurations}

<div id="asa-82259ab4ad9b62e011423f15c5787b2e" class="asa_async_container asa_async_container_default">
</div>



There are a few configurations of Mac Mini you can buy with different amounts of bot RAM and storage, with the maximum ram for the 2014 models capping out at 16GB for all models. Essentially the starting point for ram in the latest Mac Minis are either 4GB or 8GB with the option to add more RAM up to the 16GB Maximum 

## The Cost of a 2014 Mac Mini RAM Upgrade {#the-cost-of-a-2014-mac-mini-ram-upgrade}

The cheapest Mac Mini ships with just 4GB of RAM as standard with 8GB and 16GB uprade options priced at 200 increments. Adding 8GB of RAM to this model will cost 300 making this desktop anything but cheap. If you add the maximum ram to this model you are looking at a 60 percent price increase **just for the ram upgrade** alone.

Compare a [16GB ram upgrade][1] for the last and now discontinued 2012 Mac Mini and you’re looking at a premium of $200 over what you would pay if you could upgrade the ram yourself. 

## Faster Mac Mini RAM Upgrades {#faster-mac-mini-ram-upgrades}

Adding more ram to the faster 2.6Ghz and 2.8GHz gets a bit better because these models ship with 8GB of ram as standard equipment out of the box, and adding or doubling the memory to 16GB only adds 200 price upgrade vs the $300 Apple charges to add more RAM to the Cheaper Mac Mini. 

## Is a 2014 Mac Mini Upgrade Worth It? {#is-a-2014-mac-mini-upgrade-worth-it}

That’s a good question. The 2014 models are the latest and theoretically the fastest Mac Minis you can buy but the price of RAM can be 3x or more the cost, and when you consider the price of the RAM upgrade you have to compare prices of all the Mac Minis to see what the best price point for you might be. 

The cost to max out the 1.4GHz costs 799 from 200 for the same upgrade and results in a price bump from 899.00, and the price for the 2.8GHz models jump from 1199.00. 

## What’s the best deal for a 2014 Mac Mini? {#whats-the-best-deal-for-a-2014-mac-mini}

Based on the pricing above I would say the 2.6GHz model with 16GB of RAM is the best value for a Mac Mini in 2015, as it’s only $100 more than the cheaper model yet offers a much faster processor of 2.6Ghz vs the 1.4Ghz on the model that costs less. 

## Should You Buy the Mac Mini with the Maximum RAM? {#should-you-buy-the-mac-mini-with-the-maximum-ram}

Only if you think you need it. In my personal case, I could do with the bare minimum of 4GB the $500 Mac Mini as I basically live in a text editor, and [according to Apple][2] it only takes 2GB of RAM to run the Yosemite OS so I should be okay with the 4GB of ram limit, and don’t think it would be worth it to buy the 8GB ram version. But if you do any photo editing or work with video then you’re better off with the 2.6 or 2.8Ghz versions maxed out to 8GB of RAM. 

To Summarize, the Mac Mini is a good cheap computer from Apple, but if you need more RAM you’re looking at spending at least 100 and current street prices are about $80.00 for ram from reputable vendors so the twenty dollar premium to go from 4GB to 8GB is a good idea, but when it comes to adding 16GB of RAM on the 2014 models, it gets a little pricey.

    If you want to upgrade a 2014 Mac Mini, you&#8217;re out of luck. But older models can accept both hard drive and ram upgades and are a great way to add more life to your older Mac Mini
  </p>
</div>

Updating a Mac Mini is a great way to get more life or faster speed or more storage out of your Mac Mini and here&#8217;s a few suggestions to enhance your computing experience when using the Apple Mac Mini:

## 2014 Mac Mini

With the 2014 Mac Mini, you&#8217;re pretty much screwed when it comes to upgrades &#8211; at least internally. If you want to upgrade the ram or storage space on a 2014 Mac Mini be sure to do it at the time you order your Mac Mini or you will be stuck with the configuration for the entire time you own the 2014 model.

You can upgrade the Mac Mini externally by adding an external SSD like the [Samsung T1 External SSD][1] which will allow you to add more storage via the Mac Mini&#8217;s USB port. These are currently available in 250GB, 500GB and 1TB sizes and are a cheap way to get more storage space on your Mac.

<!--more-->

## 2012 Mac Mini

[check ram prices][2]

The 2012 Mac Mini has been one of the most popular Mac Mini models due to the fact that it&#8217;s the last upgradable Mac Mini Apple has made so you&#8217;re able to upgrade the [Mac Mini RAM][3] and the hard drive on the Mac Mini to a maximum of 16GB for the RAM and whatever size you want for the solid state storage.

If you&#8217;re looking to swap out the hard drive of the Mac Mini for faster SSD storage, the [Samsung 850 Evo SSD][4] models are a good choice and start at under $100.00 for 128GB and go up from there. If you want to max out the SSD storage on your Mac Mini to 1TB you should expect to pay about $400 or so.

And if you don&#8217;t need the fast storage space of a solid state drive for your Mac Mini then you can add more space via a traditional hard drive. The [Western Digital Blue][5] line of hard drives is an excellent choice and a 1TB drive can be had for under $50 at times.

## 2011 Mac Mini

[check ram prices][6]

The 2011 Mac Mini can be upgraded exactly the same as the 2012 mode with a few caveats: The memory you need to buy for the 201 model differs from later models and requires the use of DDR [1333Mhz sodimms][7] vs the [1600MHz sodimms][8] of the 2012 models.

Technically, Apple suggests just 8GB of RAM for the Mac Mini for this model year but you can squeeze 16GB into these models as well.

When it comes to hard drive upgrades on the Mac Mini for 2011, see my suggestions for the 2012 models as they apply here as well for the 2011 versions.

## 2010 Mac Mini

[check ram prices][9]

The 2010 Mac Minis max out at 8GB of RAM vs the 16GB max for later models an use slower 1066Mhz speed. The good news is even though you can only max out the memory on the 2010 models, you can get the 8GB upgrade for well under $100 and is a pretty cheap upgrade for your older aging Mac Mini that is now five years old.

## 2009 Mac Mini

[check ram prices][9]

The fact that these Mac Minis can run the [latest version of the Mac OS][10] operating system is one reason to squeeze more life out of these six year old computers from Apple. You will need to buy 8GB of 1066 DDR3 ram for the 2009 models.  
Adding an internal hard drive is a bit trickier than the earlier models [but it can be done.][11]

## 2007 Mac Mini

The 2007 Mac Minis are definitely starting to show their age, but can still take more ram. &#8211; up to 4GB, even though the official suggestion by Apple is just 2GB. 4GB of ram is crazy cheap for these and you may want to consider [buying used ram][12] for these older models because you might even get it cheaper.

Be sure to buy DDR2 667Mhz sodimms for all 2007 Mac Mini models.

Hard Drive Upgrades are the same as the 2009 models.

## 2006 Mac Mini

You can squeeze 4GB of ram into a 2006 Mac Mini, which is kind of amazing considering that this computer is now closing in on a decade when it comes to age. You will need to buy DDR2 667Mhz memory for this model too &#8211; essentially all that the 2007 models require can be used here too.

## 2005 Mac Mini

(see upgrades for all 2006 Models)

With the 2005 Mac Mini models you&#8217;re now looking to add an upgrade to a ten year old computer and I might suggest that you add a new computer to use vs an upgrade. But, if you&#8217;re fine with the 2005 model for your needs, the 2005 model can only handle 1GB of RAM.  
These PowerPC G4 Mac Minis cannot run a whole lot of software that&#8217;s current but it you do need to upgrade the ram on these models be sure to add DDR PC2700 memory upgrades for these models

  </p>
</div>

I’ve been thinking a lot about the Apple Mac Mini and I think the 2014 models have been [given][1] a [bum rap][2].

A google search will take you about 30 seconds to find more than one opinion piece about how the 2014 Mac Mini is **not the deal it once was** and that there’s no replaceable parts any more in the new Mac Mini and that the 2014 is one big disappointment from Apple.

Personally, I think that’s a good thing you can no longer open them up.

<!--more-->

## This Has Been Coming for Some Time.

Ever so slowly, Apple has been removing the ability to work on the innards of your new computer and this applies to almost the entire lineup for 2014 and beyond.

Chances are if you’re here looking for a ram upgrade it’s for an older Mac vs a newer one and you’re just trying to squeeze a bit more life out of your current model, because if you have a relatively new Mac made in the last year or two **you can’t upgrade it either**.

It’s no longer possible for you to upgrade almost every model Apple makes save for the iMac and the Mac Pro, and I think this is a good strategy on Apple’s part.

Portable computers are fragile enough without having them be user upgradeable and all the problems that come with that. On un-upradeable Macs, the RAM can be soldered down, hard drives don’t need to be swapped and batteries are non replaceable, and all this is because&#8230;

## Meet Apple: the Appliance Company.

It’s my opinion that Apple wants to sell you a **suitable computer for today** and they don’t want to sell you a computer you can use tomorrow.

In a perfect Apple world you would buy a new computer every time they announced one, but thankfully they make pretty good stuff that will last you for longer than that. It’s not uncommon to get [longer life][3] out of your computer and considering that Apple will allow you to finance a computer for 2 years that’s a good safe bet to how long you can use your Mac knowing you’re not too far behind the technology curve and your 2 year old Mac will do everything a new Mac can do.

This brings me back to the Mac Mini. It’s a cheap computer that’s easy to use with any monitor and keyboard and mouse. You can use it as a media server, [web server][4] or even just as it’s true intended use as a personal computer for home or small business for people like, well&#8230; me.

And the Mac Mini is perfect for that and now that it’s closed to upgrades this makes it perfect for this task as the lack of chance to upgrade makes it the only desktop computer from Apple that’s plug and play with **your accessories** and not theirs and yet you don’t have to worry about adding some more parts to the thing before you can use it.

You don’t have to buy a 5K monitor to use the Mac Mini. You can buy a cheap $100 (or less) monitor and add a $20 keyboard and mouse combo and you have a **brand new Apple desktop for under $600.00**

Lord knows you can [spend more on a desktop][5] and you get a much nicer display and faster processor but for a lot of us, myself included &#8211; we don’t need much when it comes to using a Mac. At least I don’t.

I don’t edit photos on my Mac when my iPad can do it better and faster.

All I need a Mac for is to write here on ramseeker and although I could use my [iPad as my only device][6] I really prefer a full sized display and keyboard at a desk. I work from home most of the time so a a cheap Apple desktop is fine by me.

## How Much Mac Do You Really Need To Buy?

In 2015 I think that the folks like me are the people that the Mac Mini will cater to. Personally, I just want a Mac that will run some current sofware for writing like [byword][7] or [desk][8] and that’s pretty much all I need. Add a browser and maybe an application or two like [skype][9] and I am good to go.

## It Just Works

The Mac Mini comes with enough ram (4gb) and enough storage space (500gb) and a fast enough processor (1.4GHz dual-core Intel Core i5) all wrapped in a small little package that fits behind your TV as well as it does on your desk. You don’t have upgrade it because it doesn’t need upgrading.

To me that sounds like the **perfect Apple product if there ever was one**

The Mac Mini has never been about speed. There’s [other macs for that][10] if you need to have the fastest Mac you can buy today. But if you’re just needing a small and cheap computer at under $500 it’s hard to beat the value of the Mac Mini regardless of it’s upgradability

This $500 computer can run the same software and operating system as the faster models. It might not run as fast but there’s a very good chance it will run. I can’t think of any software you could not run on the 2014 Mac Mini. You still get iTunes, Safari and Time Machine backups and all the other stuff Mac OS X includes for free and it all just works.

To summarize, I am fine with the non upgradeable Mac Mini. If I want a faster or lighter computer I will buy a MacBook Air or a 2015 MacBook. You can’t upgrade either of these [(unless you ask OWC)][11] but again, the idea here is to buy it and use it and get a newer model down the road. Apple wants to sell you an Appliance to use for a couple of years until they can sell you another one.

The beauty of the Mac Mini and a lot of Apple computers is the resale value. You can buy this 2014 Mac Mini, with it’s many perceived flaws and then when an upgrade comes you can sell your old Mac Mini and buy a new one and I bet you would only be out a couple of hundred dollars for the new model.

Would I love for the new Mac Mini to have a fast SSD and more RAM? Of course I would. But I don’t need either for my everyday and I bet a lot of others don’t either.

## More Options Are Available

If I do want more RAM or a faster SSD &#8211; I can have both of those. I just have to **pay Apple** (including the Apple tax) for them. This might mean I am now looking at a Mac Mini that costs twice the amount of the entry level model, and if I have a $1000 budget for an Apple computer then the game just changed.

With $1000 I can buy another entry level computer I like: the [MacBook Air][12] and get SSD storage, and the portability and display for even less than the souped up Mac Mini.

But I am not really here to talk about the Mac Mini that costs $1000. I am here to talk about the cheap model. The ‘everyman’s Mac’ if you will. The ‘good enough’ Mac for those of us who really don’t need the portability, speed or high resolutions displays that more expensive Macs might offer us and we just want a Mac that’s cheap and that works out of the box without any upgrades needed. The Mac Mini meets these requirements and then some.

At under $500 it’s a heck of a deal and the cheapest Apple computer you can buy in 2015.

After musing about what [apple notebook I would buy][1] I got to thinking: We all know the soon to be released Apple MacBook is the **lightest Apple computer ever** but what about the other models? How much do they weigh? Does more SSD hard drive space make a computer heavier? What about RAM? Does that make a computer heavier? Let’s have a look:

## The MacBook is the Lightest Apple Computer You can Buy {#the-macbook-is-the-lightest-apple-computer-you-can-buy}

So there you have it. The lightest Apple computer is the soon to be available MacBook followed by the MacBook Air 11 and 13 inch, and MacBook Pro 13 inch and 15 inch models

## The 27 inch iMac is the Heaviest Computer You can Buy {#the-27-inch-imac-is-the-heaviest-computer-you-can-buy}

The lightest desktop computer of course, is the Apple Mac Mini but curiously, the 2.8Ghz model is .1 lb heavier than the other slower Mac Mini models. Interestingly the weight of the Retina 5K iMac is the same weight as the the non-retina iMacs. I would have guessed that the better display would have to weigh more, but I guess resolution does not affect the weight of a computer.

## 15 inch MacBook Pros Still Weigh a Lot {#15-inch-macbook-pros-still-weigh-a-lot}

It’s surprising to see the weight of the MacBook Pros still weigh as much. A [PowerBook G4][2] that’s a **over a decade older** only weighs about a lb more, and my guess the big weight saving of that pound are from the removal of the optical drive and traditional hard drive that the new MacBook Pros no longer have. If MacBook Pros had to still have these two things I bet we would still see their weight be closer to six lbs like the PowerBooks were.

No wonder the MacBook Airs were so popular &#8211; the 11 inch was the lightest model you could buy until the new MacBook released a week or so ago and were **half the weight** of a 15inch MacBook Pro. I have slugged around enough 5lb notebooks to tell you that it’s no fun after a while on the back and shoulders.

## How Important is Notebook Weight? {#how-important-is-notebook-weight}

When it comes to the new MacBook and it’s lack of weight, I wonder how light a notebook needs to be? Yes, slogging a 5lb notebook around gets old but there’s a big tradeoff with the new MacBook for that little weight, and it’s no MacBook Pro. The screen is very nice, but the keyboard seems to take some time to adjust to and as has been discussed ad nauseum, the lack of ports might be a problem.

If Apple discontinues the MacBook Air lineup, then there’s a big weight jump between the 2lb MacBook and the almost 3.5 lbs the 13 inch MacBook Pro. Currently the MacBook Airs fill the 2-3lbs weight category quite nicely but the design is getting stale so I wouldn’t be surprised to see this lineup go sooner than later.

  </p>
</div>

  
I have been shopping for a new Mac recently and lately it&#8217;s come down to two choices:

## MacBook Pro vs MacBook Air

Both are really designed for different purposes and different price points and I would like to compare both and see what one would really fit my needs. I mostly just work with text now and really don&#8217;t need the extra cost of the MacBook Pro but when shopping for a new computer I like to sit down and write about what might be the best choice for me.

<!--more-->

##Pros for the MacBook Air

**Price**

I am leaning towards the 11 inch MacBook Air and probably the cheapest model. I am finding that I don&#8217;t need a whole lot of processing power in a notebook computer and the 11 inch MacBook Air retails for just $899.00 vs $1299.00 for the 13 inch MacBook Pro.

In both cases I would buy the cheaper of the two models. I find that with the technology changing so fast, unless you need the power the value of the higher end models is not worth it to me.

**Size**

The Macbook Air is smaller both in physical size and weight, and although I do the vast majority of my work at a desk it would be nice to tuck the notebook under my arm and use it as a portable computer from time to time, and the MacBook Pro is much heavier at almost 3.5 lbs vs the 2.4lbs of the MacBook Air.

That&#8217;s about all the MacBook Air has going for it for me &#8211; size and price, with price being the dominant factor. Assuming you get 2 years out of the MacBook Air, the financing works out to $43.00 a month or about $1.50 a day to get into the MacBook Air.

## Pros for the MacBook Pro

**The Display**

Not only is the display on the MacBook Pro bigger it&#8217;s **also better** on the MacBook Pro with it&#8217;s retina IPS display vs the older TN technology of the MacBook Air. If you&#8217;re going to stare at the Macbook Pro for hours on end then it might be worth it to spend the $400 premium of the Macbook Pro to get the much sharper and brighter retina display. The display also offers much more real estate, which I don&#8217;t think I really need. I just write and any display frankly will do me for the work I do. One might argue that the Macbook Pro offers more room to work but I don&#8217;t see the smaller MacBook Air display to be that big of a hindrance.

**The Speed**

This is another area the Macbook Pro will blow the doors off the MacBook Air. The MacBook Pro is fitted with a 1.6GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor vs the 2.7GHz dual-core Intel Core i5  
Turbo Boost up to 3.1GHz. If you need to do a lot of higher end work like image editing and video, both of these I don&#8217;t do &#8211; then it might be worth the upgrade

##Summary

The MacBook Air is smaller and cheaper, but slower and the display isn&#8217;t half as nice.

The MacBook Pro is faster and has a bigger and much nicer display.

You really can&#8217;t go wrong with both but if you&#8217;re just working with text like I tend to be lately you really can&#8217;t go wrong with the 11 inch MacBook Air as it&#8217;s the only Apple notebook you can buy new for under $1000. Even the fancy new and thin MacBook has a $1300 price tag.

Some may argue that the MacBook Air is older technology and is a 2010 computer filled with 2015 innards and not much else has changed. The screen is still sub par and much smaller but the weight and power and overall value of the MacBook Air is hard to beat at about $45.00 a month.

On the other hand if you can afford or justify the better display and the higher cost the MacBook Pro can be had for just $62.00 a month, or about two dollars a day over the 2 year finance rate. If you can cough up the extra $15.00 a month and need the more power and the much nicer display then the MBP is the way to go.

But for me, I really can&#8217;t justify the extra cost of the MacBook Pro when the MacBook Air looks to be the perfect blogging and writing machine and that&#8217;s what I tend to do the most of in 2015. I think I will spend my money on the Macbook Air this time around when buying a new Apple notebook this year.</div>

In 2015, there are many reasons to upgrade the ram in a laptop, but the most important is speed. Simply put, more ram makes your notebook or laptop run faster than it would without.

## What to look for in laptop ram

The first thing to look for when looking to add more memory to your notebook is whether you can upgrade or not. Some of the newer notebooks like the 2015 [MacBook][1] or the [Dell XPS 13][2] ship with the RAM soldered on the motherboard meaning you’re out of luck when it comes to upgrading so be sure to buy the most ram you can afford at the time of purchase.

But if you can upgrade the ram on your notebook computer it&#8217;s best to do so because ram is [pretty cheap these days][3] and in most instances you can upgrade the ram to twice what was installed in the computer.

## Apple Laptop RAM

One of the most [popular ram prices][4] I monitor memory prices for are Apple Computers. Some newer models **all have their ram soldered to the motherboard** so it you&#8217;re looking to upgrade ram on an Apple notebook prior to 2012 you&#8217;re pretty much out of luck.

## Dell Laptop RAM

I have mentioned earlier that the Dell XPS for 2015 cannot be upgraded but some older XPS models can be so like the Apple models you&#8217;re best to check out how much ram your notebook takes. The Dell consumer models like the Dell Inspiron models can take a ram upgrade and you can usually at least double the ram from 4GB standard to 8GB for well under $100.00

Dell Alienware models usually ship with all the ram they need as they are professional gaming computers and need all the performance and speed they can get and so have the ram installed at time of manufacturer.

Dell Latitude memory upgrades are available for current models as these are business models that are priced to be competitive in the market and one way of meeting a certain price point is to add the minimum amount of RAM and let the business or consumer&#8217;s IT department add more memory later if needed

## HP Laptop RAM

HP computers come in a wide array of models from entry level ultrabooks to high end gaming computers and they can all use a memory upgrade. Some might be soldered to the motherboard but a lot of ram upgrades are still available with common upgrade prices usually around the $100 mark for HP Laptop memory &#8211; maybe a bit more for 16GB HP notebook ram kits.

## RAM for Notebooks is Cheap in 2015

The prices for ram for notebook computers used to be much higher than they are now and cost a fraction of the price, but if you are looking to buy a ram upgrade for your notebook the cost will be about $75.00 for 8GB of RAM and $125.00 for 16GB of RAM for upgrading your laptop to the most ram it can handle.
