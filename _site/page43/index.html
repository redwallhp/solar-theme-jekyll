The iMac, in my opinion is probably the best value in an Apple Personal Computer, regardless of year. From the very first Apple iMac to the current Apple iMacs with Intel i3 and i5 processors, with the Apple iMac you get a well designed desktop computer that in it&#8217;s latest incarnation with the summer 2010 refresh also offers you a choice of processor speeds, screen sizes and price points but they all offer the same sleek design that hardly takes any room on your desktop.

**[Cheapest Apple iMac][1]**

One thing that the latest iMacs need (and with RAM so cheap these days, I don&#8217;t understand why Apple doesn&#8217;t ship the Apple iMac&#8217;s full of RAM) is more RAM. For a select few, the memory installed at the factory will be more than ample if you&#8217;re just surfing facebook or email or the like, but for the rest of us that want to get the most performance we can out of Apple&#8217;s best selling desktop computer, adding more memory is the cheapest way to do that and usually offers more bang per buck than adding hard drives or installing software could.

The best part about iMac memory upgrades, is that if you do it right you only do it once and the memory upgrade is good for the life of the computer. Fill your iMac with RAM, and forget about it. You can buy ram from Apple for the iMac, but even though more moderately priced than earlier years buying RAM direct from Apple is still a pricey proposition.

A better, and cheaper option is to buy iMac Memory from a memory store you can trust to offer the same technical specs required for the 2010 Apple iMacs but at a cheaper price. Most memory stores offer a lifetime guarantee free shipping and support in the rare case you do have trouble with your iMac RAM you know you will get the help you need. This is rarely needed as the memory shops test the RAM upgrades prior to shipping.

**Where to Buy iMac RAM and for the Cheapest Price.  
**

I don&#8217;t recommend any one specific memory store as I figure it&#8217;s your money you&#8217;re spending and you have different requirements about how much you will pay for ram, but also the perceived value attached with [brand name memory][2] and other factors to consider when buying RAM. But, most of you just want the cheapest iMac RAM and I have created a chart that lists the lowest memory prices from memory vendors you can trust.

The title of this article could be misunderstood or misread and that&#8217;s not what we want. To clarify: RAM or memory is a physical product. RAM is not a software upgrade or downloadable online. But, you can save a lot of money buying RAM online from a selection of online memory stores and it&#8217;s been my goal over the past ten years or so to help you get the best deal you can on memory upgrades, regardless of whether you need to buy RAM for your Apple, HP or Dell computer, just to name a few computer manufacturers and their products that will run much much faster when you add more memory.

[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1139" title="Best Selling Computer RAM" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-24-at-1.41.59-PM.png" alt="" width="312" height="292" />][1]

**[Best Selling Computer RAM][1]**

I&#8217;m going to assume you are in the market to save money on memory and RAM and want a fair price from a memory store you can trust to sell and ship you RAM upgrades fast and without any fuss or trouble. With RAM, there can be huge markups, especially when buying ram from the manufacturer directly, such as Dell or HP or even Apple. It&#8217;s convenient to buy memory from the computer manufacturer, but accessories are expensive and unless time is more important to you than money (which could be the case) it&#8217;s ill advised.

Your best bet when it comes to low priced ram upgrades is to buy RAM online from a trusted third party memory store. You will see to the right of this article that I have a list of the [best memory stores][2] and if that&#8217;s not a big enough list of options I have even [more memory sellers][3] you can choose from when you&#8217;re looking for the best price on your memory upgrades.

In most cases, the cheapest ram will be generic memory as opposed to name brand RAM upgrades. The difference between the two in most cases, besides ram prices &#8211; is the name brand RAM might be considered the better RAM due to the name, but that&#8217;s debatable and the generic memory upgrades are still made and tested to the computer manufacturers exact specifications, so in most cases you will be just fine by ordering generic RAM and saving money the next time you need to upgrade your notebook or desktop computer.

What do you get when you combine the best selling Apple MacBook with the most RAM or memory you can install in a current shipping MacBook Pro? A small, powerful &#8211; and thanks in part to the 8GB of RAM that maxes out the 13.3 inch MacBook Pro &#8211; notebook computer from Apple that has the most ram possible installed and in most cases, for less than $100 for MacBook Pro 8GB  
[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1149" title="Cheapest MacBook Pro" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-24-at-7.39.14-AM1.png" alt="Best MacBook Pro Price" width="283" height="223" />][1]

[table id=1 /]  
**[Best Priced MacBook Pro][1]**

You can even offset the the cost of 8GB MacBook Pro RAM by selling your old, or original memory that came installed in the MacBook Pro 13 inch back to [some][2] [memory][3] [manufacturers][4] who will take your older memory in as a trade where you offset the cost and get 8GB RAM for MacBook Pro even cheaper than you could if you bought the RAM

To max out the 13 inch MBP, you need to remove (in most cases) the 2 x 2GB memory modules in the two memory upgrade slots and replace them with 2x 4GB RAM for MacBook Pro. There&#8217;s quite a selection of best memory stores (see sidebar) to buy MacBook RAM from but to get the best price you should compare prices on both 4GB memory modules for MacBook Pro and also 8GB memory upgrade kits too as some stores only market their memory upgrades as ram modules, while others prefer to sell you a 8GB MacBook RAM Upgrade KIT which consists of two 4GB DDR3 1066 SDRAM memory modules for MacBook Pro

Stores I recommend for memory upgrades are [Crucial][5], [OWC][6], [Data Memory Systems][7], [18004Memory][8], [MemoryX][4] and [OEMPCWORLD][2]

There&#8217;s other memory stores but over the 14 yeas of tracking memory upgrades I find that these few stores support and sell quality Apple Memory Upgrades for less than what you would pay if you were to buy the RAM from Apple, which while convenient sometimes &#8211; is not the best way to save money on ram upgrades.

In 2011, it does not cost a lot of money for [apple memory upgrades][1], and in fact now is the perfect time to buy mac memory as RAM has never been cheaper than right now for Apple Computers.

[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1146" title="Best Selling Apple RAM" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-24-at-1.55.27-PM.png" alt="Best Apple RAM Price" width="308" height="237" />][2]

**[Best Selling Mac Memory][2]**

Let&#8217;s take a look at today&#8217;s RAM prices: As I write this you can [buy memory for MacBook Pros][1] for as little as $49 for 4GB of MacBook Pro memory, one of the best selling Apple notebooks available today. To maximize current memory on any modern MacBook Pro will need to replace the 4GB that ships as standard equipment when the MacBook Pro comes from Apple and replace it with 4GB memory modules x 2 for a total of 8GB of MacBook Pro RAM. To offset the cost of your MacBook Pro RAM there are many memory stores that will [buy back][3] your [old ram][4] and and credit you against the newer and larger memory upgrades &#8211; regardless of which Apple computer you need RAM for and making the memory for your Apple Computer even that much cheaper. It&#8217;s possible you could [upgrade the RAM on your Mac][5] for under $50 for most current shipping Apple computers &#8211; and even less if you&#8217;re looking to upgrade older Macs with cheaper and smaller ram modules.

When it comes to upgrading the memory on older Macintosh computers, you do need to be aware of the price and performance ratio, as some older Macs might not be worth it to add more memory to. Your computing dollar might be better spent on buying a new Mac, rather than upgrading the memory on an old computer where your performance dollar might be better spent.

Below are the best prices on Apple RAM for all current Apple computers such as Apple iMac, MacBook, MacBook Pro and Mac Pro

**Best and Cheapest RAM for MacBook Pro**

The Apple MacBook Pro might just very well be the most popular Apple computer made by Apple to date. Yes, it is priced more than the MacBook as the professional version of Apple&#8217;s notebook computer offers more features and benefits of the MacBook Pro. I won&#8217;t compare the MacBook against the MacBook Pro with this article as that&#8217;s not the point but the MacBook Pros do offer larger screen size, faster processor speeds and in my opinion, what is probabl the most important feature: the ability to add more RAM for even faster performance.

[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1149" title="Cheapest MacBook Pro" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-24-at-7.39.14-AM1.png" alt="Best MacBook Pro Price" width="283" height="223" />][1]

**[See Best Price on MacBook Pro][1]**  
[table id=1 /]

It makes no sense to me why you would buy the best notebook computer from Apple and then just leave it sit there with the RAM that came from the factory, when for under $100 you could maximize the performance of your MacBook Pro. This advice applies to both the latest and greatest MacBook Pros to the older MacBook Pros too that are just fine for simpler tasks like email, text editing and even [surfing facebook][2] if that&#8217;s your thing.

RAM Prices for Apple MacBook Pros are cheap and get a bit cheaper every day it seems and for less than a dinner out you can maximize the performance on your professional Apple Computer.

The MacBook, from Apple could arguably be the best notebook computer available today from Apple, as this consumer based laptop offers a small footprint and price/performance ratio that can&#8217;t be beat when compared to the big brother in the Apple lineup: The Apple MacBook Pro.

But for most consumers this small laptop is the perfect choice as the digital hub between your iPhone, iPod, and any other consumer electronic item &#8211; such as a digital camera. Most buyers of the Apple MacBook should upgrade the memory at time of purchase, and I recommend that unless you have money to burn that you save money on memory upgrades and buy ram from a cheaper third party, and since on the internet, price is king &#8211; I have gathered and created a chart of current ram prices for both new and old Apple MacBook models. The older MacBook models, up to about 2007 require and use PC5300 DDR2 SDRAM sodimms, while the later unibody macbooks can accept a much faster memory upgrade in the form of DDR3 1066mhz SDRAM sodimms.

Depending on the specific MacBook model you have you might be able to install either 2 or 4GB or memory as the maximum RAM amount &#8211; and on the older MacBook models it&#8217;s quite possbile to squeeze 3GB or 6GB in them although this is not supported by Apple and I cannot recommend this MacBook memory upgrade.

The Apple iMac has long been a top selling Apple Computer and one of the best methods to maximize or accelerate the performance of your Apple iMac is to add memory. One of the challenges when shopping for ram is where to buy Mac Memory? This is the question I answer all day, each and every day and so in the interest of answering your questions on where to buy cheap Apple memory for the iMac, I have put together this handy little chart below which will show you the current lowest price on RAM Memory for the different Apple iMac models. This is all the iMac models too, from the very first iMac running at 333Mhz to the latest iMacs in 2011 which now operate at ten times the speed of the original iMac.

The [best prices on RAM][1]. If there is a theme here at ramseeker it is that it&#8217;s my goal to help you get the best deal on RAM that you can. Yes, memory has dropped in price in recent times but it still costs money to upgrade your desktop or notebook computer, and in most cases it is your hard earned money you&#8217;re spending on RAM so of course you want to find the cheapest RAM price you can find when it comes to ram upgrades for either your notebook or desktop computer, and I can help.

[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1146" title="Best Selling Apple RAM" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-24-at-1.55.27-PM.png" alt="Best Apple RAM Price" width="308" height="237" />][2]

**[Best Apple RAM][2]**

What you need when it comes to shopping for memory upgrades is the right upgrade at the best price. That&#8217;s it. It&#8217;s nice to shop for name brand memory but it&#8217;s not needed unless you&#8217;re doing mission critical work with your computer, but for the most of us we&#8217;re just surfing the internet, or some other task such as [facebook][3] and using generic memory upgrades when shopping for RAM.

Why you want to look out for generic RAM as opposed to name brand memory is that for the most part &#8211; save for the little sticker on the ram module, there&#8217;s not a whole lot of difference between the two, except the price and it&#8217;s always been my policy to list the lowest price available for memory upgrades from the various memory manufacturers or resellers regardless of whether the memory is name brand or generic. If there&#8217;s an option, I have always tracked memory prices for generic ram as in most cases, generic memory is cheaper.

**Where to Buy Memory for the Best Price  
**  
Rather than list the lowest ram prices here I will direct you to a page that lists [memory stores][4] you can [buy ram ][1]from and you can make the choice yourself, or you can search for the [cheapest apple memory][5] or [cheapest PC memory][6] too.

The short answer is: **NO**

You cannot put faster memory upgrades into an old MacBook. You might be able to add more memory to your Macbook depending on your specific Apple Macbook you&#8217;re in the market to upgrade, but no &#8211; you cannot add faster ram. Adding more RAM, yes you can &#8211; assuming you have not maxed out the MacBook RAM already on your Apple MacBook.

[<img title="Cheapest Apple iMac" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-22-at-4.10.30-PM1.png" alt="Best Price Apple iMac" width="288" height="286" />][1]

**[Cheapest Desktop Mac][1]**

MacBook Memory comes in two flavors currently: DDR2 PC5300 sdram sodimms, and DDR3 SDRAM sodimms running at 1066MHz, which if you notice, is twice as fast as the older macbook ram. For the older macbook models, the maximum memory you can apply again depends on both who you talk to and what exact older macbook you have. Some memory stores like [OWC][2], will state that on the MacBook models where 2GB is the maximum RAM you can squeek another 1GB of RAM into the old MacBook by installing a 1GB memory upgrade for MacBook in the first slot and a 2GB memory upgrade module in the second slot. It&#8217;s always to suggest what Apple suggests, and leave the overclocking and other performance tweaks to others. If you are insterested in squeezing every last drop of performance out of your Apple computer [accelerate your mac][3] is a great resource about speeding up your MacBook

The same goes for the slightly newer MacBooks that maxed out at 4GB PC5300 DDR2 sdram sodimms : word on the street is you could effectively install 6GB of RAM into these older MacBooks, and it&#8217;s been reported to work just fine, but I can&#8217;t recommend doing this, if Apple states that 4GB is the maximum MacBook RAM, then that&#8217;s what I state and list as the MacBook maximum ram limit.

By theory, you should be OK with more RAM than officially stated, due in part that when the older MacBooks were released, the larger memory sizes were not released yet so the maximum memory stated was in part due to the biggest RAM upgrade available for MacBook at the time. But still, I list what Apple states as the maximum memory allowable.

<br>

		<div class="post-content">I&#8217;m not really looking to start a Mac vs PC discussion with this post, but I was asked this today and of course I am completely biased, as I grew up with the Mac so I just learned to be a died in the wool Apple Mac user and fan. I&#8217;d pick the iMac, without a doubt.

But there&#8217;s lots of you out there that would disagree and one of the benefits over the Apple iMac when shopping for an all in one HP is that the HP computers sure are cheaper. The title of this article states HP desktop but to be fair I think a HP branded all in one computer needs to be compared to Apple&#8217;s all in one computer: the Apple iMac.

**[Best Price on Apple iMac][1]**

On the HP website, the cheapest HP branded (there&#8217;s a cheaper compaq computer but it&#8217;s not an HP) all in one PC is currently the HP Omni 100z series Standard features included Windows 7 premium 64 bit. AMD Athlon II processor running at 2.0GHz, 2GB of DDR3 1066 SDRAM, 500GB hard drive, 20 inch LCD display and a wireless card which should come as standard equipment on anything. Heck, my phone and many other cellular phones can use wi-fi. This HP computer sells for $449.00

&nbsp;

On the Apple site, the [cheapest Apple iMac][2] you can buy is $1199.00 which even without digging deeper on the Apple iMac&#8217;s specifications you can tell that the iMac cost significantly more than the all in one offering from HP. You could buy close to three HP computers for the same price as the low end iMac.

The Apple iMac does ship with a bigger LCD display and comes with a faster processor running a 3.06 GHz using dual core i3 processors. The iMac also ships standard with twice as much RAM as the low priced HP computer and also includes wi-fi.

The Apple is also more compatible with most other Apple products, as it&#8217;s all in the family but the HP can connect to Apple iPods and the like too.

So the decision on what is the best might come down to budget. At just over $400, the HP computer sure is a bargain for an all in one computer. The iMac on the other hand has a bigger screen, faster processor and we won&#8217;t even get into comparing Apple vs Windows operating systems.

So. On a Budget? HP wins for a cheap all in one. If you want a Mac be prepared to spend considerably more but you get more speed in the form of ram and processor. The choice, ultimately is yours to make on whether you [**buy a HP desktop<**][3] or an [**Apple desktop computer**][3].
