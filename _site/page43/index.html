<p>The <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com">best prices on RAM</a>. If there is a theme here at ramseeker it is that it’s my goal to help you get the best deal on RAM that you can. Yes, memory has dropped in price in recent times but it still costs money to upgrade your desktop or notebook computer, and in most cases it is your hard earned money you’re spending on RAM so of course you want to find the cheapest RAM price you can find when it comes to ram upgrades for either your notebook or desktop computer, and I can help.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1146" title="Best Selling Apple RAM" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-24-at-1.55.27-PM.png" alt="Best Apple RAM Price" width="308" height="237" /></a></p>

<p>What you need when it comes to shopping for memory upgrades is the right upgrade at the best price. That’s it. It’s nice to shop for name brand memory but it’s not needed unless you’re doing mission critical work with your computer, but for the most of us we’re just surfing the internet, or some other task such as <a href="http://www.facebook.com">facebook</a> and using generic memory upgrades when shopping for RAM.</p>

<p>Why you want to look out for generic RAM as opposed to name brand memory is that for the most part – save for the little sticker on the ram module, there’s not a whole lot of difference between the two, except the price and it’s always been my policy to list the lowest price available for memory upgrades from the various memory manufacturers or resellers regardless of whether the memory is name brand or generic. If there’s an option, I have always tracked memory prices for generic ram as in most cases, generic memory is cheaper.</p>

<p>**Where to Buy Memory for the Best Price<br />
**<br />
Rather than list the lowest ram prices here I will direct you to a page that lists <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/where-to-buy-computer-memory-upgrades/">memory stores</a> you can <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com">buy ram </a>from and you can make the choice yourself, or you can search for the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/#lowest">cheapest apple memory</a> or <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/pc/index.php#lowest">cheapest PC memory</a> too.</p>

<div style="float: right; margin-right: 5px;">
</div>

<p>The short answer is: <strong>NO</strong></p>

<p>You cannot put faster memory upgrades into an old MacBook. You might be able to add more memory to your Macbook depending on your specific Apple Macbook you’re in the market to upgrade, but no – you cannot add faster ram. Adding more RAM, yes you can – assuming you have not maxed out the MacBook RAM already on your Apple MacBook.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8IO6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8IO6"><img title="Cheapest Apple iMac" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-22-at-4.10.30-PM1.png" alt="Best Price Apple iMac" width="288" height="286" /></a></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8IO6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8IO6">Cheapest Desktop Mac</a></strong></p>

<p>MacBook Memory comes in two flavors currently: DDR2 PC5300 sdram sodimms, and DDR3 SDRAM sodimms running at 1066MHz, which if you notice, is twice as fast as the older macbook ram. For the older macbook models, the maximum memory you can apply again depends on both who you talk to and what exact older macbook you have. Some memory stores like <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/OWC">OWC</a>, will state that on the MacBook models where 2GB is the maximum RAM you can squeek another 1GB of RAM into the old MacBook by installing a 1GB memory upgrade for MacBook in the first slot and a 2GB memory upgrade module in the second slot. It’s always to suggest what Apple suggests, and leave the overclocking and other performance tweaks to others. If you are insterested in squeezing every last drop of performance out of your Apple computer <a href="http://www.xlr8yourmac.com">accelerate your mac</a> is a great resource about speeding up your MacBook</p>

<p>The same goes for the slightly newer MacBooks that maxed out at 4GB PC5300 DDR2 sdram sodimms : word on the street is you could effectively install 6GB of RAM into these older MacBooks, and it’s been reported to work just fine, but I can’t recommend doing this, if Apple states that 4GB is the maximum MacBook RAM, then that’s what I state and list as the MacBook maximum ram limit.</p>

<p>By theory, you should be OK with more RAM than officially stated, due in part that when the older MacBooks were released, the larger memory sizes were not released yet so the maximum memory stated was in part due to the biggest RAM upgrade available for MacBook at the time. But still, I list what Apple states as the maximum memory allowable.</p>

Below is a little chart with the lowest ram prices for both older discontinued MacBooks and new and current shipping MacBooks too:</p>

    <h1><a href="/2011/01/which-is-best-hp-desktop-or-apple-imac/">Which is Best? HP Desktop or Apple iMac?</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>I’m not really looking to start a Mac vs PC discussion with this post, but I was asked this today and of course I am completely biased, as I grew up with the Mac so I just learned to be a died in the wool Apple Mac user and fan. I’d pick the iMac, without a doubt.</p>

<div style="float: right; margin-right: 5px;">
</div>

<p>But there’s lots of you out there that would disagree and one of the benefits over the Apple iMac when shopping for an all in one HP is that the HP computers sure are cheaper. The title of this article states HP desktop but to be fair I think a HP branded all in one computer needs to be compared to Apple’s all in one computer: the Apple iMac.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8IO6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8IO6">Best Price on Apple iMac</a></strong></p>

<p>On the HP website, the cheapest HP branded (there’s a cheaper compaq computer but it’s not an HP) all in one PC is currently the HP Omni 100z series Standard features included Windows 7 premium 64 bit. AMD Athlon II processor running at 2.0GHz, 2GB of DDR3 1066 SDRAM, 500GB hard drive, 20 inch LCD display and a wireless card which should come as standard equipment on anything. Heck, my phone and many other cellular phones can use wi-fi. This HP computer sells for $449.00</p>

<p> </p>

<p>On the Apple site, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;field-keywords=imac&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;linkId=2M6BG7UFW75WM6QM">cheapest Apple iMac</a> you can buy is $1199.00 which even without digging deeper on the Apple iMac’s specifications you can tell that the iMac cost significantly more than the all in one offering from HP. You could buy close to three HP computers for the same price as the low end iMac.</p>

<p>The Apple iMac does ship with a bigger LCD display and comes with a faster processor running a 3.06 GHz using dual core i3 processors. The iMac also ships standard with twice as much RAM as the low priced HP computer and also includes wi-fi.</p>

<p>The Apple is also more compatible with most other Apple products, as it’s all in the family but the HP can connect to Apple iPods and the like too.</p>

<p>So the decision on what is the best might come down to budget. At just over $400, the HP computer sure is a bargain for an all in one computer. The iMac on the other hand has a bigger screen, faster processor and we won’t even get into comparing Apple vs Windows operating systems.</p>

<p>So. On a Budget? HP wins for a cheap all in one. If you want a Mac be prepared to spend considerably more but you get more speed in the form of ram and processor. The choice, ultimately is yours to make on whether you <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26x%3D0%26ref_%3Dnb_sb_noss%26y%3D0%26field-keywords%3Dhp%2520desktop%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957"><strong>buy a HP desktop&lt;</strong></a> or an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26x%3D0%26ref_%3Dnb_sb_noss%26y%3D0%26field-keywords%3Dhp%2520desktop%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957"><strong>Apple desktop computer</strong></a>.</p>

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>Most, when looking for memory upgrades for their computers tend to associate the best computer ram with the cheapest computer RAM and the two don’t mean the same thing in most cases. You can buy cheap RAM from a long list of <a href="http://www.memoryseller.com">memory sellers</a>. Heck, in an afternoon I could set up a ram memory store and sell you memory, but retail is not one of my strong points so I’ll stick to helping you get the best deal on RAM and let the others specialize in selling RAM.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW">Best Selling Apple Computer RAM</a> </strong>The <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/AMZ_MacBookPro">best place to buy RAM, or computer</a> <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com">memory</a>, or random access memory, as it is known to be called or RAM for short is from an honest <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">computer memory store</a> that offers you a good fair price on memory upgrades and offers you the option to return or exchange your memory upgrad in the slight chance that you might have a problem with your laptop upgrade.</p>

<p>So, where to Buy RAM? I compare and monitor memory prices from a select few memory stores who meet my qualification as to what a good memory store should be, and that’s they should offer a fair price on RAM upgrades for either your Mac or PC computer. I tend to lean towards the Apple computer and am more familiar with Apple Memory such as iMac Memory or MacBook memory, but this is the year I change this and my goal is to help you get the best deal possible on RAM regardless of whether you are a Mac OS or Windows user.</p>

<p>Another resource for buying RAM and where to buy Memory is the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/where-to-buy-computer-memory-upgrades/">list of memory stores</a> I have created to help you determine where you want to buy RAM from. RAM prices change, (lately, they’ve been dropping) so you should take some time to get the best deal on ram upgrades because I have found in the years I have been tracking memory that different memory shops have different ideas on the what the definition of lowest price ram means.</p>

<p>If you’ve been a visitor to ramseeker in the past, it should come as no surprise that I <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com">specialize in Apple memory</a> moreso than the PC brands, in part due to the fact that a: I’m drinking the Apple Koolaid and am a true blue Apple fan but also the model numbers and names for most PC desktops and notebooks are quite many, compared to the Apple computers which essentially come in both portable and desktop solutions for consumer and business totaling up the entire Apple computer lineup in just 4 models.</p>

<p>But in 2011, the goal is to change this and widen my scope to include not only <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/pc">HP Memory Prices</a> but Dell, Sony an other computer manufacturers so today I thought it would be a good idea to familiarize myself with the current HP linuep and for today, we’ll start with notebooks, as they tend to be the more popular computer type over desktop models.</p>

<p>The HP notebook lineup in 2011 is currently broken down to 5 different notebook computer types:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004FYYGD4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004FYYGD4"><img title="Best Priced HP Notebook" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-6.59.41-AM.png" alt="Best Deal on HP Notebooks" width="305" height="270" /></a></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004FYYGD4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004FYYGD4">Best Priced HP Notebook</a></strong></p>

<p>**HP Mini Netbooks<br />
HP Everyday Notebooks<br />
HP Ultra Portable Notebooks<br />
HP High Performance Notebooks<br />
HP Envy Notebooks<br />
**</p>

<p>Each and every one of these notebooks can benefit from a computer memory upgrade, and in later articles I want to explore each notebook model from HP seperately and help you find the best deal on a memory upgrade for your HP notebook, but for today what I can do is suggest a few ways to upgrade HP memory and where to get the best price on memory for HP too.</p>

<p>You have three options when it comes to memory upgrades for HP notebooks and desktops. You can buy ram from HP (and boy, will you pay) or you can buy ram from a name brand manufacturer such as <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">Crucial</a>. You’ll still pay more than the cheapest option when it comes to HP RAM upgrades, which is to buy generic RAM, but with the name brand ram you will get the perceived value of buying ram from a reputable name brand memory manufacturer.</p>

<p>My favorite way to save money on HP memory upgrades is to buy generic ram from a trusted third party you can trust. I’ve got a quick list of memory stores in the sidebar that will be happy to not only sell you ram for HP for up to half price, but also offer top notch support if the rare chance you have a problem with your HP RAM.</p>

<p>Generic Memory Upgrades for HP or any other PC manufacturer are my favorite way to save money due to the fact that this ram type is not only half the price you’d pay for name brand memory but the memory is still manufactured to the same exact standards required by HP but without the cost associated with the more expensive and popular name brand memory.</p>

<p>Lastly, if the list of memory stores I list on this page is not enough, you can always <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/where-to-buy-computer-memory-upgrades/">buy HP RAM</a> from a much bigger list of only memory stores that will gladly help get you the best price on your next <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">HP Memory Upgrade</a>.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2011/01/best-place-to-buy-apple-memory/">Best Place to Buy Apple Memory</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>Over the past dozen or so years I have been tracking <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com">Apple memory prices</a>, I have found I’m reluctant to recommend one specific memory store as I have no place to suggest the <strong>best value when it comes to ram upgrades</strong> as value is a subjective thing and for you, the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">best place to buy Apple Memory</a> might be Best Buy or some other electronics retailer in the USA as it’s local and convenient.MacBook Pro RAM is one of the most popular Apple Memory you can buy today:</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW">Best Selling Apple Memory</a></strong></p>

<p>If you’re <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/Apple">buying a a new Apple computer</a>, then the best bet might be just to order your Apple Mac full of ram direct from the factory. This is in most cases, the most expensive memory you can buy but you gain in convenience and can use Apple’s one click ordering system to buy the Mac and RAM at the same time. You don’t need to worry about memory installation instructions or anti-static wrist bands and and the trouble of buying a Mac and then having to worry about where you are going to buy RAM from.</p>

<p>But for most, “best place” translates to “cheapest place” when it comes to RAM as there’s a good chance you are looking for a deal on RAM as opposed to paying full price. But you still need to consider the chance of bad ram, as it is super-rare but does happen and if it happens to you you know you want to buy Apple Memory or memory for any PC from a memory store that offers support if you do run into a problem with your apple RAM upgrade.</p>

<p>So I’ll leave it to you to decide where or whom exactly to buy ram from, but I can make a few suggestions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Compare Apple RAM prices. If price is the dominant factor when it comes to memory upgrades, then I have done the legwork for you and list current apple memory prices for all Apple computers where you can easily find the price you want for RAM.&lt;/p&gt;</li>
  <li>
    <p>If you’re just looking for ram stores to buy from, check out my list of <strong>best memory stores</strong> in the sidebar of this article. Every one of these memory sellers have been in business for over ten plus years and have helped thousands get the right ram for your Mac every time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>If number 2 isn’t enough choice I offer a much <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/where-to-buy-computer-memory-upgrades/">bigger list of memory stores to buy Apple RAM</a></strong></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Apple Memory is cheap</strong>, and you really can’t go wrong with any of the memory stores I have recommended above. If you need further help with your memory upgrades for Apple or any computer, feel free to contact me. I’m happy to help.</p>

Besides, I’m an Apple Fan from way back. But RAM is RAM and the same benefit you get from **upgrading your Apple computer **to the most memory possible also applies to PC notebooks too: If you <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memoryx">add more memory to your laptop </a>it will run smoother and faster and with more applications avialable than before.</p>

<p>The <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="best memory upgrades for macbook pro 13 inch">best memory upgrades for 13 inch Apple MacBook Pro </a></strong>is up to you.

<p>I can also <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/where-to-buy-computer-memory-upgrades/">recommend just a few memory stores</a> where you can <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">buy ram</a> for MacBook Pro and get a great deal on MBP RAM.  You will get a much better deal buying ram from any one of the memory stores I list and track prices for  than if you were to upgrade the memory from <a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple</a>. Apple RAM is just fine, but you will pay for the pleasure  of buying ram for your MacBook Pro directly from Apple. It’s quite possible to pay close to twice as much than if you were to buy ram from a respectable and trusted third party memory store.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26x%3D0%26ref_%3Dnb_sb_noss%26y%3D0%26field-keywords%3Dmacbook%2520pro%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">latest MacBook Pro 13 inch models</a> accept up to 8GB of RAM and I suggest  you complete this upgrade as the 8GB RAM for MacBook Pros have dropped in price considerably –  I see now for the first time you can buy MacBook Pro RAM  for under $100 from some memory upgrade stores. Not too long ago the same memory would cost you close to $1000 for 8GB of MacBook Pro RAM.</p>

<p>This advice applies to  all Apple MacBook Pro models currently shipping, not just the 13 inch model as though the case and screen size might be smaller on the 13inch MacBook Pro, the memory  requirements are exactly the same for the 15 inch and 17 inch MacBook Pro’s too.</p>

<p>What you want to consider when buying the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">best MacBook Pro RAM</a> is price, sure   – but also warranty in the rare occassion you do get stuck with a bad ram chip you want the piece of mind that comes with a lifetime warranty when shopping for memory upgrades for any Mac, not just the laptop Mac computers.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2011/01/upgrading-mac-ram-2gb-to-4gb/">Upgrading Mac RAM: 2GB to 4GB</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p> </p>

<p>If there’s a sweet spot when it comes to memory upgrades, it is upgrading your memory from 2GB to 4Gb when it comes to <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="mac memory upgrades">Mac Memory Upgrades</a>.MacBook Models from Apple are just one of many notebook computers to take advantage of a 4GB Memory Upgrade from 2GB.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001KUL012/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001KUL012">Best 4GB RAM Memory</a></strong></p>

<p>At 2gb of RAM, what once was considered a very capable amount of memory, in 2011 this amount of memory is at very least standard with your Mac or should  be. When running a current operating system such as I am here as I write this article in wordpress, and with just a few other applications open such as Mail, iTunes, Safari and iPhoto, I am currently using 3GB of the 4GB of RAM (and in my case, this is the maximum RAM for my MacBook Pro. Only 25% of the memory I have installed is free when running Mac OS X, version 10.6.6 and a few Apple Applications running and with open windows.</p>

<p>So, as you can see 2gB of RAM is nice, but 4GB of RAM is better. For some,8GB of memory and higher will be out of reach due to either limitations of the Mac’s maximum memory allowed or even just their pocketbook – 8GB of memory and higher could be too much ram.</p>

<p>But with 4GB of RAM installed you have at very minimum enough RAM to run a current Mac operating system and still have enough memory to have a few Apple applications running and a few windows open. If you don’t have enough RAM and the  2GB you have installed is not  enough ram to run the computing tasks you need, the OS uses the hard disk for temporary memory storage. This is becoming less of an issue thanks due to the popularity of SSD hard drives and as these newer flash based hard drives gain in popularity they will also drop in price too.</p>

<p>But there’s no such thing as having too much RAM and for most computing tasks that are common in everyday use, 4gb of RAM is a good balance of enough ram for those on a budget when considering RAM upgrades.</p>

<p>Below you will find the latest and current ram prices for 4gb RAM for all currently shipping Apple Computer models:</p>

<p>Four memory upgrade slots are available for uprading the 2010 iMacs in either 4GB, 8GB or 16GB memory configurations, depending on your computing budget, as the Apple iMac is a consumer desktop and we all have other costs besides memory upgrades to worry about.</p>

<p>But iMac RAM is cheap, compared to the benefits and length of time you will use and enjoy your Apple iMac you really should, if your budget allows upgrade your iMac with the most memory you can afford. When you do the math, your iMac RAM upgrade could be had for pennies a day.</p>

<p>**Where to Buy 1333Mhz iMac Memory Upgrades<br />
**</p>

<p>I have been tracking and monitoring ram prices for so long, I can recommend some memory stores to safely and securely buy your Apple iMac RAM upgrades from. A few names include <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memoryx">MemoryX</a>, <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/1800">18004Memory</a> and <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">Crucial Technology</a> to name just a few memory stores I know and trust.</p>

<p>When it comes to iMac RAM Prices, the prices change on memory upgrades so your best bet is to check the iMac Memory Price charts and tables I have for Apple iMac 2010 memory to get both the latest ram prices but also the best ram prices from a reputable memory seller.</p>
