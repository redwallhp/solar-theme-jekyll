<p>The Apple iMac 21.5 inch 2.5Ghz model released  in May 2011 is the **<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004YKXGIK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B004YKXGIK">cheapest Apple iMac</a> **you can buy in 2011.</p>

<p>Offering a fast 2.5GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i5 processor with 6MB  of on chip shared L3 cache, a gorgeous 1920×1080 LCD display, 4GB of memory as the factory default Apple iMac memory configuration, 500MB of hard drive space and AMD Radeon HD6750 video card –  the newest and least expensive iMac aimed at the consumer or  home office or student  user offers a fantastic computing value and ease of use other PC manufacturers  have tried but failed to duplicate but with  fail.</p>

<p><img class="size-full wp-image-2265 alignnone" title="Apple iMac Deal" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Screen-shot-2011-06-20-at-4.51.17-PM.png" alt="Best iMac Price" width="490" height="397" /></p>

<p><strong>Video</strong></p>

<p>New on the 2011 Apple iMac 21.5 inch 2.5Ghz  when compared to later or earlier iMacs is the Facetime HD  web camera and the ability to support an external monitor up to 30 inches and yet still use the iMac display as well, totaling over 50 inches of screen real estate, a perfect match for video editing or working with photography where big screens are needed for at a glance menu and toolbar selection.</p>

<p><strong>Sound</strong></p>

<p>When using Apple iTunes or any other compatible video or MP3 player (iTunes ships free with all iMac models) the sound is provided through stereo  17 watt loudspeakers and multiple ports are also inlcluded for both analog and digital audio requirements.</p>

<p>**Connections **</p>

<p>The Apple iMac offers very versatile  connection options  with all connectors placed on the rear of  the 21.5 inch iMac to compliment the clean Apple iMac design and getting unsightly cables hidden out of plain sight. One thunderbolt connector (there’s 2 thunderbolt connector on every other 2011 Apple iMac so you may want to consider a more expensive iMac if  the thunderbolt  technology is now, or will be important to your computing needs).</p>

<p>The mini display port offers connection options for both VGA and DVI options,  but as the connectors are specific to Apple computers, the iMac accessories can be considered expensive when compared to more standard VGA connections on your standard desktop PC’s.</p>

<p>One firwire 800 port is included on the iMac, but  over time you will find that as the Thunderbolt technolgy improves that it’s my guess firewire will not be included on future Apple iMac  models.</p>

<p><strong>Wireless Keyboard and Mouse</strong></p>

<p>One  of the nicest features on the new 2011 Apple iMacs is the fact that using the included bluetooth technology you’re now free of wires when using the the cheap iMac and this fact makes the  cheap iMac a much more attractive solution for home computing as some kitchens now include a little nook or small desk for a TV or computer and the iMac would make a very attractive wire-free computer for home use.</p>

<p><strong>Size and Weight</strong></p>

<p>Height: 17.75 inches (45.1 cm)<br />
Width: 20.8 inches (52.8 cm)<br />
Depth: 7.42 inches (18.85 cm)<br />
Weight: 20.5 pounds (9.3 kg)3</p>

<p>At 20lbs, the Apple iMac 21.5 inch is not light and in no way match a ultra portable computer such as the MacBook Air, but thanks to it’s sleek design with cable free technology you could move it simply and easily if you needed periodically move the Apple iMac.</p>

<p><strong>Warranty</strong><br />
This iMac model, like all Apple computers, comes standard with 90 days of telephone support to get you up and running with your new iMac and a one year limited warranty is included with the Apple iMac too. There is an extended warranty you can buy for the iMac, but as the iMac is not a portable in any sense of the word, I don’t think an extended warranty is really needed for this affordable Apple desktop. At just over $1000 for the computer itself, it makes no sense to add another cost to the AppleCare warranty which even on sale costs over $100, and unless you use the iMac in some extremely dirty or dusty environments I feel it’s better to save the $150 and apply it to more memory upgrades.</p>

<p>**Apple iMac 21.5 inch 2.5GHz Memory Upgrades<br />
**</p>

<p>The Apple iMac 21.5 inch 2.5Ghz model is the only model in the 2011 Apple lineup that only allows for a 8GB RAM maximum and all other faster iMacs (and more expensive too) wil accept 16GB of iMac DDR3 1333Mhz RAM. The good news is if you’re upgrading from the 2010 Apple iMac lineup, you can use and swap out the RAM from your old iMac to new.</p>

<p>If you’re buying an iMac 21.5 inch 2.5GHz, you need to add more iMac RAM to the cheapest iMac in Apple’s iMac lineup. From the factory, this sleek consumer Mac ships with 4GB of RAM (2x2GB sdram dimms), but you should double the RAM to 8GB for maximum performance. Not too long ago, 8GB of iMac RAM would cost you as much as the computer itself, but ove time iMac RAM prices have really dropped and you now can fill this affordable iMac with all the RAM it can handle for the cost of a dinner and a movie.</p>

<p>You could do just fine with running 4GB of iMac RAM, and for some of you 4GB might be all the RAM you need, but as we enter the second half of the year, 8GB of RAM is so cheap for this computer it really is very good money spent on your computer, and in some instances better than adding more hard drive space to your iMac (you should have an external hard drive for backup) or even buying software as a lot of software you can get for free or work ‘in the cloud’ where you don’t really need an application on your iMac above and beyond what’s included with the iMac at the store, such as iTunes and iPhoto, programs that allow you to organize your photos and music on your iMac.</p>

<p>The Apple iMac, and especially this model is one of the <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004YKXGIK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B004YKXGIK">best iMac bargains</a>,</strong> if not one of the most well designed and stylish desktop computers available today.

<p><strong>June 2012 Update:</strong> This year in 2012 Apple offers a <strong>pretty good deal for back to school purchases</strong> from the <a href="http://store.apple.com/us/browse/campaigns/back_to_school">Apple Store</a>.</p>

<p>When you purchase a Mac between June 11, 2012 and September 21, 2012  you’ll also get a $100 back to school gift card for use for Apps, Books, Movies or Music.</p>

<p>When you purchase an iPad between June 11, 2012 and September 21, 2012 you’re eligible for a $50 Back To School Gift Card</p>

<p>This back to school gift card offer is in addition to any Apple Education discounts you may be eligible for. Faculty and staff members from any grade level are also available for a discount.</p>

<p><strong>Apple Education Discount Qualifications</strong></p>

<p>To be eligible for an education discount from Apple you need to be a college student, a student accepted to a college or a parent buying a Mac or an iPad on behalf of a student for the upcoming year.</p>

<p>2012 Apple Education Discounts</p>

<p>Save up  to $200 of a MacBook Pro</p>

<p>Save up to $50 off a MacBook Air</p>

<p>Save up to $100 off an iMac</p>

<p>Interestingly, there is no discount for buying an iPad, but you still are entitled to the discount.</p>

<p>Overall, these are pretty good discounts and if you include the gift cards in the back to school promotions  from Apple this year you could save up to $200 and get a 100 dollar gift card – that’s a discount of  $300 when compared to buying  your Mac at tull price from the Apple Store.</p>

<hr />

<p>The <a href="http://store.apple.com/us/browse/campaigns/back_to_school?aid=www-naus-bts2011-0526-14" title="summer back to school apple deal">summer deal on Apple Mac Computers for Students</a>, in my opinion this year isn’t half as good or enticing as it has been in previous years where you could <strong>buy a Mac and get a free iPod</strong> which would make for a more logical deal than this year’s offering that sees Apple promoting their App Store more than their iPod lineup.</p>

<p>The good news with this is that on <a href="http://store.apple.com/us/browse/campaigns/back_to_school?aid=www-naus-bts2011-0526-14">select Macs you can save up to $200</a> with educational prices being offered <strong>AND you get $100 worth of software to start the school year off with</strong> from Apple’s relatively new App Store, which might be a better deal for your pocketbook in the long term than in past years where you got an iPod for free.</p>

<p>MacBooks are available <strong>starting at $899</strong>, <strong>MacBook Pro’s at $1099</strong>, <strong>MacBook Airs at  $949 **and **iMacs at $1149</strong> which works out to the following discounts before you add the $100 App Store credit:</p>

<p><strong>MacBook : $100 savings</strong></p>

<p><strong>MacBook Pro: up to $200 savings</strong></p>

<p>**MacBook Air: save $50 **</p>

<p>**iMac: Save $100 **</p>

<p>One interesting  thing I noted with this deal is that the <strong>Mac Mini, Apple’s cheapest Mac</strong> isn’t listed, but I find  odd, considering students don’t have a lot of money to buy Apple computers  I thought that this would be one of the first choices for students entering college, as it ‘s currently  the cheapest Apple computer you can buy. Also, the only desktop available is the iMac. You don’t get educational pricing with this deal on the Mac Pro it seems.</p>

<p>RAM for all these computers cost a lot more money at Apple (<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/macbook-pro-ddr3-1333mhz-memory-upgrade-prices/">see MacBook Pro RAM Prices for example</a>) and you’re much better off if you <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="buy ram">buy RAM</a> for much less with all the money you saved, and in the case of the MacBook Pro, you could <a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT2KIT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1339"><strong>fill the notebook with much cheaper RAM</strong>,</a> and <strong>still have $100 in your pocket plus the App Store credit</strong> too if you <strong>buy RAM for the MacBook Pros</strong> that works just as well and is at the time I write this – over $300 cheaper than the memory  from the Apple Store. You might not get a <strong>free iPod</strong> as you may have in recent years, but you still could end up with what essentially could be a <strong>free RAM Upgrade</strong> for your back to school notebook computer, $100 in your pocket, and a $100 credit from the App Store too.</p>

</p>

<p>The** <a href="http://www.kqzyfj.com/click-1548159-10715248">Dell Inspiron 17R 2nd Generation starts at just $599 when you buy direct from Dell,</a>** and yet for  some reason it’s priced much  higher at Amazon where you can still buy a Dell 17inch Inspiron but it will cost you either $200 or $100 more</p>

<p><strong>Best RAM for Dell Inspiron</strong></p>

<p><strong>Inspiron 17R 2nd Gen Review</strong><br />
The <strong>second generation of Dells</strong> use either <strong>intel i3, Intel i5, or Intel i7 processors</strong> and depending on what processor you chose when configuring your big screen notebook, the cost may be higher than the  <strong>$599 price advertised **when you buy from Dell directly as this model features **second generation i3 processors</strong> which aren’t the fastest processor intel makes but is perfect for light computing duty such as email or web browsing. But if you’re working with a <strong>17 inch notebook</strong> there’s a good chance you you’ll be working with audio, video or other processor heavy tasks that require more speed and more importantly, <strong>more RAM</strong>.<img class="size-full wp-image-2234 alignnone" title="Cheapest Dell Inspiron 17R" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Screen-shot-2011-06-16-at-1.41.15-PM.png" alt="Deal on Dell Inspiron 17R " width="575" height="476" /></p>

<p>Out of the box, the <strong>cheapest 17 inch Dell notebook</strong> uses <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/best-prices-for-notebook-memory-ddr3-1333mhz-204-pin-sodimms/" title="Best Prices for Notebook Memory: DDR3 1333Mhz 204 Pin SODIMMS">DDR3 1333Mhz SDRAM</a> sodimms that out of the box ships with <strong>4GB of memory uprades already installed,</strong> which in mid-2011 is a useable amount  of RAM and for some who’s main computing task is <a href="http://www.facebook.com">facebook</a> the <strong>4GB DDR3</strong> just might do you fine without any need to buy Dell memory upgrades for this 17 inch notebook aimed at the home and  home office market</p>

<p>But as I mentioned when I wrote about the smaller version of this dell inspiron model – the <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/dell-inspiron-15r-2nd-generation-laptop-memory-upgrades/" title="best dell 15 inch notebook">Dell Inspiron 15R 2nd generation</a></strong> notebook, and especially if you’ve got the big screen Dell, you’re either gaming or doing serious work on this Dell computer and **you’re going to need as much RAM as possible **to max out the Dell Inspiron 17R with RAM upgrades for a computer that could see a 50% speed increase all by adding $100 (<a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT2KIT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1339">much less actually</a>) of RAM.</p>

<p>To <strong>max out the RAM on the Dell Inspiron 17R **you need to remove the factory RAM (which you can sell online for  even more savings on memory. Try craigslist or eBay for selling you  factory installed Dell memory upgrades) and install bigger ram modules. Depending on your ram configuration, you could see either **2x2GB memory upgrades in your Dell</strong>, or in some cases 1x2GB and 1x4GB ram upgrades. If you bought a Dell Inspiron 17R second generation you can stop reading now as you now have the fastest Dell notebook (or at least all the RAM the Dell can handle). For the rest of you, keep reading:</p>

<p><strong>Dell Inspiron 17R 2nd generation memory  upgrade installation</strong></p>

<p>Upgrading the ram on this <strong>big screen beauty from Dell</strong> couldn’t be easier. Flip  the notebook over, remove the battery and be sure you’re <strong>free of any static electricity</strong> as static is a RAM killer. You’re dealing with a <strong>very expensive piece of electronics here</strong>, and  <strong>installing Dell memory is easy</strong> but you do need to be sure you’re installing  RAM so you don’t fry your Dell or void the warranty. If you have any apprehension about <strong>installing the memory yourself</strong> you should take your Dell and your RAM to an authorized service center for Dell. Best Buy might be one place you can take your Dell for ram installation services.</p>

<p>But you really shouldn’t have to take the Dell anywhere to get RAM installed. With the battery out, and you static free, you remove the bottom plastic cover that hides the ram upgrade slots, which are easily accessible and within reach for  any easy RAM upgrade, and assuming you already have the new RAM in hand should only take you five minutes. On each end of the ram module are little plastic clips that when you pull them apart and away from RAM upgrade, allows the memory module to pop up in the memory slot at a 45 degree angle, which allows you to remove the factory RAM from the ram upgrade slot on the Dell Inspiron 17R.  Then you just repeat for the second memory module.</p>

<p>Once you have the RAM out of the Dell Inspiron 17r you can <strong>install the new RAM you bought</strong>, which is <strong><a href="http://www.dpbolvw.net/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT51264BC1339">4GB DDR3 SDRAM SODIMMS</a></strong>. This RAM upgrade is  sold in <strong><a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT2KIT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1339">8GB DDR3 memory upgrade Kits </a></strong>which is easier to buy than individual ram upgrades and you usually get a <strong>small discount on the memory upgrade kits</strong> instead  of <strong>buying the RAM upgrades individually</strong>. The new RAM has a slot on it so you really can’t mess up the Dell memory upgrade installation, as long as you take caution with static electricity. Just seat the bigger RAM for Dell in the new ram sockets and when seated, the  RAM module should click into place using those two little tabs, screw the plastic cover back onto the bottom of your Dell Inspiron 17R 2nd Generation and replace the battery. Flip the Dell over, and  you’re done.</p>

<p>One thing  I should note is that any** RAM install should be done on a clean, dry and preferably soft surface** (a towel works great  so you don’t scratch the laptop  lid).</p>

<p><strong>Best Prices and Deals for Dell Inspiron 17R 2nd Generation Notebook Computers</strong></p>

<p>This is the one time where I suggest you <strong><a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10639500">buy this model of Dell notebook directly from Dell</a></strong>, as opposed to say, Amazon which does have <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26x%3D0%26ref_%3Dnb_sb_noss%26y%3D0%26field-keywords%3D17%2520inch%2520laptop%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps%23&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">deals and best prices on other 17 inch notebooks</a></strong> but if you’re in the market for this particular  Dell model, your best bet is probably  to <strong>buy  the Dell Directly</strong>. As I write this, Dell has a <strong><a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10639500">12 day summer sale going on</a></strong> which might get you an even better price on an everyday 17 inch notebook from Dell if you’re lucky.</p>

<p>The <strong><a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10639500">2nd generation of Dell Notebooks</a></strong> with a 15 inch LCD display offer two features over the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/dell-inspiron-15r-n5010-memory-upgrades/" title="dell inspiron N5010 RAM">Dell Inspiron 15R N5010</a> and that’s a <strong>faster processor inside this dell laptop</strong> as well as (something I could care less about, but I’m probably not the market for this dell notebook anyway) and that’s the fact that the lids or top cover of this 15 inch notebook from <strong>Dell offers switch lids</strong>, and if you’ve got thirty bucks or so you can swap out the colors of your dell to personalize it further and make it stand out from other Dells, but I’d rather spend the switch lids money on something that will get you computing faster with the 2nd generation Dell 15R notebook computer, and that’s <strong>adding more RAM</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Cheapest RAM Prices for Dell Inspiron 15R 2nd Generation</strong></p>

<p><img src="http://i.dell.com/das/dih.ashx/314x314/images/global/products/314x314/inspiron-15r-right-black-alternate-314.jpg" alt="Dell Inspiron 15R Laptop Computer" border="0" /></p>

<p>This is probably one of the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/what-is-the-best-computer-brand-to-buy/" title="What is the Best Computer Brand to Buy?">best selling dell notebook computers</a> in 2011 thanks to the fact that it’s priced at under $500 at $499,  but I’d go and spend the additional $50 and buy the $549.00 Dell 15R as opposed to the older and slower model that doesn’t have as fast as a processor <strong>when comparing the two 15 inch Dell notebooks side by side</strong>.</p>

<p>At $549, the Dell packs a fair bit of notebook computer value and when you consider the fact a MacBook Pro 15 inch is $2000 or more –  a $500 notebook looks pretty good in 201.  The main features of the Dell Inspiron 15R  include the switch lids I mentioned above, but also is enabled for Widi and 3DTV that allows you to wirelessly project  your movies to your HDTV. You can buy the  Dell Inspiron 15R with 2nd generation Intel Core i7 processors, <strong>more RAM</strong>, bigger hard drives and add printers, monitors and other to your shopping cart, but at  $549 you’ll limited to an Intel Core i3 processor, <strong>4GB of DDR3 1333Mhz RAM</strong> which is actually a very usable RAM amount  and  for every day home use and web browsing like facebook, etc, it’s quite possible you won’t need to upgrade the RAM on the Dell Inspiron 15R.</p>

<p>But, I recommend two things: That you do buy more dell memory and you don’t buy  the RAM from Dell as it’s priced too much. 4GB DDR3 memory of which you’ll need two of to max out the RAM on a Dell 15R 2nd generation will set you back over $200 or more, where alternately you can <strong><a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT2KIT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1339">buy the maximum RAM of 8GB for well under $100</a></strong> and save closer to $200 on Dell memory uprades, all by taking 5 minutes to  shop around for the best prices on RAM Upgrades from memory vendors you can trust and are reputable, as that’s the only kind of RAM and  memory I recommend.</p>

<p>All this advice only applies to saving money on RAM upgrades on the Dell Inspiron 2nd generation 15R (which looks like a great deal on a windows 7 notebook) and if you’ve got deep pockets or don’t have the time to install the ram yourself (it’s easy to do a memory upgrade  on most any Dell computer – just pop the battery out, and there’s a cover on the bottom of the notebook you remove to acesss the two memory upgrade slots available) then you may  be better off just configuring the RAM when you buy the Inspiron online from Dell, but for those of us that want to save money on Dell Memory Upgrades, regardless s of specific model number.</p>

<p>To upgrade the RAM on Dell Inspiron 15R 2nd generation you’ll need to <strong><a href="http://www.dpbolvw.net/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT51264BC1339">buy two 4GB DDR3 1333mhz sodimms</a></strong>, usually sold in <strong><a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT2KIT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1339">8GB notebook memory upgrade kits</a></strong> that make it easy to upgrade the two slots available for upgrade on this affordable Dell designed for every day home and small office use.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2011/05/how-much-ram-do-i-need-for-a-laptop/">How Much RAM Do I Need For A Laptop?</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>The short answer to how much memory you need – regardless of computer manufacturer – Mac or PC, is you <strong>need as much memory as possible</strong></p>

<p>There’s a good chance that you need to upgrade the laptop you’re using to read this with, as out of the box and direct from the factory, unless you bought a CTO (configured to order) PC that you chose to fill your laptop with, there’s a good chance the RAM you have installed is just enough to RUN the operating systems and not much else.</p>

<p>Apple Mac OS Snow Leopards Minimum RAM Requirements are 1GB, and 5GB of hard drive space, yet that is JUST for the operating system to RUN, and not much else, including the iApps such as iTunes, iPhoto and the like. And if you need to run Aperture or any processor intensive application that uses memory then the minimum recommended ram of 1GB for MacOS</p>

<p>On the Windows side of things, you’ll need even more memory. 1GB will do you for running 32 bit Windows 7, but if you need 64 bit Microsoft Windows for your laptop OS then 2GB is the minimum RAM you should have installed</p>

<p>As you can see, 1GB or even 2GB really isn’t a whole lot of RAM if you want to do anything with your computer than start it up. (try installing windows 7 or even Mac OS on a 1GB laptop and you’ll see what I mean)</p>

<p>In 2011, the minimum RAM I would recommend for every day computing is 4GB. 8GB is better if your notebook computer can accomodate the larger memory size, but if you’re looking to buy and upgrade a notebook computer in 2011 you’re best to max out your laptop to 8GB if you can.</p>

<p>**Best RAM Prices for Laptops.<br />
**</p>

<p>There’s a very good chance your laptop takes DDR3 1333Mhz memory upgrades and below is a table of the best notebook prices I have found on sale from memory stores you can trust that are much much cheaper than if you bought the memory from the PC manufacturers directly.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">Not much at all. </a></p>

<p>You can double the RAM in your MBP to 4GB very easily and cheaply just by adding more memory. You’ll  need to buy new ram upgrades and replace the ram  in your MacBook Pro – currently 2x1GB MacBook Pro RAM  with larger 2×2 GB RAM for MacBook Pros but the cost is negligible, especially if you are making your living with your MacBook Pro adding another 2gb of RAM will be like breathing a breath of fresh air into now what will be a discontinued MacBook Pro, as the current MBP’s take 8GB of DDR3 SDRAM.</p>

<p>I don’t know what specific model of MacBook Pro you’re looking to ugprade, but you should  be able to do so for not  much money at all. MacBook Pro models that accept 4GB are now, in 2011 a few years old and you could be looking to squeeze more life out of a 2009, 2010 or even 2008 MacBook Pro notebook, as these all max out with 4GB of memory.</p>

<p>You’ll be in the market for DDR3 1066 SDRAM dimms and a s you can see by the MacBook Pro RAM Price chart below RAM for MacBooks is cheaper than it has ever been before and  continues to drop in price over time, so if you want, you can wait until ram prices fall even further. But the disadvantage of this approach is that your’e sacrificing your time over money when the benefit of the ram will far outweigh the costs of a 4GB RAM upgrade for a MacBook Pro.</p>

<p>The HP DV6 notebook computer lineup comes in many different models and configurations  and has been a popular notebook computer from HP for some time, but I want to concentrate today on the newest and latest HP DV6 series notebooks as these are one of the best selling HP notebooks available today and run either i3, i5, or i7 Intel Core processors and when it comes to ram for the 2011 HP DV6 notebook lineup your best deal and correct RAM to buy is DDR3 1066MHz sdram sodimms.</p>

<p>Out of the box, whether you buy a HP DV6 series notebook from Best Buy, or  Amazon or even from HP directly this notebook comes shipped from the factory various with standard memory configurations depending on processor speed and model number, but  the maximum RAM for the HP DV6 notebooks stays the same at 8GB and unless you buy your HP completely configured with the maximum ram already installed that while is probably the easiest way to upgrade ram on this HP notebook, it’s far from the cheapest and you’re much better off  buying HP DV6 memory from a trusted memory store that guarantees the RAM to work just fine in your HP notebook, but for far less money than what you could expect to spend  on a HP memory upgrade.</p>

<p>As you can see from above, the  prices above for HP DV6 ram and memory upgrades are quite reasonable with  an 8GB ram upgrade costing today less than $100 which is the maximum memory allowed on this notebook computer using two available memory upgrade slots.</p>

<p>To maximize the memory on your HP DV6 notebook  you will need to replace the memory currently installed  in your HP notebook and replace the memory upgrade modules with larger memory upgrade modules (<a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-1548159-10273954?url=http://www.crucial.com/store/affiliateredirect.asp?imodule=CT2KIT51264BC1067&amp;aid=1027395&amp;cid=777292&amp;subid=89&amp;PRS&amp;uscj&amp;cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1067">currently 8GB memory</a>), and after doing so, you will enjoy one of the fastest HP notebooks priced well under $700, just by adding more memory to your HP DV6 series notebook computer by HP.</p>

<p>I, at close to 15 years doing this – writing and tracking ram prices and memory upgrades from reputable ram vendors – I have come to realize one thing, and that’s ram gets cheaper and the standard or maximum ram size gets bigger.</p>

<p>It doesn’t seem too long ago, that a big deal with a memory upgrade was 256mb. Now that small amount of memory isn’t even an option for computers in 2011 regardless or make or manufacturer and as the years go by and the OS’s – both Mac and PC – get more and more bloated with prettier buttons and fancier features you can be sure of one thing, and that’s that all this stuff requires more RAM or memory.</p>

<p><strong>How Much Memory is Enough?</strong></p>

<p>In 2011, if you are going to make the effort and expense to upgrade the ram on your Mac or PC, I would start at 8GB, and if you have a modern computer (ie: Intel Core i3, i5, i7) then you will have no problem with adding 8GB of RAM to most modern computers today, especially for desktop computers.</p>

<p>Notebook computers on the other hand due mostly to the fact that there’s not a whole lot of space to put a memory ugprade, are a bit trickier to upgrade the RAM on, but again – 8GB RAM maximums are common on most notebook PC’s built today and although still pricey – costing as much as the notebook computer the memory is being installed in – 16GB RAM will be the defacto memory upgrade as the components for 16gb memory get cheaper over time. It wasn’t that long ago that installing 8gb of RAM in a notebook computer would cost you well over one thousand dollars, but now you can buy 8GB of notebook RAM for under $100.</p>

<p>You might be very happy running your computer with the RAM that it came from the factory and if all your computing needs happen in a web browser. (mine do) than the default 3GB or 4GB your notebook came with could very well be enough memory for facebook and the like.</p>

<p>But,if you make a living with your computer (I do, again) then 8GB is where I’d go when it comes to ram upgrades in 2011. With RAM so cheap (see ram price list below), especially for notebook computers and if you make a living with it, or just a serious hobbyist then 8GB ram upgrades from an array of memory stores are available for purchase, and all at significant savings when you compare the ram prices demanded by the computer manufacturers</p>

<div style="float: right; margin-right: 5px;">

<div style="float: right; margin-right: 5px;">
</div>

<p>Adding 8GB  of iMac RAM to a 4GB iMac depends on what specific Apple iMac you are looking at upgrading and even when it is possible, I don’t suggest it as it’s my thought that considering how cheap iMac RAM is these days, you’d be better off doing one of two upgrades:</p>

<p>For iMacs that can only accept 8GB as maximum memory and assuming your iMac ships from the factory with 4GB filling the memory slots (we’re going to assume your iMac only has two memory upgrade slots which was the case with older iMac released prior to summer 2010) you’ll have to replace the 2x2GB memory upgrades with 2x4GB memory modules to hit 8GB</p>

<p>But if you can hit 16GB on your iMac I suggest you maximize the RAM on your newer iMac (summer 2010 and  later) with the maximum memory allowed which at time of writing is 16GB of iMac RAM.</p>

<p>Adding 8GB of iMac RAM to 4GB, while in some iMac configurations is possible, doesn’t make a bunch of sense to me when for under $200 you can completely fill your iMac with the most ram it can handle.</p>

<p>For additional savings on your iMac RAM purchase you can even sell back the iMac RAM you had from the factory for even more savings off your $200 Apple iMac  RAM upgrade total price.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/OWC">OWC </a>will buy back your RAM and at the time I write this will pay you $27 for your 4GB of RAM on 2010 and 2011 Apple iMac models, that if you apply to the total cost of your new iMac 16GB upgrade (two 8GB ddr3 memory upgrade kits are required) you could have your new iMac filled with RAM for a touch over $150.00, (plus taxes, and shipping fees)</p>

<p>And speaking of fees for shipping, most online vendors offer free shipping on this much memory for iMacs, not to mention the out of state tax savings you could be eligible for as well in some cases.</p>

<p>So to answer your question: Yes you can add 8GB of iMac RAM but you’re better off either saving more money on RAM and only adding an additional 4GB or go all out and fill your iMac with as much RAM as possible, which is 16GB of iMac RAM</p>

<p>Here’s the current best and lowest RAM prices for iMac to help you decide on what size memory upgrade to get for your iMac</p>
