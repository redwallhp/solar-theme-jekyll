**An 8GB RAM Upgrade does not cost much at all. **

** **In fact, RAM for the Apple MacBook Pros released in February 2011 has never been cheaper, and if you&#8217;re looking to upgrade an older MacBook Pro from 2009 or 2010 &#8211; even though the 2011 and 2010 MacBook Pros use different RAM (1333MHz sodimms vs 1066Mhz sodimms) the prices for an upgrade to the MacBook Pro&#8217;s maximum could cost you less than $50 if you trade in your old 4GB RAM.

**Let&#8217;s have a look, shall we?**

For a 2011 MacBook Pro, regardless of screen size or cost the ram required is a[n **8GB DDR3 SDRAM sodimm memory upgrade kit**,][1] where most memory stores will happily sell you, (see ram price chart for MacBook Pros below)  but the [cheapest MacBook Pro RAM][2] currently sits at about $**[55 for  an 8GB upgrade][3]**, quite the price drop from the $90 or so the market demanded for MacBook Pro RAM just a few  months prior to today.

But to max out the memory on your MacBook Pro, you&#8217;ll need to replace the 2x2GB memory upgrade modules that shipped standard with your Apple notebook and replace them with 2x4GB memory modules.

This leaves you with an extra 4GB of MacBook Pro RAM, you&#8217;re not really sure what to do with, but you have a few options to make the upgrade from 4GB to 8GB even cheaper:

**Sell your memory online**  
[ craigslist ][4]and [ebay ][5]are great sites to make money from your old RAM, effectively reducing the total cost of your 8GB MacBook Pro RAM upgrade

**Trade in your memory **  
There&#8217;s more  than one memory store that will apply your old MacBook Pro RAM  to  the total cost of your 8GB upgrade

**Donate your memory** there&#8217;s lots of  organizations that will take your memory  donation  where they can sell it and use the proceeds from your old memory to support their cause.  [Salvation Army][6] and [Goodwill ][6]will take memory upgrade donations, or perhaps there&#8217;s a school or other way  to help others with your factory, but still perfectly usable 4GB memory upgrade.

To summarize, if you buy RAM for MacBook Pro that&#8217;s not only the cheapest it&#8217;s ever been (now is the best time to buy Apple Memory) but sell or donate the MacBook Pro&#8217;s factory installed memory you should be able to realize a total cost of under $50 for an 8GB MacBook Pro Memory Upgrade

<br>

		<div class="post-content">If you&#8217;re in the market to find the [best deal on computer parts][1] such as RAM or even hard drives and your notebook takes or requires DDR3 1333Mhz 10600 204 pin sodimms that a lot of laptops do in 2011 then you really can&#8217;t go wrong with this corsair memory module at Amazon as it&#8217;s the **[cheapest 4GB DDR3 ram for notebook][2]** I could find at Amazon, or anywhere else ( this may change over time)

[<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2601" title="Corsair DDR3 Laptop Memory Kit" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Corsair-DDR3-Laptop-Memory-Kit.jpg" alt="cheapest corsair RAM upgrade for notebooks" width="300" height="300" />][2]

&nbsp;

This 4GB RAM module is compatible with pretty much every Apple computer current in 2011:

MacBook Pro notebook computers requires the use of two of these memory upgrade modules to max out your memory in 2011, and with the iMac, and for all but the cheapest iMac &#8211; you&#8217;ll need to buy two of these memory modules to add another 8GB of iMac RAM, and with the release of the new Apple Mac Minis, this is another Apple computer that can  use the maximum of 8GB by **[buying two of these corsair 4GB RAM modules][2]**.

Of course,  there&#8217;s numerous notebook manufacturers that recommend the use of ddr3 sodimms for ram upgrades and most notebooks can take 8GB easy so make your windows machine run faster with the maximum ram possible as it&#8217;s so so cheap now.

If either saving money on RAM or the corsair brand doesn&#8217;t work for you there&#8217;s other solutions when it comes to buying 4GB DDR3 notebook memory on sale.

   <B> <h1><a href="/2011/07/apple-announces-new-2011-mac-mini-desktop-computers/">Apple Announces New 2011 Mac Mini Desktop Computers</a></h1></B>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content">**2011 Apple Mac Mini Memory**

Apple has had some pretty big news this week. New [MacBook Airs][1], New Mac OS in the form of Mac OSX Lion, and finally the cheapest Mac you can buy today in the form of the [Apple Mac Mini][2] computer:

**[The 2011 Apple Mac Mini is the Cheapest Apple Computer You Can Buy][3]**

One of the first things I tend to ask when any new model of [Apple computer][4] is introduced is **what kind of RAM does the Mac Mini require**? And, as I had guessed with the speed bump in a processor to Intel Core i5 processors also comes a speed bump in ram speed as well and with the release of this small and cheap computer from Apple the ram speed required is increased from **1066Mhz sodimms to 1333Mhz sodimms**. The maximum RAM on the Mac Minis is 8GB by installing **[two 4GB DDR3 1333MHz sodimms][5],** as per Apple although you can buy 16GB Mac Mini RAM it&#8217;s not something I suggest at this time mostly due to price: **You could have an entire lineup of Mac Minis for what a 16GB Mac Mini memory upgrade kit will cost you today.**

[table id=13 /]

The only currently shipping Mac that requires different memory is the Apple Mac Pro as it uses DDR3 SDRAM DIMMS as opposed to DDR3 SDRAM sodimms usually designed for notebook compouters. If you have more than one current 2011 Apple computer at your home or place of work, it&#8217;s quite possible for you to swap out the RAM from both or either the Apple iMac or MacBook Pro because with the release of the Mac Mini, **three out of four Macs all use the exact same memory**.

When the Mac Minis were [first introduced][6] you really were not supposed to upgrade the RAM on this small desktop as the RAM was hard to get to and would or could void your warranty.

But with the release of the 2011 Apple Mac Mini, that&#8217;s all changed (the 2010 Apple Mac Minis were the same too) and ease of memory installation on these cheap desktops is now encouraged and even promoted as a selling feature on the [Mac Mini][7] page at Apple. How times have changed.

**A word about Mac Mini RAM Upgrades  
**

If you buy memory from Apple for your Apple Mac Mini, you will very likely have no problems with your Mac Mini RAM, not to mention the fact that this makes buying a Mac Mini even easier as you can buy both the memory and computer from the same online store. (not to mention the keyboard, mouse and display too).

What Apple doesn&#8217;t tell you is that compared to other name brand memory manufacturers the ram the sell for all Apple products is very expensive. You could argue that of course generic RAM for Mac Mini is going to be the cheaper RAM, but this applies to the brand name memory too. In fact, if you want the [cheapest RAM for Mac Mini][8], regardless of brand I have found it to be from Corsair which is a reputable brand name for Mac Mini RAM. If you have another $300 to spend buy the Apple RAM but if you want to save money on RAM for the Mac Mini you have better choices that will cost you considerably less.

**2.3GHz Apple Mac Mini  
**

This is the Mac Mini I&#8217;m going to buy in the near future. If you&#8217;re like me you already have picked up an external monitor and have an extra keyboard or mouse kicking around so paying extra for all the, um, extras might not make a whole lot of sense and this Mac Mini will do just fine for a lot of us looking to use the Mac Mini as a file server, or even replacement for a new desktop computer.

**Newer Faster Processors  
** This is a long time coming this new Mac Mini refresh and even though the 2010 Mac Mini was fast, the second generation Intel i5 and i7 processors change the game and now these small desktops offer the same computing power as some other desktop computers costing more and not offering the advantages of the Apple operating system including the newly released OSX Lion &#8211; Apple&#8217;s latest and newest operating system that&#8217;s included free of charge when you buy the 2.3GHz Mac Mini.

**Connect with Thunderbolt Technology and more  
**

I saw this coming. First available with the Apple MacBook Pros it makes complete sense for Apple to include this new technology in the Mac Minis, but for some reason I can&#8217;t see or get excited about the thunderbolt port. But I&#8217;m not connecting a whole whack of peripherals at one time, and I think for most of us who want to just buy the cheapest Mac they can, this feature could be lost. What&#8217;s more important when it comes to ports on the back of the Mac Mini is the 4 USB ports and HDMI port that offers a one cable solution for connecting the Mac Mini to your HDTV. The option of being able to connect two displays to the Mac Mini at the same time makes for a nice touch though and the fact that you can use whatever peripheral you&#8217;ve got kicking around and use it with these new Macs offers more value than the thunderbolt stuff at this time.

**More, for less.  
**

I could be wrong, but if I recall the MSRP on the 2010 Mac Mini was higher at about $699 so the new Mac Mini&#8217;s don&#8217;t just offer more speed they also offer a cheaper overall price. The 2.3GHz Mac Mini is the best price you can get on a new Mac today and unless you need portability or need to buy all the apple peripherals, where the savings when you add the 2.3 GHz to the cost of the keyboard, display and mouse might mean a better deal would be to buy the cheap iMac instead as the iMac ships with all the peripherals included right out of the box.

**Faster Graphics.  
**  
This is important if you&#8217;re gaming, editing movies or simply for video playback at home you want to be sure that your graphics card is up to the task when called upon and the fastest computer won&#8217;t do you any good if there&#8217;s a bottleneck when it comes time to display. According to Apple this won&#8217;t be the case thanks to the much faster graphics card on the 2.3GHz Mac Mini as the AMD Radeon HD graphics processor with 256MB of GDDR5 memory packs more punch than ever before with some applications offering twice as fast graphics than the 2010 Mac Mini this computer replaces.

Bluetooth and Wifi are pretty standard fare in 2011 so I don&#8217;t think I need to spend too much time with these topics and suffice it to say that the 2011 Mac Mini offers both these technologies

**2.5 GHz Apple Mac Mini  
**

Apple offers an even faster Mac Mini for $799, and save for the extra $200 and faster processor: Intel Core i5 2.3GHz vs Intel Core i5 2.5Ghz, more memory (2GB vs 4GB) and a faster video card as the main differences between the two Mac Mini models, there&#8217;s not much else to write about the more expensive Mac Mini and if it were my money, I&#8217;d save it and buy more RAM and save the difference for your next Mac Mini or future Mac from Apple.

**Save Money on the 2011 Apple  Mac Mini**

It&#8217;s not much, but  if you **[buy a Mac Mini at Amazon][2]**  you can save over the full MSRP  of  what Apple charges with current savings on new Mac Minis only being $5 or so as these are new machines from Apple, it&#8217;s still a savings and worth a mention.

Also, check out MacMall for **[Mac Mini Bargains][9]**, especially if you can live with a 2010 Mac Mini as now is the time to buy a discontinued Mac Mini for even more savings as the discontinued models get liquidated to make room for the faster 2011 Mac Mini models.

It will not cost much at all to **[buy more ram for your HP notebook][1]** at the best price I could find.

In fact, if  you consider that your HP notebook already ships with some  memory that you can sell or  trade your HP notebook upgrade, regardless of model number will cost you less than you think.  Most HP notebook computers manufactured in 2011 are capable of accepting and recognizing 8GB of RAM so why not spend the $50 or so to max out your HP notebook to the maximum performance potential?

**Best Selling HP NoteBook Memory**

[<img class="size-full wp-image-2483 alignnone" title="HP ProBook 4525s XT950UT 15.6 LED Notebook (2" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/HP-ProBook-4525s-XT950UT-15.6-LED-Notebook-2.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" />][2]

&nbsp;

[**HP ProBook 4525 is priced under $500. **][2]

One of the **best selling HP notebooks** you can buy today is the HP ProBook 4525 ([currently on sale at Amazon for under $500][2]) and this notebook allows up to 8GB of RAM, yet only comes shipped with 2GB. Yet, if you replace the stock HP memory for RAM that will allow this ProBook notebook to run faster and  allow you to be more efficient you can get more work done, and the HP ProBook RAM Upgrade is pretty cheap for this notebook too. You&#8217;ll need to buy **[2x4GB DDR3 1066Mhz sdram sodimms][3] ** for this HP notebook, and as there&#8217;s only two memory upgrade slots in this HP notebook you&#8217;ll need to remove the RAM  installed in the HP ProBook 4525 and replace it with the bigger memory upgrade modules for HP notebooks.

[table id=8 /]

&nbsp;

[<img class="size-full wp-image-2484 alignnone" title="cheapest hp pavilion dm-4" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/41fJH60zaQL._SL500_AA300_.jpg" alt="best price hp dm-4" width="300" height="300" />][4]

Another **[great deal on a HP notebook][4]** right now, and  another example of how adding more RAM is the best HP notebook upgrade you can do is with the **HP Pavilion DM4-2070 notebook**. This a faster and more expensive notebook than the probook above (still a great deal on a HP computer though)  and offers **faster 2nd generation processors** than what&#8217;s in the HP ProBook. But the same applies to the HP DM4-2070 too, and even though its&#8217; a faster HP computer to begin with, when you add more memory you get a faster computer. This HP notebook computer uses RAM that&#8217;s different than the memory above and this time you need to buy **[8GB DDR3 SDRAM SODIMM][1]** notebook computer memory kits running at 1333Mhz. The maximum RAM  for the  DM4-2070 is still the maximum of 8GB (not too many notebooks offer 16GB of RAM, yet) and again you can replace the factory RAM from HP with cheaper and faster HP memory to take this HP notebook model all the way to 8GB.

[table id=7 /]

[<img class="size-full wp-image-2480 alignnone" title="HP ProBook 4530s XU015UT 15.6 LED Notebook " src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/HP-ProBook-4530s-XU015UT-15.6-LED-Notebook-2.jpg" alt="cheap HP probook memory" width="300" height="300" />][5]

[**Best Deal on HP ProBook 4530**][6]

The HP ProBook 4530 is probably the best value  today among the [best selling  notebook computers][7] as you combine the faster notebook processors running  Intel Core i3 processors and use the faster 1333Mhz DDR3 ram technology than the ProBook above. Although I&#8217;ve yet to test either HP notebook,  I can be pretty sure just due to the **memory requirements of the HP Probook 4525** that it will be the slower notebook when you compare the two computer notebooks from HP side by side.

These are just three of the current [best selling HP notebooks][8] and despite what may be differences in processor,  price and screen size and even memory requirements, there&#8217;s a theme here and  that is that every HP notebook we looked at today can take **8GB of RAM**  and that this is a big  improvement in computer speed, especially when you jump from 2GB of RAM to **[8GB of notebook RAM for HP notebook computers][1]**.

		<div class="post-content">Some stores even claim to have Apple Certified RAM, but it&#8217;s a good guess that many of these memory shops really only sell generic RAM that  meets the iMac&#8217;s technical requirements for memory upgrades. I&#8217;ve found that lately,  and completely opposite of recent  times when the only way you could get cheap iMac RAM would be to buy generic memory for the iMacs, but now in 2011 the [brand name memory has dropped  so much in price for that 8GB of iMac RAM][1] can cost just over $50 if you shop around  for some deals on iMac RAM.

In 2011, for the [iMac models introduced in May][2], these new desktop computers by Apple use the same **[1333 Mhz DDR3 sodimms][1]** that the Apple MacBook Pros use (current 2011 models) so you could effectively swap out the RAM from your iMac to your MacBook Pro. Why you&#8217;d want to do that is beyond me, but yes to upgrade RAM for the new iMacs all you have to do is be sure the memory you want to buy meets the memory requirements as determined by Apple.Yes, they do.

This applies to all four models of the iMacs too &#8211; all the way from the cheapest iMac with  the $1199 price tag, to the fastest iMac with a huge and visually stunning  27 inch LCD display. They all require DDR3 1333MHz sodimms, which are essentially notebook memory and the current memory for a lot of notebooks from brands other than Apple such as Dell, HP, Acer, and the like. It&#8217;s all the same memory.

Because I do what I do, I  have found some [pretty good prices on iMac memory][3]:

   <B> <h1><a href="/2011/07/what-are-the-disadvantages-of-a-macbook-pro/">What are the Disadvantages of  a MacBook Pro?</a></h1></B>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content">MacBook Pros aren&#8217;t that much better and are even more expensive than the MacBook Air, with the 13  inch MacBook Pro still going  to cost you $1199.oo as your cheapest MacBook Pro option and the price can go up from there &#8211; depending on the screen size and configuration you end up with.

But, back to the **MacBook Pro and  the disadvantages it may have**,  and the very first thing that came to mind is that **[MacBook Pros are freaking expensive][1]**. Even the **cheapest mac you can buy, the [Mac Mini][2]** is a $700 purchase, and the cheapest way you can get  into any MacBook of any kind  is with an **[11 inch MacBook Air][3]**. Sure, it&#8217;s got the cachet that only comes with an Apple product but for what is essentially **Apple&#8217;s answer to a netbook**, the $999 sticker price is a **lot more than you&#8217;ll pay for a netbook running the windows OS** that will probably run you about $200 or so. Is theI&#8217;m an Apple Fan, and have been for some time. In fact,  this site started as just a hobby site. I bought web hosting, taught myself some basic html and have been listing the **best prices on RAM I could find** for close to fifteen years. Not  only **[MacBook Pro RAM][4]**but also I&#8217;ve even managed to **swing a few memory deals for you folks over the years** and some stores offer ram prices that are substantially lower than you could find anywhere else and are heavily discounted just for you.

**The cloud doesn&#8217;t care about your OS.**

When I started this site and  on a Mac of course, (I think it was an Apple IIci if I recall. I&#8217;m dating myself) I had to have programs to run and files to edit and the **Apple  operating system was leaps and bounds better than anything Windows** related.

But now in 2011, I work in the  cloud. I&#8217;m writing this with a 2008  MacBook for the simple reason I see no reason to upgrade my MacBook Pro at this time with anything better or bigger. And, I can&#8217;t  believe I&#8217;m going to confess this, but **I could do just fine on a $399 (or less) windows notebook:**

The programs I use are:

**[Photoshop Elements][5]**for the odd banner or graphics tweak. There&#8217;s a windows version too. It costs less if I remember for the windows version too. (but this may have changed)

FTP Program. I use **[Transmit][6]**, and  have for years.

[WordPress][7], which is a free download.

I&#8217;ve been working away on a Windows notebook I bought a few years ago for the past month or so as a test to see if I could handle using a **[much cheaper notebook PC][8]** as my one and only computer &#8211; and  for the most  part and for my needs (yours may differ) I really don&#8217;t notice much of a difference between the two OS&#8217;s and my 15 inch HP notebook cost me a fraction of a new MacBook Pro and for what I do, does the trick just fine.

This isn&#8217;t to say that the Apple MacBook Pro isn&#8217;t really worth it, and I appreciate the way the **Mac OS just works** without  having to fiddle  with operating systems and dll files and viruses and the like, and with twenty years plus of Apple computer use under my belt, it&#8217;s  hard to train an old dog new tricks. I still can&#8217;t get used to the right click thing with the windows OS, either Vista or Windows 7.

But for the up front savings when you compare a MacBook Pro to a Windows notebook, I wonder: **will my next Mac be a Windows PC?**

**[Dell XPS 15 is a much cheaper notebook than a MacBook Pro 15 inch][1]**

Dell memory can be a good deal if you know **[where to shop for memory][2]** and like the[ Inspiron 15R 2nd  generation ][3]and [17r second  generation models][4], the higher power dells built for professionals, gamers, or anybody else needing a faster notebook than shat the Inspiron models can offer could do worse than **pick up a Dell XPS 15.**

I&#8217;ll get this out of the way now. I&#8217;m an Apple fan, but over the years as the **PC manufacturers have dropped their prices over and over** to the point where you can pay less than $500 for a well equipped Dell notebook it&#8217;s almost hard to justify the cost of a new  Apple MacBook Pro,  when the closest competitor to the MacBook, the [**Dell XPS 15** ][1]will do the job in all but a few cases, will do the job for half the price as we become more and more reliant on cloud computing and less reliant on software or operating system.  [FaceBook ][5]looks pretty much the same on both Mac or PC.

Like all things with computer shopping, you can add software, mice, faster processors and a plethora of other factors to bump up the price of your next Dell, but one  thing you should seriously consider is buying  more memory for your Dell XPS as  this is one powerful windows 7 equipped notebook PC.

<img class="size-full wp-image-2445 alignright" title="Cheap Dell XPS 15" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/71-RWyLwXVL._AA1500_.jpg" alt="Best Price on XPS 15" width="500" height="500" />

The **cheapest Dell XPS configuration** ships standard with a fast 2nd generation  processor that features an Intel Core i5 processor  running at 2.0Ghz, and out of the box ships standard with **[4GB of factory installed Dell Memory][6]**  (an aside: there&#8217;s  no such thing as special Dell memory. As long as the memory you buy meets the  Dell XPS 15 memory reqirements , you&#8217;re good to go)

But you should really **upgrade your Dell XPS 15 memory** to  the maximum ram possible  for the Dell XPS 15, as that&#8217;s an upgrade that is really going  to speed up your Dell XPS computer.

What you don&#8217;t want to do is buy the RAM from Dell when you order your Dell XPS. You can  but you will pay for the ram upgrade more  through  Dell than you would elsewhere.  At the  time I write this you can buy  **[8GB of Dell XPS RAM][7]** for about half price elsewhere than if you were buy the RAM directly from Dell when you place the Dell XPS order at Dell.com.

That&#8217;s a significant savings on Dell Memory and I keep track of  what&#8217;s  going on  with Dell Memory so you can save money when it comes time to **buy Dell XPS 15**.

Ulitmately, the answer would be to upgrade **both ram **and **hard drive for MacBook Pro **at the same time.

It&#8217;s best to upgrade both the MacBook Pro RAM and hard drive for the ultimate advantage and to get the **fastest speed out of your MacBook Pro,** regardless of whether you&#8217;re interested in upgrading a MBP for a 13 inch, 15 inch and even 17 inch model assuming you didn&#8217;t care about budget you could easily afford both a RAM upgrade and hard drive at the same time.

**Upgrade Your MacBook Pro RAM First **

[MacBook Pro RAM upgrades][1] are cheap and affordable, and a faster hard drive won&#8217;t do you any good if you&#8217;ve got a bottleneck with RAM and the processor is relying on much slower swap disc when it comes to needing to access data quickly and efficiently. If you&#8217;re just browsing the web, and what has become an increasing activity over time, and will only get more and more prevalent as time goes on thanks in part to the release of Apple&#8217;s iCloud there&#8217;s a good chance you don&#8217;t have to upgrade the memory on your Apple pro notebook computer.

But RAM for MacBook Pro in 2011 is the **[cheapest it&#8217;s been in some time][2]**, so if you were wondering on when to [buy Apple memory][3], the time would be now as **prices have never been lower for MacBook ram than right now**. It&#8217;s the lowest I have seen ram prices and you can now **[buy 8GB of MacBook RAM for well under $100][2].** You can also order 16GB memory but for the time being it&#8217;s still too pricey for me to recommend unless you have deep pockets or need the most memory you can install in a MacBook Pro regardless of Cost.

**Buy a Faster Hard Drive  
**

[<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2430" title="Cheapest Solid State Hard Drive" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screen-shot-2011-07-07-at-2.53.37-PM.png" alt="Solid state hard drive under $100" width="298" height="260" />][4]

Your MacBook Pro already comes shipped with a fast hard drive installed, and the only way to really upgrade the MacBook Pro hard drive would be to upgrade to a larger sized hard drive that won&#8217;t really speed things up, but rather just allow you more space for your files, movies and images.

The best bet for a MacBook Pro hard drive upgrade in 2011 is to convert or swap out the hard drive in your MacBook Pro for a much more dependable and [faster solid state hard drive][5]. The downside to this advice is that to get a large SSD hard drive installed in your MacBook Pro you&#8217;re looking at big bucks. A 500gb solid state hard isn&#8217;t really available yet and even a 250GB solid state hard drive comes with a sticker price of $600, and that is in my opinion still too expensive.

But, if you can live with the smaller hard drive space a **[64GB solid state hard drive][4]** is **cheap and affordable solid state hard drive** and at the time of writing just under $100 too. What you could do, is install your MacBook hard drive in an [external hard drive case][6] allowing you the best of both worlds: A fast solid state hard drive for fast startup and access to commonly used files and and with your factory MacBook Pro hard drive installed in an external USB case you now have space for your less often used files or for a backup and you still make good use out of the factory MacBook Pro hard drive.

**Upgrade MacBook Pro Hard Drive and RAM  
**

If you really shop around, you can **max out the ram on your MacBook Pro for well under $100** and **[add a 64GB solid state hard drive][4]** for right at the $100 mark. Add a negligible cost for your USB hard drive case and you&#8217;ve got the **most ram and a faster hard drive in your MacBook Pro for under $200** (plus taxes, and shipping). If I were to **buy a new MacBook Pro**, or even wanted to **upgrade an older MacBook Pro** this is the route I would go as once you spend the relatively cheap amount of about $200 you are taking full advantage of the technology hidden inside your Apple MacBook Pro notebook computer.

   <B> <h1><a href="/2011/07/what-is-the-best-amount-of-computer-memory/">What is the Best Amount of Computer Memory?</a></h1></B>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content">**8GB Memory is the [most affordable and most popular][1] computer memory upgrade today**

The answer to this question changes over the years, and ten years ago 1GB of RAM seemed like an unthinkable  amount of  computer ram to have installed and the price was just as unthinkable with it not uncommon to see RAM upgrades for 1GB  sell for one thousand dollars or more, but in 2011 not only have the memory modules gotten bigger over time, they have also gotten cheaper over time too, which means you spend  less money for more RAM upgrades now than ever before.

The good news for  most computer users is that  **today&#8217;s computers ship with enough RAM** to run the installed applications such as Windows 7 or Mac OSX and usually a web browser or two and for some every day computer users who just need to check the  weather and browse facebook then the factory  installed RAM is more than ample of an upgrade as we get closer and  closer to location free computing thanks to being able to work in the cloud.

But for the rest of us who like to get some work done, or play games  or edit videos  &#8211; the more RAM you have , the better. **There&#8217;s no such thing as having too much RAM.**

Out of the box, notebook computers, probably the best selling computer today ship from the factory with 3 or 4GB of RAM already installed but  **most notebooks today can use up to 8GB  of RAM** with a few high powered graphics or business notebooks being able to accept 16GB of RAM, but the average and best selling ram upgrade is th**e [8GB DDR3 SDRAM memory upgrade kit][1]**.

**8GB of RAM for desktop or notebooks in 2011** is the current sweet spot for memory upgrades. 4GB ram, while cheaper than 8GB obviously doesn&#8217;t double the RAM in your computer which is what you&#8217;re trying to do when you&#8217;re ready to buy RAM and 16GB RAM isn&#8217;t priced affordably enough yet to make the cost worthwhile for all but a few power users or early adapters to the bigger 8GB memory sodimms that are required as most notebooks can&#8217;t hold more than two memory upgrade modules at  a time.

**8GB Memory Prices**

**8GB DDR3 sodimms** are the best selling and  most popular memory upgrade to date for computers, especially notebook and laptop computers
