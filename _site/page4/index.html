		<div class="post-content">I always had a soft spot for the Duo and back in the day could only afford the grayscale versions as the color was too rich for my blood. But, I did at one time own a duo dock and I always thought it was a great idea to dock your notebook to a bigger desktop when you got back to the office. 

But these older Duo docks tend to fail after a while: 

> Typical Symptoms
> 
> There is a periodic ticking from the dock, particularly after periods of being unplugged.
> This can become more frequent. In mild cases, the ticking will go away after the dock has been plugged in for an hour or two. In other cases, the dock ticks just after the Duo is ejected and may continue ticking for a while.
> Eventually, the dock becomes useless as it ticks instead of working. If the Duo is stuck inside, and won't eject, you may need to take the lid off to get it out. To do that, thin screwdrivers will be needed to press on the tabs since the Duo is in the way. Or you can wait and hope the ticking goes away and the Dock comes back to life for proper ejection.
> Avoiding having the dock unplugged seems to postpone the inevitable degeneration to uselessness.


The instructions on this page will get your old Duo dock up and running again:

[upgrade or new MacBook (for architect, Parallels)?](https://www.macintouch.com/forums/showthread.php?tid=566&pid=3984#pid3984)


Personally, I would go for the SSD and ram upgrade. I don't need much storage space thanks to the cloud and could easily get by with a 129GB SSD and 4GB of RAM. 

In fact, I've done this. I have a 2008 iMac that runs perfectly with these upgrades. 

New Macs are expensive.

It's got both a USB 3.0 port AND lightning port so you can easily transfer your data from your Mac to iOS device. 

It's kind of pricey though at about $100.00

Dan Knight on Chrome OS: 

> Chrome OS is aimed at the low end of the personal computing market. It’s designed so most of your work is done online using your browser with your documents stored on Google’s servers. That reduces the amount of storage a Chrome computer needs. And since 3D gaming isn’t part of the target market, manufacturers don’t need to use expensive GPUs to provide a good user experience.

I have completely switched to Chrome OS and I don't miss the Mac and it's high prices.
