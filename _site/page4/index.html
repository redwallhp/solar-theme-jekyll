    <h1><a href="/2011/10/what-is-the-sweet-spot-for-hp-envy-ram/">What is the Sweet Spot for HP Envy RAM?</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>The HP envy is a fast notebook computer from HP designed for the professional notebook user in mind. Sure, there are cheaper notebooks from HP that do the job when it comes to the simple stuf like web browsing and social networking, but if you want to play games or get work done you need a more powerful processor the HP Envy provides.</p>

<p>Take the popular <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051OLNHE/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B0051OLNHE">HP ENVY 14-2050SE Beats Special Edition notebook</a> for example. This HP Envy notebook already comes with 6GB of RAM as default memory and if your notebook computing needs are light you can stop reading right here. **6GB of RAM is enough for web surfing or blogging or any other lighter computer task.<br />
**</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051OLNHE/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B0051OLNHE"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3259" title="HP Envy Beats special edition" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Screen-Shot-2011-10-19-at-5.15.02-PM.png" alt="HP Envy SSD Deals" width="305" height="279" /></a></p>

<p>But, if you need to do some work or play games the maximum RAM for this particular notebook tops out at 16GB of RAM, but this ram upgrade for HP Envy’s is still a tad pricey at $600 or so and so you’re much better off if you limit your HP Envy RAM needs to 8GB for the time being.</p>

<p>If you want to save money and seeing as this particular HP Envy already ships with 6GB when shipped from HP you could forgo a ram upgrade altogether as there’s really <strong>little difference between 6GB of RAM and 8GB for HP Envy notebooks</strong>. Even though RAM for HP Envy notebooks are pretty cheap, you would be much better off forgetting about a RAM upgrade for HP notebooks and installing a solid state drive into your HP Envy laptop instead if you feel the need to maximize the performance of your HP laptop.</p>

<p>The benefits of a faster solid state hard drive far outweigh any advantage you would see by adding just 2GB of RAM to a 6GB equipped HP notebook already. But, by swapping out the factory HP envy drive with the faster SSD you’ll spend just a bit more as <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004W2JKWG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B004W2JKWG">quality name brand SSD drives are on sale</a></strong> for about $100 these days and up. Still a bit pricey, but when compared to the cost of 16GB for HP envy, the solid state drive is the best upgrade for the HP notebook you can buy in 2011.</p>

<p>Wait until we’re a few months into 2012 at least before you consider upgrading the HP envy RAM to the maximum of 16GB allowed and just get by with the 6GB for now. Save your money for a much cheaper 16GB ram upgrade next year as the prices for 8GB laptop memory will continue to drop to a more stable level and <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/deal-ocz-technology-60-gb-vertex-2-series-sata-ii-2-5-inch-solid-state-drive-ssd-drops-to-under-100/" title="Deal. OCZ Technology 60 GB Vertex 2 Series SATA II 2.5-Inch Solid State Drive (SSD) Drops to Under $100">buy a cheap solid state hard drive </a> instead if you want to upgrade you  HP envy notebook.</p>

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>I have mentioned before I am *this close* to moving to the USA and one of the things that the USA offers over Canada is choice. I can choose  my internet provider, home  phone service, even email web host to be three different companies offering services, or.. you can buy all three online services from one provider and in my case that would be from Verizon as I already have Verizon wireless service from them and might as well pay one bill for all three and probably save some money in the process.</p>

<h2 id="introducing-verizoncentral">Introducing VerizonCentral</h2>

<p>Verizon Central is a website that’s a front door or portal or everyday start page for your browser which allows you not  only quick and easy login to your verizon wireless account, but a slew of other features including news, weather and other fun stuff too:</p>

<p><strong>Most Popular News</strong></p>

<p>This is pretty self explanatory. The biggest news of the day is displayed here, and constantly updates.</p>

<p><strong>More News</strong></p>

<p>In addition to the headline news, there’s more news in not only the news, but also in Entertainment, Sports, Today’s Deal of the Day, and the trending today chart offers what’s hot when you search using Verizon Central. Local News is  also offered so not only do you get to read international  and national news, you’ll be up to date in your community thanks to Verizon Central.</p>

<p><strong>Watch TV Online. </strong></p>

<p>This might be the biggest advantage to Verizon Central – the ability to watch TV right from your computer.</p>

<p><strong>Today in History </strong></p>

<p>This section allows you to look back at what was happening not only a year ago today, but also for other dates in history  that share the same date as today.</p>

<p><strong>Verizon Sign In</strong></p>

<p>Maybe I should have put this right at the top, but this might be the main reason you visit Verizon Central – to login to your Verizon Account, and  the Verizon web portal allows you to do just that with ease. Of course, you can also register for a Verizon Central Account if you don’t have one yet too.</p>

<p>**Local Weather Forecasts **keep you up to date on not only the latest weather conditions in your area, but also what’s in store for the weather in the upcoming days.</p>

<p>The Verizon Central Web Portal is a very good way to start your day and keeps you up to date and entertained as well with all the news and topics important  to you.</p>

<p>**VerizonEmail **When you sign up for Verizon cable services, you get a free and easy to remember email address for your personal email. In my case, my verizon email adresss might be ramseeker@verizon.net which is pretty easy to remember when you think about it compared to some of the domain extensions from other internet service providers.</p>

<p>Apple has long set a standard of regular updates to their computer model lines—often at intervals of just a few months.  The MacBook Pro line, however, had, until the introduction in early 2011 of the Apple MacBook Pro 2.3GHz Intel Core i5 13 inch (and its 15 and 17 inch siblings), gone almost a year without updating this product line.</p>

<p>The wait turned out to be well worth it, however, as the Apple MacBook Pro 2.3GHz Intel Core i5 13 inch as the improvements included upgrades to processors, brand new graphic processors, as well as a new peripheral connector.</p>

<p>Starting at a price of $1199 13-inch model featured a 2.3GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor and a 5400-rpm 320GB hard drive.  The i5 was one of Intel’s latest generation of the Core series of processors, also referred to as “Sandy bridge”.  Processor, cache, integrated graphics and memory controller all reside on the same die in the Sandy Bridge configuration, and also now feature the HD Graphics 3000 integrated graphics processor, which had only  previously been available in higher end Apple models. In ratings published in the magazine PC World, the 13 inch MacBook Pro i5 was rated 41 to 57 percent faster than the previous MacBook generation.</p>

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>Apple MacBook Pro 2.3GHz Intel Core i7 (15-inch DDR3) was first introduced in February of 2011 featured Intel’s recently refined chipsets. The new Intel Core i7 architecture put the processor, cache, memory controller and graphics engine on a single chip—an innovative step that reduced the distance that data had to travel, thereby vastly increasing performance as well as processing efficiency.</p>

<p>The MacBook Pro 2.3 GHz Intel Core i7 15 inch boasted Turbo Boost 2.0 an even more efficient version of the original Turbo Boost which was described by Apple as a “dynamic performance technology that dramatically increases the speed of active cores”. Turbo Boost 2.0 worked by automatically shifting core frequency in smaller increments, which allows the processor to manage performance without a loss of efficiency and because this happens automatically—the user notices only that their computing is faster and smoother.<br />
Further enhancing speed in the MacBook Pro 2.3 GHz i7 15 inch was the now standard use of hyper-threading technology.</p>

<p>This dynamic processor improvement enabled two threads to run simultaneously on each core. The end result was that Mac OSX could now recognize eight cores on a quad core processor, four on a dual core processor. To the end user, this translated to tasks spread evenly across a greater number of cores so that multiple applications could be run simultaneously more smoothly, quickly and reliably.</p>

<p>Dubbed as the new convertible, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004XZMCAY/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B004XZMCAY">Dell Inspiron Convertible Tablet PC</a> converts from being both an easy to use touch based  tablet to a more conventional notebook PC all with a twist of the LCD display. Rotate the display  depending on your computing needs. Never have to ask yourself which notebook you should buy or which tablet to buy because this stylish device satisfies both your notebook PC and tablet needs in an all in one design eliminating the need to buy or worse, carry two devices for your portable computing needs.</p>

<p>The memory upgrade options are rather limited for this unique and portable netbook but you can, and should max out the Dell Inspiron Duo to the maximum memory of 2GB by uprading the one memory upgrade slot with a 2GB DDR3 1333Mhz sodimm <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">ram upgrade for the Dell Inspiron Duo</a></p>

<p>Unlike the Duo netbook or tablet above, the Dell Inspiron R laptops are the perfect solution for both home and office computing thanks to unique features such as switch lids to customize the appearance of your Dell Inspiron notebook. (Personally, I think switch lids or any other sticker for you notebook is a complete waste of money, but to each their own)</p>

<p>Like the smaller Dell 14R,  the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004XZMCAY/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B004XZMCAY">15R from Dell</a> offers more screen real estate, a second generation Intel i3 processor running at 2.2 GHz, a 640Gb internal hard drive and 6GB of RAM as standard equipment all for a sale price of just over $500, which isn’t too bad a deal on a Dell. Understandably the Dell Inspiron  15R is one of the best selling notebook computers from this well known name brand  notebook computer manufacturer. While 6GB of RAM installed from the factory is a respectable amount, the Dell Inspiron 15R  will perform even better with a Dell Inspiron Upgrade and  <a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT2KIT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1339">8GB of RAM for the Dell 15R</a> is so cheap it makes sense to upgrade the RAM on your Dell 15R. For further savings you can sell the old ram in your Dell and apply the proceeds to the newer and bigger Dell 15R Memory Upgrade Kit.</p>

<div>
  Regardless of what Apple iMac you want to buy this year, from the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004YKXGIK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B004YKXGIK">cheapest Apple iMac</a> to the most expensive and most impressive, 27 inch Apple iMac  running at 3.1 GHz, <strong>you should max out the ram on these popular Apple desktop computers</strong>  as RAM has never been cheaper and time of writing you can fill your Apple iMac with memory for under $100, an unthinkable price not too long ago.
</div>

<p><strong>Can the Apple iMac take 32GB of RAM? </strong></p>

<p>Officially, no. According to the good folks at Apple the iMac maxes out at 16GB, but that’s before you could easily <a href="http://www.kqzyfj.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT102464BF1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT102464BF1339">buy 8GB sodimm memory modules for Apple iMac</a>. These larger memory modules were not available to purchase when the iMac was released in May 2011, so the <strong>official maximum ram of 16GB is what is supported by Apple</strong> and if you want to have your warranty intact, you may want to consider this.</p>

<p>That said, <strong>32GB iMac RAM</strong> just requires you to <a href="http://www.kqzyfj.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT102464BF1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT102464BF1339">buy 4x8GB sodimms</a>. These 8GB memory modules are far from the cheapest Apple computer memory available, and you may want to consider <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ZR4M6I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=B003ZR4M6I">buying a Mac Pro instead</a>, where the cost to fill your Mac to 32GB  is not only cheaper, but is recommended and approved by Apple. If you need 32GB of RAM in a desktop,  it’s my opinion you’re better off with the Apple Mac Pro.</p>

<p>This is the <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004YLCLM6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B004YLCLM6">cheapest Apple desktop computer</a></strong> you can buy, and with a release date of July 2011, also one of the latest and greatest Apple Computers to be announced by Apple this year to date.  With the small footprint and flexibility of the choice of perhipherals to use with the Mac Mini, this may just be the best Apple computer to come out of Apple in 2011.</p>

<p>The Mac Mini is available in two configurations:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004YLCLM6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B004YLCLM6">Apple Mac Mini 2.3 GHz Intel Core i5 processor</a> $599.99 (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004YLCLM6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B004YLCLM6"> click for sale price </a>)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004YLCN1U/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B004YLCN1U">Apple Mac Mini 2.5 GHz Intel Core i5 processor</a> $799.99 (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004YLCLM6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B004YLCLM6">click for sale price</a>)</p>

<p>Regardless of what Mac Mini you choose. (I would go with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004YLCLM6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B004YLCLM6">cheaper $599 Mac Mini</a> and  use the $200 savings towards buying new peripherals) these new 2911 Apple  Mac Mini’s are real easy to upgrade the RAM on and with the exception of the Mac Pro might be the easiest Mac to add memory upgrades to. If you can unscrew the lid on a jar of peanut butter you can upgrade mac mini RAM with ease.</p>

<p>And you should <strong><a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT2KIT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1339">upgrade the RAM on the Mac Mini to the maximum allowed of 8GB</a></strong>.  The cheap Mac Mini comes out of the box with just 2GB of RAM installed so it’s a perfect candidate for a memory <strong><a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT2KIT51264BC1067%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1067">upgrade all the way to 8GB</a></strong> as is the 4GB 2.5GHz  Mac Mini which does benefit from more RAM installed at the factory, but you will pay for it. In addition to the faster processor with the Apple Mac Mini, you’re also paying considerably more for the 4GB of RAM over where you could buy  it from a brand name ram vendor such as <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">Crucial </a>or Corsair or Kingston, which offer more value when it comes to Apple RAM Upgrades. The street price of  a 2GB RAM upgrade is only about $10 at time of writing.</p>

<p>And despite what the <a href="http://www.apple.com/macmini/specs.html">Apple Store may tell you</a> you <strong>don’t need to buy RAM from Apple for your Mac Mini</strong>.  As long as you buy ram from a reputable memory store like <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">Crucial</a>, you will have no problem when it comes to add RAM to your brand new 2011 Apple Mac Mini.</p>

<p><strong>Can I install 16GB of RAM into the 2011 Apple Mac Mini?</strong></p>

<p>Like the case  for <strong>32GB for the Apple iMac</strong>,  the answer is twofold: yes, but no.</p>

<p>Yes, you can upgrade the Apple Mac Mini to 16GB  because  the Apple Mac Mini accepts two <a href="http://www.kqzyfj.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT102464BF1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT102464BF1339">8GB 1333Mhz SDRAM sodimms</a>, and back in July 8GB sodimms for Apple Mac Mini were rare and thus, really pricey – costing more than the Mac Mini  itself. Things have changed a bit since and <strong>8GB ram modules for Mac Mini are starting to drop in price</strong> some, but you will still pay a pretty penny to get 16GB of RAM for Mac Mini this year.</p>

<p>The second part of the answer  is that <strong>Apple only supports 8GB  of RAM in these small desktop computers</strong>. If you install 8GB x 2 to get to 16GB you should have no problem with that much Mac Mini ram installed, but in the rare case things go amuck when you install the 16GB of RAM you’re on your own. It’s very doubtful that the Apple limited warranty would cover installing more memory than what was supported. It’s always been my policy to recommend you stick to the maximum RAM as per Apple. 8GB of memory upgrades for Mac Mini should be more than enough RAM if you’re using the Mac Mini for home office, home or school tasks.</p>

<p>If you do need a Mac with 16GB you should buy an iMac or Mac Pro, which offers both faster processors as well as added memory upgrade capacity.</p>

<h2 id="apple-mac-pro-memory-upgrades">Apple Mac Pro Memory Upgrades</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ZR4M6I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=B003ZR4M6I"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1478" title="Buy Mac Pro" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Screen-shot-2011-03-26-at-2.03.40-PM2.png" alt="Best Macintosh Pro" width="159" height="259" /></a></p>

<p>The Apple Mac Pro from Apple is getting long in the tooth and we have yet to see a 2011 Apple Mac Pro release from Apple this year  for their professional based desktop computer and the newest  Apple Mac Pro you can buy has a release date of August 10, 2010, over a year ago.</p>

<p>But regardless of age of the current Mac Pro lineup, these are still considered new computers and are available as such in 2011.</p>

<p>Available as either a 8 Core configuration featuring</p>

<ul>
  <li>Two 2.4GHz Quad-Core Intel Xeon E5620 “Westmere” processors</li>
</ul>

<p>or one Quad core processor Mac Pro  featuring</p>

<ul>
  <li>One 2.8GHz Quad-Core Intel Xeon W3530 “Nehalem” processor as the standard processor configuration</li>
</ul>

<div>
  The memory you need for the Apple Mac Pro gets a little tricky as even though they are considered new Apple Mac Pro models the processor  speed and type determines  what memory upgrade you need to buy:
</div>

<div>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Dual-processor systems</strong> <ul>
        <li>
          2.4GHz system: 1066MHz DDR3 ECC SDRAM
        </li>
        <li>
          2.66GHz and 2.93GHz systems: 1333MHz DDR3 ECC SDRAM
        </li>
        <li>
          Eight memory slots (four per processor) supporting up to 64GB of main memory using 1GB, 2GB, 4GB, or 8GB DIMMs
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      <strong>Single Processor systems</strong> <ul>
        <li>
          2.8GHz and 3.2GHz systems: 1066MHz DDR3 ECC SDRAM
        </li>
        <li>
          3.33GHz system: 1333MHz DDR3 ECC SDRAM
        </li>
        <li>
          Four memory slots supporting up to 32GB of main memory using 1GB, 2GB, 4GB, or 8GB DIMM
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <div>
    As you can see from the chart above, there&#8217;s many choices when it comes to Apple Mac Pro memory so be sure to buy the right speed of memory for Mac  Pro whether you need to buy Mac Pro 1333GHz or Mac Pro 1066GHz RAM, as it can be confusing  and you want to be certain you match  the right ram for the right Mac Pro.
  </div>
  
  <div>
    My guess, and the <a href="http://www.macrumors.com">Mac Pro Rumors</a> tend  to confirm this, is that there&#8217;s a Mac Pro refresh in the works  that will not only allow for faster processors but will sychronize the ram requirements so that all new 2011 Apple Mac Pro models use the  same memory type, just like all the  other Apple computer models do.
  </div>
</div>

<h3 id="can-the-apple-mac-pro-accept-64gb-of-ram">Can the Apple Mac Pro Accept 64GB of RAM?</h3>

<p>Like the Apple iMac and Mac Mini above, the technical answer is no if you have the single processor. The single  processor Mac Pros max out at  32GB of RAM. The dual processsor Mac Pro systems can in fact accept 64GB of RAM if you have the budget for it. 64GB of RAM for Mac Pro is not cheap and unless you really need the fastest desktop possible to get your work done faster, you may be able to get away with 32GB of Mac Pro Memory.</p>

<p>The MacBook Pro is my favorite Apple Computer when it comes to Apple portables and when you consider what it costs to buy a MacBook Pro in the first place, a MacBook Pro RAM upgrade is a no brainer if you ask me.  Like the <a href="http://www.nike.com">Nike </a>ad says ‘just do it’.</p>

<p>The 2011 Apple MacBook Pro lineup consists of five different models to choose from:</p>

<p>editor’s note: I would buy the cheapest MacBook Pro which in this case is the 13 inch MBP and use the money you saved for the next upgrade MacBook Pro, which might be as early as late 2011 and then use the savings from not buying the more expensive MacBook Pro’s to put towards the  2012 MacBook Pros when they are released in just a few short months. This is just one strategy to saving money on not only RAM, but also the computer the memory is being installed into.</p>

<p>But regardless of what Apple MacBook Pro you already own or are  considering buying upgrade the RAM to the maximum using a 8GB DDR3 SDRAM sodimm memory upgrade kit.  8GB MacBook Pro memory is so cheap  that it makes absolutely no sense to me why you run the stock MacBook Pro ram configuration when for under $50 you can max out  the RAM on your MacBook Pro</p>

<p><strong>Can I Upgrade MacBook Pro Memory to 16GB?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, you can. You need  to buy 8GB 1333Mhz sodimms  on sale and install them in the two memory upgrade banks or sockets available for an upgrade by removing the stock Apple RAM with more advanced and high quality 8GB laptop memory. The problem with adding 16GB MacBook Pro memory is that it’s still pretty pricey and could cost as much as the MacBook Pro you’re installing the 16GB upgrade into.</p>

<p>You’re better off with 8GB of MacBook Pro Memory. 8GB is the deal when it comes to Apple MacBook Pro Memory Upgrades. 16GB is still too expensive in 2011 to be a worthwhile upgrade.  Besides, installing 16GB into a MBP is not something that Apple recommends and neither can I. You may void your warranty by installing more memory than what is the maximum at time of release. I’d stick to 8GB and enjoy the Apple MacBook Pro with a full warranty intact.</p>

<p>As you can see from the Apple MacBook Air lineup  for 2011,  the cheapest MacBook Air comes pretty much crippled with lack of RAM and all could use at least 8GB MacBook Air Memory to really make these small and fast notebooks from Apple shine, but Apple decided to make the maximum ram  at 4GB. Considering the Mac OS Lion requires 1GB of RAM, that doesn’t leave you with a lot of memory to play around with. That said, these are consumer based notebooks not professional notebooks and with the MacBook Air you get true plug and play as there are no upgrades  you can, or need to perform when you buy a MacBook Air as opposed to the Apple MacBook Pro that requires a ram upgrade to really see what  the MBP can do.</p>

<p>It’s easier to show you <a href="http://www.apple.com">where not to buy memory</a> upgrades for Apple computers than to provide you with a list of all the great stores you can <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/where-to-buy-computer-memory-upgrades/">buy memory upgrades</a> from, but you can get a great deal on RAM  for Apple without much trouble at all and if you’re in  the market for name brand memory such as <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">Crucial Technology RAM</a> , or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;ref_=nb_sb_ss_i_0_15&amp;field-keywords=kingston%20memory%20ddr3&amp;url=search-alias%3Delectronics&amp;sprefix=kingston%20memory&amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">Kingston </a>or Corsair, now is te best time in the 15 years I have been checking ram prices for Apple computers online. <strong>8GB of RAM for the iMacs, MacBook Pro or the Mac Mini in 2011 has dropped in price to half what it was just a few months ago</strong>, so if you’ve been sitting on the fence waiting to buy ram, don’t wait much longer as  I can’t forecast ram prices getting  much lower than they already have been.</p>

<p>If you have already have a new 2011 Mac but have been watching for ram prices to drop, again you really should upgrade the ram on your new Mac at your earliest convenience. The Apple computers are far from the cheapest computer you can  buy comparable PC’s for much less but the benefit of Apple over other brands of computers is that they tend to hold their resale value and adding RAM is just one more way to not only increase your day to day productivity but also increase the value of your Mac when it’s  time for an Apple Computer upgrade for your next new Apple computer.</p>

** In our increasingly mobile, fast paced society–the need for processing speed on laptop and notebook computers has created a second issue of importance for end users: longer battery life. With business and professional users of the Apple product line travelling more and working increasingly from venues outside the office cubicle the need for longer battery life was increasingly important.</p>

<p>Apple introduced the Apple MacBook Pro 2.8GHz Intel Core 2 Duo 15” in the summer of 2009 to address this issue with its “innovative built-in battery for up to 40 percent longer battery life.”</p>

<p>In the past, a longer lived battery meant adding more bulk to the computer, a major selling point of the Apple MacBook Pro2.8GHz 15” was the fact that this model and those subsequent extended useable wireless battery power to seven hours on a single charge without adding to the size, weight or price of the unit. Distinguished by “Adaptive Charging”, the new battery iteration promised to deliver up to 1000 recharges before reaching 80 percent of original capacity. This innovation was at the time nearly three times the lifespan of conventional computer batteries. Not only was longer battery life attractive in terms of end use, the increasingly “Green” conscious consumer could well appreciate that longer battery life means fewer depleted batteries and less waste. Further appeal to the environmentally minded, this model along with the entire MacBook Pro line up achieved EPEAT* Gold status and meets Energy Star 5.0 requirements a new standard for environmentally friendly notebook design.</p>

<p>The Apple MacBook Pro2.8GHz 15” included the equally green LED backlit display, renowned for its greater color intensity with a 1440 x 900 standard resolution; the processor a speedy 2.8 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo with 6MB shared L2 cache. This model also featured the glass Multi-Touch™ trackpad, an illuminated keyboard, an SD card or ExpressCard slot, a FireWire® 800 port and state of the art NVIDIA graphics married with a 2.8 GHz Core 2 Duo processor, a 500 GB hard drive.</p>

<p>The Apple MacBook Pro2.8GHz 15” offered the following features:</p>

<p>Lightweight, environmentally friendly aluminum unibody case;</p>

<p>1066 MHz front-side bus;</p>

<p>500GB serial ATA hard drive running at 5400 rpm, with Sudden Motion Sensor;</p>

<p>Apple touted the MacBook Pro 2.66 GHz Intel Core i7 17 inch as the next significant upgrade in processor speed, stating that “17-inch MacBook Pro models are up to 50 percent faster than the previous systems”. The i7 processors used Intel’s state-of-the-art 32 nanometer process, integrating the memory controller and Level 3 cache for faster access to system memory. Hyper-Threading technology improved data throughput by creating virtual processing cores, while Turbo Boost optimized performance between the two processor cores, accelerating the system from 2.66 GHz to 3.06 GHz for intensive dual core tasks, and up to 3.33 GHz for single core tasks.</p>

<p>Apple also kept cranking out the graphic innovations in true Apple style with the introduction of the then new automatic graphics switching technology that toggled between powerful NVIDIA GeForce GT 330M and energy efficient Intel HD Graphics processors resulting in crisp graphics capable of supporting the most demanding 3D games, creative software and technical applications. The new graphics technology automatically determined which processor a particular application required and switched instantly to deliver high level performance. By integrating hardware and software closely, Apple was able to deliver the lauded 10 hours on a single charge of the built in battery.</p>

<p>The Apple Mac Mini is my new favorite Mac in the Apple lineup and for one reason: It’s cheap.</p>

<p>I have already compared the iMac and Mac Mini and when you do the math, it’s not hard to save up  to $300 when you buy a Mac Mini and external mouse, monitor, and keyboard as opposed to pulling the trigger on an iMac.</p>

<p>What could you do with the extra money you save? Buy a SSD drive, as they are getting big enough and cheap enough to use as your main hard drive. (with limitations). The biggest limitation being your budget, and remembering that you’re looking to upgrade a $600 desktop here. You have to stop and ask yourself is it really worth it to pour another $500 or so into it. If you add 16GB of RAM in addition to the Mac Mini, you may just be better off buying a Mac Pro.</p>

<p>Regardless, the Mac Mini SSD Drive options are many and here’s a few options to consider: These will also work just fine in your MacBook Pro and iMacs too.</p>

<h3 id="crucial-128-gb-m4-25-inch-solid-state-drive-sata-6gbs-ct128m4ssd2img-classalignleft-size-full-wp-image-3076-titlebest-crucial-ssd-drive-for-mac-mini-srchttpwwwramseekercomwp-contentuploads201110screen-shot-2011-10-07-at-72719-ampng-altcheap-mac-mini-ssd-drive-width312-height242-1"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004W2JKZI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B004W2JKZI">Crucial 128 GB m4 2.5-Inch Solid State Drive SATA 6Gb/s CT128M4SSD2<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3076" title="Best Crucial SSD Drive for Mac Mini" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Screen-Shot-2011-10-07-at-7.27.19-AM.png" alt="Cheap Mac Mini SSD Drive" width="312" height="242" /></a></h3>

<p>With a street price of under $200, the latest in solid state drive technology from Crucial comes in the form of the Crucial 128MB M4 SSD drive. At just 128MB, you may be limited in your storage space when compared to bigger conventional hard drives but you win when it comes to boot time and drive access speed, allowing you to work faster</p>

<p>The crucial m4 128MB solid state drive is the best selling SSD drive today, and is compatible with more than just the Apple Mac Mini, but works with all others in the Apple lineup and any other Windows OS model that can accept a 2.5 inch SATA form factor.</p>

A hundred dollar SSD upgrade is the best bargain for a Mac Mini SSD option as it allows fast access to common files and the Mac OS for super fast startup times, yet doesn’t cost too much compared to the Mac Mini. Upgrade the Mac Min RAM to 8Gb at the same time, and for $150 or less, you have a much faster Mac Mini when you bought the Mac Mini from Apple.</p>

<p><strong>June 2012</strong> – Finally after what seemed like an eternal wait for new 2012 Apple MacBooks, they have arrived!<br />
 </p>

<p>The Apple MacBook Air is the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005CWHZP4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B005CWHZP4" title="macbook air is the best mac notebook until 2012">Mac Portable To Buy</a> in 2011 as we wait for the release of the 2012 MacBook Pro</p>

<p>It’s October already as I write this and if it were earlier this spring, I would have said that hands down, buy a new MacBook Pro today as they are fast and well designed notebook computers featuring fast processors. And with the capability, unofficially at least  – to accept  16GB of RAM.</p>

<p>The biggest question you may have had back then earlier in 2011 was which MacBook Pro Do I Buy? With 5 different models of MacBook Pros, such as the cheapest MacBook Pro out of the bunch, the 13inch MBP to the desktop replacement 17 inch MacBook Pros these new Apple notebooks came in enough different sizes and  price points that there would be a MacBook Pro for every need.</p>

<p>And then time slipped by and this summer we saw the release of  new Apple iMacs in May, the MacBook Air refresh in July, and the Mac Mini update happening in July too.  And suddenly, the once fast and fresh MacBook Pros lost a little bit of their lustre.</p>

<p>If you need to buy a Mac Desktop computer, the Mac Mini is the cheapest Mac you’ll see this year and is fast enough for most every day calculations, and even with the added cost of a monitor and keyboard and mouse, the Apple Mac Mini is still cheaper than an Apple iMac.</p>

<p>Then there’s the MacBook Air models, and  if you’re in the market for  a new MacBook Pro, you may want to consider these lightweight and fast notebooks instead of buying a MacBook Pro as they are currently the lightest and fastest notebook you can buy from Apple.</p>

<p>But what if you don’t want to buy a desktop Mac, as you need something portable and the MacBook Pros that were released in 2011 are looking a little dated.  This leaves you with three choices:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Buy a 2011 Apple MacBook Pro</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Wait for the 2012 Apple MacBook Pro to be released.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Buy a 2011 Apple MacBook Air.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>I can’t really recommend that you buy a brand new MBP today as the new 2012 MacBook Pros are probably right around the corner with release dates rumored to be as early as  this fall, but my guess is you’ll see a completely new MacBook Pro in 2012 that offers a new look (kiss the CD player goodbye), less weight with more RAM and SSD solid state drives as standard.</p>

<p>History has showed us over the past decade that January at MacWorld has been the release dates for previous generations of Apple Pro notebook models with a few refreshes in the fall, but my guess is that the MacBook Pros will not been until the new  year in 2012. Apple has just released a brand new Apple iPhone and iPod lineup, and a new iCloud and iOS is in the works this fall as well. They have more than enough products that are current to separate you from your money. The new MBP’s can wait until the new year.</p>

<p>Apple has relied on essentially the same design for their MacBook Pro and yes, they have made improvements in screen technology and thunderbolt parts, but it’s my opinion that the newer MacBook Pro versions will be souped up MacBook Air models.</p>

<p>One thought would be to offer a 13 inch and 15 inch MacBook Pro with faster processors and more RAM than the air models and leave the 17 inch MBP design alone, as this Apple notebook is often used as a desktop replacement  where one may need a CD Drive and all the ports you can muster.</p>

<p>All this to say: If you’re asking  when is a good time to buy  a MacBook Pro, now  is not the time. I would wait and see what the 2012 MacBook Pro models look like before you buy a Mac notebook in 2011. If you need to buy a new Mac notebook today, you might be better off  with the MacBook Air and then replace the Air with the new MacBook Pro from 2012 when the time comes if you feel the need to upgrade.</p>

<p>I do know I will be writing on my 2008 MacBook Pro until I see what Apple has in store for us for 2012. I don’t think that buying a 2011 MacBook Pro is a good deal right now.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2011/10/what-does-4gb-ram-cost/">What Does 4GB RAM Cost?</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p><strong>4GB of RAM has never been cheaper than it is today</strong></p>

<p>The price on memory upgrades, or RAM if  you will changes constantly so rather then tell you what it costs for 4GB of RAM I’d rather show you with a price list of current ram prices for notebook computers. I chose notebooks, because there’s a good chance your next computer will be a notebook computer because the prices on notebook computers keep dropping in price over time.</p>

<p>An example: One of the best selling notebooks currently on sale at Amazon (I like buying my computers from Amazon, they offer quick shipping, and stock everything under the sun so I can place one order and then get on with life.  I don’t have to shop at different computer stores  – one for RAM, and one for the laptop)</p>

<p>Anyway, as an example, you can get into an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005NRNPCK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B005NRNPCK">Asus netbook for about $350</a>, which is  a pretty good deal for a notebook for web browsing and facebooking and  the like. And this particular Asus notebook  allows up to 8GB of RAM, meaning you’ll need to buy 4GB x 2 to fill the two available memory slots this notebook computer has.</p>

<p>Not only is this a pretty good deal on a notebook for under $400, but  also if you add RAM you’ll get a speed increase too Take a look at the  8GB Memory Upgrade Kits for this laptop computer:</p>

<p> </p>

<p>[table id=7 /]</p>

<p>As you can see, 4GB memory modules for 2011 notebooks are pretty cheap, and the 8GB memory upgrade kits save you more money on RAM as they are discounted usually as a memory upgrade kit, as opposed to a memory upgrade module.</p>

<p>If you have been sitting on the fence about a ram upgrade, now is  the best time to buy. In the fifteen years I have been keeping  track of the memory prices, ram has never ever been cheaper. Buy 4GB RAM now and be happy that you saved money and have a smoother and faster computer to boot.</p>

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>**<a href="http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;x=0&amp;ref_=nb_sb_noss&amp;y=0&amp;field-keywords=imac&amp;url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">Cheap Apple iMacs at Amazon.</a><br />
**</p>

<p>I like to shop.</p>

<p>I especially like to shop for stuff I’m interested in be it <a href="http://www.audiogon.com" title="cheap home audio">home audio</a>, <a href="http://dcresource.com" title="camera reviews">photography</a> or my favorite: <a href="http://www.apple.com" title="apple computers">Apple computers</a>. But I also hate to pay full load when I don’t have to. In fact, that’s how ramseeker was born. I read in a forum about how nobody could find a fair price on memory and how Apple charged too much for ram. (they do).</p>

<p>I had seen some great memory prices while surfing the web from Crucial, 18004Memory, etc and  a website was born on helping you get a good deal on Apple Memory.</p>

<p>And I do the same thing for Apple iMacs when I am ready to buy a new Apple computer, and over the years again I have found just like the memory prices, you <strong>can get  a better deal on a new  iMac if you don’t  buy the Apple iMac directly from Apple</strong> as Apple will charge you full list price. Granted, Apple does offer  some deals on refurbished Macs and that’s great but I’m talking about where to buy an iMac cheaper than what Apple charges.</p>

<p>Oddly enough, Apple allows discounts on Apple iMacs from other computer stores and that’s why it’s possible to get a better price on an  iMac at Amazon than it is if you would buy the Apple iMac from Apple. Sometimes Apple will offer rebates and other promotions such as the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/buy-a-mac-for-college-or-university-save-up-to200-and-get-100-at-the-app-store/" title="Buy a Mac for College or University Save up to $200 and Get $100 at the App Store">back to school program</a> recently offered but for the most part when you buy from Apple you’re paying full pop day in and day out.</p>

<p>Deals on Apple iMacs happen all the time and a few stores you should check out for iMac deals I have listed below. Some, such as MacMall will throw in free software such as Parallels to sweeten the deal but also allow you to run windows software on your Apple iMac or  in some cases you can get a free printer with your  new Apple iMac too.  If you spend  an hour searching for the best Apple iMac prices online you could save ten percent or even higher on your new Apple iMac computer purchase.</p>

<p>**Best Apple iMac Stores: **</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957"><strong>Amazon</strong></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-1548159-10899893"><strong>MacMall</strong></a></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10840845">Best Buy</a></strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.jdoqocy.com/click-1548159-10782535"><strong>Adorama</strong></a></p>

<p>These are but a few stores where you can get a better deal on an iMac than paying full price from an Apple iMac. You’re just ordering a box with your credit card so it’s my opinion that as long as the warranty will still be honored in the rare case I do have an iMac problem,  I don’t care where the Apple iMac comes  from.</p>

<p>Now, don’t go thinking you’ll get a half price iMac or anything like that, because you won’t. Apple restricts resellers to display the MAP  (minimum advertised price) on Apple iMacs and that’s why when you shop for an iMac you may see the price displayed at these stores to be the same price as what Apple charges. The only way to get around this restriction is to add the iMac to your shopping cart  (don’t worry, you can remove it later) to see the lowest price from these online stores. It’s a bit confusing and some stores do  a horrible job at explaining how all this works and probably lose sales on Apple products because of it, while other store  do a great job of explaining why you need to add the iMac to your cart to get the best price.</p>

<p>Adding the iMac to a shopping cart is not complicated as it’s just one click and you could save as much as ten percent on a new iMac. Add the freebies places like MacMall add to the iMac deal and your total savings on a brand new iMac could be almost a couple hundred bucks. I think that saving over $100 on a brand new Apple iMac is worth the effort of a half hour or so to do some research on getting the best iMac deal you can find.</p>

<p>Of course, once you buy an iMac, you need to fill it with RAM for the best performance, and if you buy RAM from the cheapest memory stores, you won’t get hosed on a ram upgrade. Whatever you do, don’t buy Apple RAM as its’outrageously overpriced. You can find much better deals on RAM for Apple iMacs  below:</p>

		<div class="post-content"><p> </p>

<p>**The Cheapest Apple Desktop Computer Might be the Best Desktop from Apple in 2011<br />
**<br />
It’s October 2011 as I write this, and this will probably change over time as new computer models could be released before the year’s end and  in time to take advantage of Christmas 2011 sales on computers, there’s a good chance that the computers for sale in 2011 have already been released.</p>

<p><strong>The Best Apple Desktop Computer for 2011. </strong></p>

<p>Earlier this year, when I made this list I would have said that an Apple MacBook Pro or even the Apple iMac would  have been perfect choices for Apple Computers. We haven’t seen a new Mac Pro Model this year at all from Apple so  we can scratch that off the list as it’s my opinion that the 2010 Mac Pros should be discontinued or at least have received a refresh to the lineup  this year.</p>

<p>Before the Apple event yesterday announcing the iPhone 4s, I had hoped  that Apple would bump up  the Mac Pro lineup with new models, but now that the cat’s out of the bag we know that Apple is concentrating on phones and and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;x=0&amp;ref_=nb_sb_noss&amp;y=0&amp;field-keywords=iphone%204s&amp;url=search-alias%3Daps?rh=i:aps,k:ipod touch&amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">iPods</a> in time for the holiday season. A smart move, professionally, but personally I would have liked to see to see a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ZR4M6I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=B003ZR4M6I">new Mac Pro</a> under my tree this year.</p>

<p>The <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004YLCLM6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B004YLCLM6">cheapest Apple Mac</a></strong> might be your best bet for an Apple Desktop computer to buy in 2011, with the 2nd place going to the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004YKXGIK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B004YKXGIK">Apple iMac</a>. A Mac Mini and external monitor may not be as elegant as the Apple iMac with it’s all in one design but it’s possible  you can buy a 21 inch desktop computer cheaper than if you were to opt for the  all in one  Apple iMac Design</p>

<p><strong>Let’s Compare Apple Desktops</strong></p>

<p>The cheapest Apple iMac you can get into is the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004YKXGIK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B004YKXGIK">Apple iMac 21.5 inch model at $1125.00</a> or so from Amazon. The cheapo iMac features a 2.5 GHz Intel i5 Processor, 500GB of hard drive space and 4GB of RAM.</p>

<p>The cheapest Apple computer you can buy, period is the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004YLCLM6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B004YLCLM6">Apple Mac Mini at about $568</a> from Amazon at time of writing. That’s close to half price of the iMac. The specs for the Apple Mac Mini are 2.3GHz, 2GB of RAM and a 500GB hard drive.</p>

<p>You can’t bump the processor speed on the Mac Mini, so based purely on processor speed the Apple iMac wins. But we’re talking .2GHz of speed differences between the two and at double the price of the Mac Mini (without the needed accessories like monitor and keyboard) you have to ask yourself <strong>is the Apple iMac worth it</strong>?</p>

<p>Yes, the iMac features a LCD display the Mac Mini does not have, and a keyboard and mouse are included in the box as well but all of these items can be bought as well as the display.  The ram is a little lighter on the stock Mac Mini too,  so that needs to be rectified, but <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;redirect=true&amp;sort=popular-srp-rank&amp;ref_=sr_nr_n_1&amp;keywords=notebook%20memory%20ddr3&amp;bbn=541966&amp;qid=1317736349&amp;rnid=541966&amp;rh=n%3A172282%2Ck%3Anotebook%20memory%20ddr3%2Cn%3A%21493964%2Cn%3A541966%2Cn%3A193870011&amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">8GB of RAM is so cheap today</a></strong> you should  upgrade the ram regardless of what mac you decide to buy.</p>

<p>Total for a Mac Mini with accessories:</p>

<p>Apple Mac Mini: $568.00</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005DLDO4U/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B005DLDO4U">Apple Keyboard: $69.00<br />
</a><br />
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002TLTGM6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=B002TLTGM6">Apple Magic Mouse: $69.00</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003UVCSZ6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=B003UVCSZ6">21.5 inch Acer Display: $109.00<br />
</a></p>

<p>This gives us a bluetooth mouse and keyboard that are wireless and I chose the best selling 21.5 inch display for this example that’s pretty cheap too, at just over $100. The display may be the deciding factor here. Unless you do a side by side comparison of the two monitors there’s no way to tell which LCD display is preferable, so I went with the cheapest 21.5 inch monitor I could find.</p>

<p>The Total Cost for a Mac Mini and Accessories based on my calculations above comes to $815.00.</p>

<p>Compared to the cheapest iMac Price of $1125, you save a touch over $300 if you buy the Mac Mini over the iMac.</p>

<p>The Pros of the Apple iMac include more ram and a cable free all in one footprint. No monitor cables. The Cons of the Apple iMac is the price. If you’re looking to buy the cheapest Apple computer desktop package then the example above gets you into a current 2011 Apple desktop for under $1000. Well under, in fact.</p>

<p>I’m in the market for a new Desktop Mac and I’m leaning towards the Mac Mini as my next Mac as the speed of the computer matters less and less to me as the computer is waiting for me most of the time now and with the extra savings I could get into a bigger LCD display giving me more screen space, and for the computing I tend to do that’s a bigger deal than having the fastest Apple Computer in 2011.</p>

<p>There’s also the fact that the Mac Mini setup is considerably cheaper than an iMac. $300 buys me a new iPod or gets me close to an iPad or tablet device than if I had bought the Mac Mini. I can live with a cable or two on my desktop for a $300 savings overall.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2011/10/how-to-get-a-crucial-memory-scan/">How To Get a Crucial Memory Scan</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p><img class="alignleft" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41XadRhTtrL._SL500_AA300_.jpg" alt="Crucial 8GB Kit (4GBx2), 204-pin SODIMM, DDR3 PC3-10600 Memory Module (CT2KIT51264BC1339)" width="300" height="300" />One of the easiest ways to upgrade your notebook or desktop computer is with a <strong>**<a href="http://www.jdoqocy.com/click-1548159-5527922">Crucial Memory Scan</a></strong><strong>. The Crucial Memory Scanner is safe to use for both Mac and Windows OS systems and has to be the **<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">easiest way to get the right RAM for your computer</a></strong> that’s guaranteed to work and be compatible without the fear of wondering if the RAM you buy is the right RAM for your notebook or desktop PC.</p>

<p><strong>How The Crucial Memory Scan Works</strong></p>

<p>It can be difficult to figure out what memory you need to buy for your computer. As an example depending on what Apple MacBook Pro model you have or need to ugprade the memory on, you may need either PC5300, PC 1066, or PC 1333Mhz DDR 3 menory upgrades for your MacBook Pro. But how do you know what speed memory upgrade you need to buy? All this goes away with a Crucial Memory Scan and takes only minutes to perform an will not upload or share any files on your computer so you can be assured that your privacy is respected as all this program does is scan for the system information from your computer so that it can help decide on the perfect memory upgrade for your Mac or PC.</p>

<p>To Get started with the Crucial Memory Scanner you need to download the <a href="http://www.jdoqocy.com/click-1548159-5527922">crucial memory scan software</a> and then run the crucial memory software on your PC. There’s a good chance your computer will ask you if you ar e sure you want to run this application as it was downloaded from the internet and the answer is yes as Crucial is a well respected computer company that has no interest in harming your privacy or computer security as they are a business and by offering this free software to scan your computer they will of course, recommend Crucial memory upgrades.</p>

<p>The crucial scanner will even direct you to the correct part number for your computer, or in the case where your computer might be eligible for more than one upgrade the crucial scan will offer a selection of ram upgrades for your Mac or PC.</p>

<p>**Crucial Solid State Hard Drive Recommendations<br />
**</p>

<p>In addition to using the Crucial system scan method to get the right memory for your computer, you can also use the <a>Crucial SSD, or Solid Stat Drive recommendation tool</a> to assist you in finding a solid state drive for your computer in addition to adding more computer memory.</p>

<p>Crucial Solid State Hard Drives are starting to drop in price where they are an affordable computer upgrade. Compared to the price of RAM, the solid state drive still has a way to go before the general public will jump in and accept them but it’s only a matter of time as the hard drive sizes for solid state technology continue to grow and yet the same time drop in price.</p>

<p>Using the Crucial solid state tool to upgrade your hard drive ensures that your computer can accept a solid state hard drive upgrade, as not all computer models are equipped for such without extensive modification or sometimes not at all, so I advise you to be sure you can use or benefit from a solid state hard drive upgrade before you spend your hard earned money only to find a solid state drive is not compatible.</p>

<p>These are just two free tools provided by Crucial Technology free of charge to help you with your computer upgrade needs with the hope that you get a fair deal on memory and solid state hard drives.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2011/09/acer-aspire-4551-notebook-computer-memory-upgrade-prices/">Acer Aspire 4551 Notebook Computer Memory Upgrade Prices</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003NR847I/ref=as_li_ss_til?tag=ramseeker-20&amp;camp=213381&amp;creative=390973&amp;linkCode=as4&amp;creativeASIN=B003NR847I&amp;adid=0BHYSP5P6NCVJF42MG7J&amp;"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2980" title="Acer Aspire 4551 Memory Upgrades" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Screen-Shot-2011-09-27-at-3.26.14-PM.png" alt="Cheapest Acer Aspire 4551 RAM " width="311" height="341" /><br />
</a></p>

<p>The <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003NR847I/ref=as_li_ss_til?tag=ramseeker-20&amp;camp=213381&amp;creative=390973&amp;linkCode=as4&amp;creativeASIN=B003NR847I&amp;adid=0BHYSP5P6NCVJF42MG7J&amp;">Acer Aspire 4551 notebook</a> **is a 2010 notebook model released from Acer and yet despite the fact that the Acer 4551 is a 2010 model when it comes to making this Acer Aspire laptop, the same holds true for this model too – **<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">adding more RAM</a></strong> is the best computing investment  you can  make for Acer notebooks, or any other brand too.</p>

<p>Peformance wise, this Acer offers the perfect mix of  speed and size in my opinion with a 14 inch LED display, AMD Athlon II Dual-core Processor P320(2.1GHz, 1MB L2 Cache) and up to 3.5 inch hours of battery life, if you own this computer notebook from Acer or find one on the used market, than you could do yourself a favor and add more ram.</p>

<p>The good news about the maximum RAM allowed for the Acer 4551 is that adding more RAM won’t kill you pocketbook like adding 16GB of RAM might. Due to the fact that out of the box the Acer 4551 comes with 3GB of RAM installed in the two memory upgrade slots available for ram upgrades  this means that you’ll only need to replace the 1GB memory upgrade module in slot B with with a bigger 2GB RAM upgrade for the Acer 4551.</p>

<p>According to current RAM prices, the <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">RAM upgrade for the Acer 4551</a></strong> should only run you about $29.99 for  a 4GB memory upgrade Kit that consists of two DDR3 1333Mhz 2GB memory modules.</p>

<p><strong>Acer 4551 RAM Prices</strong></p>

<p>[table id=7 /]</p>

<p>As you can see from the memory prices above ram for this Acer notebook is pretty cheap. I recommend you upgrade the Acer 4551 RAM with the identical memory upgrades by buying two new RAM upgrades. It’s not a requirement, but you will have less of a chance of memory errors or other such computing fun and for the price difference between an individual RAM chip and a complete memory upgrade kit you’re better off buying new ram cheap than trying to be cheap.</p>

<p>Some memory upgrade stores will even offer you a trade in for your old RAM or you can sell the memory removed from the Acer 4551 and save even more money on your overall ram upgrade for the Acer 4551 notebook computer.</p>

<p><strong>Acer 4551 Solid State Drives</strong></p>

<p>Now that it’s 2011 there’s another way to improve the speed on your Acer 4551 and that’s by replacing the Acer notebooks’ hard drive with a new solid state drive. Budget SSD Drives can be had for about $100 right now and that’s a big price drop compared to earlier this year where the cost for solid state hard drives was still prohibitive.</p>

<p>The benefit of solid state drives for any Acer notebook is that there’s no moving parts so less chance of hard drive failure and significantly faster startup time and overall performance increase.</p>

<p>For about $100, maybe a litte more **<a href="http://www.dpbolvw.net/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT25664BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT25664BC1339">buy a 4GB RAM Upgrade Kit</a> **and a **<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/best-ssd-hard-drives-for-2011/" title="Best SSD Hard Drives for 2011">64GB SSD Drive</a> **and you have a fast Acer notebook that’s the perfect travel notebook thanks to the 14 inch screen size and lighter weight than other 15 inch notebooks like the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/dell-inspiron-15r-2nd-generation-laptop-memory-upgrades/" title="Dell Inspiron 15R 2nd Generation Laptop Memory Upgrades">Dell Inspiron 15R</a>, for example.</p>

**</p>

<p>I have been waiting for this.<img class="alignleft" src="http://images.crucial.com/images/resources/large/package/204-pinSODIMMDDR3.gif" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></p>

<p>You can now buy** <a href="http://www.kqzyfj.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT102464BF1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT102464BF1339">8GB DDR3 1333MHz sodimms from Crucial Technology</a>** directly and install up to <strong>16GB of Crucial RAM in your MacBook Pro</strong>, Mac Mini, and other PC notebooks that can accept up to 16GB like the MacBook Pro’s Can.</p>

<p>In a way, this isn’t really news and places like <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/owc">OWC</a> and <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/ramjet">RAMJET</a> have offered 16GB ram kits for the 2011 Apple MacBook Pros for sometime. Since February for OWC if I recall, but this is the first I have seen where you can <strong>buy 8GB crucial sodimms for MacBook to max out your Macbook Pro</strong> way past what Apple suggests and for a pretty good price considering Crucial is a name brand memory manufacturer.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, not only are these Crucial 8gb sodimms finally available to buy online, they’re pretty cheap when you compare the prices to the other vendors that offer 16GB MacBook Pro memory upgrade kits:</p>

<p>[table id=1 /]</p>

<p>Is it worth it to spend over $700 on RAM in 2011? That’s up to you, but I don’t know that I would right now unless you <strong>really need all the speed you can possibly get your hands on</strong>. Usually if you’ve got a MacBook Pro you’re a professiona even when you consider the higher price these 8GB sodimms still demand they’re a bargain when you compare the price of ram against your profits. More RAM allows you to work faster, especially if you’re working with image processing or video.</p>

<p>But these <strong><a href="http://www.kqzyfj.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT102464BF1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT102464BF1339">8GB 1333Mhz sodimms from Crucial</a></strong> are still pretty pricey when you compare to the <strong><a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT2KIT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1339">8GB Crucial MacBook Pro Kits</a></strong> that will run you just over $50. (see MacBook Pro Price Chart Above) There are cheaper 8GB upgrades above too in the MacBook Pro Price table but you may want to consider this upgrade over the 8GB option which is considerably cheaper. 4GBx2 DDR3 1333Mhz sodimms are a much better deal than 8GBx2 DDR3 sodimms still in 2011. Who knows what happens in 2012 for ram prices, but my guess is these 8GB Crucial sodimms will drop in price like a stone over the next year, just like the 4GB memory modules did.</p>

<p>Another reason to wait a bit when it comes to upgrading your MacBook Pro to 16GB is that there’s <a href="http://www.macrumors.com" title="macbook pro 2012 rumors">rumors of new 2012 MacBook Pros</a> down the road and you may be better off waiting until the new Apple Pro notebooks are released so you compare your options: Upgrade your 2011 MacBook Pro – or buy a new 2011 MacBook Pro, which might have the option to install even more RAM than the 16GB limit the MBP’s have today.</p>

<p>But if you are ready to <strong><a href="http://www.kqzyfj.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT102464BF1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT102464BF1339">buy 16GB of RAM for MacBook Pros</a></strong>, the <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">Crucial Brand</a></strong> is one of the few brands I can recommend without hesitation.</p>

<p>**<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004XZMA9C/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B004XZMA9C">Save on the Dell Inspiron 15R Notebook</a><br />
**</p>

<p>This particular notebook computer from Dell is the <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/electronics/565108?ie=UTF8&amp;ref_=zg_bs_nav_e_2_541966#?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">best selling notebook computer</a></strong> from Dell and available in quite a few different configurations if you buy from Dell directly, but my advice is to buy the <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004XZMA9C/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B004XZMA9C">cheapest Dell 15R</a></strong> you can find and upgrade the RAM and even the hard drive yourself rather than buying memory direct from the manufacturer, which is going to be more expensive than buying high quality memory and installing it yourself.</p>

<p>The Dell 15R from dell is available in two memory configurations:</p>

<p>Dell Inspiron 15R with 4GB Single Channel DDR3 SDRAM at 1333MHz<br />
Dell Inspiron 15R with 6GB Single Channel DDR3 SDRAM at 1333MHz</p>

<p>The Apple Mac Mini with an Intel Core i5 2.3GHz processor is the <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;redirect=true&amp;ref_=sr_nr_n_0&amp;keywords=apple%20computer&amp;bbn=493964&amp;qid=1314967620&amp;rnid=493964&amp;rh=n%3A172282%2Ck%3Aapple%20computer%2Cn%3A%21493964%2Cn%3A541966#?_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">cheapest Apple computer you can buy</a></strong> and makes a great choice for a student computer or home theater or music server, just two applications the Apple Mac Mini could be used for.</p>

<p>One reason the <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004YLCLM6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B004YLCLM6">Mac Mini is so cheap</a></strong>, is that this is the only Apple computer that doesn’t come shipped with a keyboard, mouse or monitor.

<p>The Apple Mac Mini ships standard from Apple with just 2GB of memory installed in it from Apple (one reason the Mac Mini is so cheap) but using the two available memory slots in the Apple Mac Mini you can install up to 8GB of RAM by adding a <strong>8GB Mac Mini Memory Upgrade Kit</strong> that is priced currently at about $50* you could see an additional 50% or more of a performance upgrade by upgrading the 2011 Apple Mac Mini to the full 8GB of RAM it can recognize.</p>

<p><strong>Where To Buy Mac Mini 2.3 GHz RAM.<br />
**<br />
One store that sells name brand memory for Mac Mini as well as other computer brands is <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial" title="crucial mac mini memory">Crucial Technology</a>, but as I write this the cheapest Mac Mini RAM for the Intel Core i5 2011 version is Corsair memory available **<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002YUF8ZG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=B002YUF8ZG" title="Mac Mini RAM on Sale">on sale at Amazon</a></strong> and beats the Crucial memory price by a fair margin.</p>

<p>With ram prices so cheap for Apple Mac Mini Intel Core i5 2.3 GHz, I fully recommend you go straight to the 8GB maximum memory by filling the two available RAM slots the Mac Mini offers. If you’re really on a tight budget you could buy a 4GB Mac Mini RAM kit instead that still doubles your RAM, but with 8GB of RAM so cheap you’re best to go straight to 8GB of Mac Mini RAM.</p>

<p>Memory Installation on the Apple Mac Mini does not need to be done by a service professional (this wasn’t always the case) and if you follow the <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4432#1">Mac Mini RAM instructions</a> from Apple you will have no problems. The design on the new Mac Mini’s are brilliant as this is one of the only Apple computers you don’t need to use any tools with. The bottom cover on the underside of the Mac Mini twists off like you would a lid on a jar where the the entire RAM modules are easily accessible and with your fingers only you can remove and replace Apple Mac Mini Memory with ease.</p>

<p>The Acer Aspire 1825PT notebook is a 14 inch Acer notebook released in May 2010 and offers a P250 processor running at 2.3GHz with 3GB of RAM installed from the factory with a 320GB hard drive and runs windows 7 as the default operating system. With a sale price in the $500 area this notebook from Acer is a competitive notebook for the price and one of many notebooks available for sale if you’re in the market to buy a new Acer notebook.</p>

<p><strong>Acer Aspire 1825PT Memory Upgrades</strong></p>

<p>This is a relatively new Acer notebook that requires the use of DDR3 1066 SDRAM sodimms and this particular Acer notebook offers two memory upgrade slots and can be upgraded to 8GB by replacing the factory Acer RAM with two 4GB sdram sodimms. An <strong><a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT2KIT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1339">8GB Acer memory upgrade</a></strong> is the cheapest price I have seen in the fifteen years I have been monitoring ram prices and 8GB should cost you less than $50 for 8GB of Acer RAM. This is one of the better deals on RAM upgrades for Acer notebook computers today.</p>

<p>**How To Upgrade Acer Aspire 1825PT<br />
**</p>

<p>Like most Acer notebooks access to the ram upgrades are accessible via a small door or compartment on the bottom of the Acer Aspire 1825. Once you have the notebook batter removed, you can safely remove the door, revealing the ram upgrade slots on your Acer notebook.</p>

<p>Remove the Acer factory RAM upgrades by pulling back the two small tabs that hold the ram upgrades in place and gently pull on the memory module to remove the acer factory memory upgrade. Once both Acer Aspire 1825 memory upgrade slots are free, all you need to do is to reverse this process by adding 2x4GB DDR3 SDRAM sodimms to maximize both the Acer Aspire 1825 Memory and also Performance. You should find that after completing the ram upgrade your Acer notebook will run faster and smoother with the added 8GB of RAM.</p>

<p>The Apple iMac is Apple’s <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;x=0&amp;ref_=nb_sb_noss&amp;y=0&amp;field-keywords=apple%20imac&amp;url=search-alias%3Daps#?_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">Best Selling Apple Desktop</a></strong> and has been for years ever since introduced in the now very dated teal color scheme of the 1990’s with that little and revolutionary at the time, round Apple mouse with just the one button.</p>

<p>But in 2010, one of the best selling Apple iMac models had been the Apple iMac 3.06GHz model and with the fast dual core 3.06GHz Intel i3 processor that features a 256k level 2 cache, for each core and combines a 4GB system cache for both cores this is still a fast and entirely upgradeable Apple iMac despite the fact that it is now discontinued with faster iMacs released in 2011.</p>

<p>But just because you have an older 2010 Apple iMac means you need to upgrade the entire computer and you can increase the speed of your 21.5 inch iMac by <strong>buying and adding more memory</strong> instead.</p>

<p>This particular Apple iMac has a maximum memory allotment of 16GB of iMac Memory, even though Apple ships this iMac with just 4GB of RAM standard. You can quadruple the amount of RAM from 4GB to 16GB with this iMac by removing and replacing the factory installed 4GB configured as two two GB memory modules and replacing the Apple iMac RAM with much bigger 4GB memory modules x 4 to get the maximum benefit 16GB of RAM will provide in the 2010 Apple iMac 3.06GHz.</p>

<p><strong>What Memory Do I Buy for the Apple iMac 3.06GHz?</strong></p>

<p>The <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">4GB DDR2 PC2-5300 memory upgrade kit</a></strong> is a little dated and pretty much any currently shipping and best selling notebook will only accept faster memory upgrades typically running at twice that speed or faster with speeds of 1066Mhz or even 1333Mhz, this is still a very popular memory upgrade to buy, especially if you have an older MacBook or MacBook Pro you need upgrading or want to squeeze a little life out of.</p>

<p>For under $50, this <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">cheap 4GB ddr2 pc5300 notebook memory upgrade</a></strong> is a bargain, especially when you compare what it may cost you to buy a new notebook.

<p>**RAM upgrades Are Cheap<br />
**</p>

<p>RAM Upgrades in 2011 are so cheap right now, I can’t stress enough if you have been on the fence about a ram upgrade, now is the time to buy. 4GB RAM upgrades kits, regardless of what notebook computer you want to install this memory upgrade into have never been cheaper. This memory module kit currently retails for under $50 and that’s half the price you would have paid for a ram upgrade just a few short months ago.</p>

<p>I don’t track ram prices for DDR2 memory any more as I tend to concentrate on the newer and more popular memory, but an example of RAM prices dropping would be that in April an 8GB DDR3 memory upgrade kit would have cost $93.00, and today the cheapest 8GB DDR3 RAM Price can be had for under $40, which should be affordable by anybody looking to upgrade their notebook RAM cheaply in 2011.</p>

<p>This is something I’ve been thinking about, as my current MacBook Pro is a 2.4GHz 2008 model, with a wonkey keyboard that needs to have the delete key fixed as it’s not dead yet but rather loose and to get it fixed looks like it may be more trouble than the MacBook is worth.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>I can still use the MacBook Pro for facebook and web surfing, but for getting some work done where my typing skills are probably the reason for the MacBook Pro’s early keyboard failure, there’s a <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/2011-apple-macbook-pros-announced/" title="2011 Apple MacBook Pros Announced">new MacBook Pro</a></strong> in my future as my current fix has been to just <strong>use the MacBook Pro as a desktop replacement</strong> and change my work habits some. This means I can’t compute from <a href="http://www.starbucks.com" title="best coffee ever">starbucks</a> but this also saves me from my coffee habit too so perhaps this is a good thing as having a broken keyboard on my MacBook Pro actually saves me money over time. Those $5 lattes add up.</p>

<p><strong>Buying a new MacBook Pro in August</strong></p>

<p>The argument for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8"><strong>buying a new MacBook Pro</strong> </a> now would be that I need to have a fast portable notebook from Apple that works and allows for all the portability features a fully functional MacBook Pro would  offer  – like a functional keyboard.  The fact that the new MacBook Pro would offer faster processors, more ram capacity and just overall a nicer computing experience than my current apple notebook should end the argument right then and there.</p>

<p>I can trade in my MacBook Pro or sell it on craiglist or eBay  to offset the cost of the new one.  Someone more patient or technically inclined may be able to fix my keyboard easily and I could use the money from my old MacBook Pro to help pay for the new 2011 MacBook Pro.</p>

<p>Assuming what I end up selling my old MacBook Pro for I may be able to realize a cheap MacBook Pro for about  half  price if I got lucky selling or trading my current notebook and using the funds realized from the sale towards the new Apple MacBook Pro with a fully functioning keyboard.</p>

<p><strong>Wait for the 2012 MacBook Pro</strong></p>

<p>If I can struggle along for a few more months, there’s a very good chance to see a new 2012 MacBook Pro in the new year and it’s my gues the 2012 MacBook Pro release date could be about the same time of the 2011 models were released, which is usually about January or February. These professional Mac notebooks usually see new releases happen in early winter. We only have about 4 months left once back to school starts and since  I’ve been OK with this notebook so far  I bet I can struggle along for the remainder of 2011 with this Mac notebook I already own.</p>

<p>It’s my guess the new 2012 MacBook Pros are going to see a redesign, and not just a speed bump or more RAM. I wouldn’t be surprised if at least one model(the 13 inch?)  is more like a <strong>MacBook Air Pro</strong> rather than just a MacBook Pro. The optical drive is pretty much dead to me now and  thanks to streaming  video and software downloads online I don’t really see much need for it any more.</p>

<p><strong>RAM and  solid state drive prices keep dropping</strong> so I bet by the new year we’ll see a MacBook Pro with a solid  state drive replacing the more traditional drives.  Like most things when <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/what-is-the-best-computer-brand-to-buy/" title="What is the Best Computer Brand to Buy?">buying a new computer</a>, the longer you wait when it comes to technology  the more you seem to get in features in speed for the same money.</p>

<p>Take the new MacBook Air models just released: They are the same cost as the 2010 models but now include much faster processors as well as backlit keyboards too. A nice feature I didn’t think I’d need until I stared to use it. It’s nice to see the keys on your keyboard (and have them work, too)</p>

<p><strong>Buy a 2011 MacBook Air instead</strong></p>

<p>The argument  for buying a new MacBook Air instead is that I could <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref_%3Dsr_nr_p_4_0%26bbn%3D565108%26qid%3D1311873784%26rnid%3D15784691%26rh%3Dn%253A172282%252Cn%253A%2521493964%252Cn%253A541966%252Cn%253A565108%252Cp_4%253AApple%23&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957"><strong>buy a newly released Apple notebook now</strong>,</a> instead of waiting for  the 2012 MacBook Pros to be released. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005CWIN1E/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B005CWIN1E"><strong>MacBook Air</strong> </a> is a small, lightweight notebook from Apple with a much faster computer processor inside, a smoking fast solid state drive and the portability and weight I’ve never seen in an Apple notebook to date.</p>

<p>I might even be tempted to try the <strong>11 inch MacBook Air</strong> and then hook it up to an external display when I need more screen real estate than the small 11 incher offers. This may be the way I end up going because  as as much as my ego would like to think otherwise, I don’t need the ‘Pro’ in the MacBook Pro.  The MacBook Air’s battery life, light weight and faster solid state drive far outweighs slugging around a cd drive I don’t need or use rarely.</p>

<p>As cloud computing matures with the new <a href="http://icloud.com" title="apple icloud">iCloud</a> and other new similar services from Amazon and the like, I don’t think the need for big hard drives for my use  will be such a big deal and also: over time solid state drives will get bigger and cheaper, just like memory upgrades have. Who would have thought that when my current 2008 MacBook Pro was new that you would be able to buy <strong><a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT2KIT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1339">8GB of RAM for about $60</a></strong>? It was unthinkable at the time. ‘</p>

<p><strong>Buy a Mac Mini and  an iPad</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004YLCLM6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B004YLCLM6"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2618" title="How about  a Mac Mini?" alt="Mac Mini as my desktop computer" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screen-Shot-2011-07-28-at-1.32.41-PM.png" width="265" height="159" /></a>As tempting as the new <strong>MacBook Airs</strong> are, there’s still other options such as the <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0047DVWLW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B0047DVWLW">iPad</a></strong>  and the new <strong>2011 Mac Mini’s</strong> to consider too. This is another avenue I could go with as I already have all the <strong>Mac peripherals</strong> –  I could <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004YLCLM6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B004YLCLM6">buy the cheaper Mac Mini</a></strong> for desktop computing use  and <strong>buy the iPad 2</strong> for the portable stuff  like email, web browsing and all those funky apps for sale at the <a href="http://www.apple.com" title="apple app store">App store</a>. The cost for a new Mac Mini and iPad would be pretty close to the price of a new MacBook Air or 13 inch MacBook Pro. One reason I haven’t jumped on the iPad bandwagon as of yet is the fact that  I wonder if I would be able to live with the iPad as a notebook replacement?</p>

<p>I know I can buy iPad accessories and keyboards, but then you may as well buy a MacBook Air that offers a full sized keyboard. The iPad scares me as I need to touch type and the lack of a tactile feel of a real keyboard is an important thing to me. I’ve spent some time with the iPad and it’s fine for sending off 100 words or less in an email but I wonder if I could actually type with one as my one  and only portable computing device?</p>

<p><strong>Which Mac Do I Buy?</strong></p>

<p>Here’s the thing: I don’t need to buy a new Mac today, as much as I’d like to think I do.</p>

<p>I think the answer to this question is to ask yourself: Do you need a new computer today?  Not want – <strong>need</strong>. It’s easy to get sucked in to the Apple marketing machine and make no mistake I’m their biggest fan (or sucker) , but <strong>if you don’t need a new Mac  don’t buy one</strong>.</p>

<p>Use the Mac (or PC even) you already own and spend a fraction on <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="apple upgrades">new upgrades</a> for your <a href="http://www.lowendmac.com" title="lowendmac.com">old Mac</a>, as opposed to replacing it. I have lost thousands of dollars spending money on  Apple computers I didn’t really need. I wanted them, sure. But needed, no. If you can swing it the best thing to do is to upgrade the RAM to the maximum on your Apple computer.</p>

<p>You may find that with a RAM upgrade, you don’t even need to buy a new Apple computer and  I just saved you $1000 or more as  <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="best apple memory upgrades">a memory upgrade for the Mac you already own is the best Apple deal you can buy</a></strong>. And now with the fact that <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/best-ssd-hard-drives-for-2011/" title="Best SSD Hard Drives for 2011"><strong>solid state hard drives are getting cheaper and cheaper</strong> </a>with some starting at under $100 today, it’s quite possible for  under $200 to greatly improve the performance of the computer you already own and have paid for. This is the **best Apple deal you can find today **and is much cheaper than buying a new 2011 computer from Apple.</p>

<p><strong>An 8GB RAM Upgrade does not cost much at all. </strong></p>

<p><strong> </strong>In fact, RAM for the Apple MacBook Pros released in February 2011 has never been cheaper, and if you’re looking to upgrade an older MacBook Pro from 2009 or 2010 – even though the 2011 and 2010 MacBook Pros use different RAM (1333MHz sodimms vs 1066Mhz sodimms) the prices for an upgrade to the MacBook Pro’s maximum could cost you less than $50 if you trade in your old 4GB RAM.</p>

<p><strong>Let’s have a look, shall we?</strong></p>

<p>For a 2011 MacBook Pro, regardless of screen size or cost the ram required is a<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/8GB">n <strong>8GB DDR3 SDRAM sodimm memory upgrade kit</strong>,</a> where most memory stores will happily sell you, (see ram price chart for MacBook Pros below)  but the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/cheapest-ram-upgrades-for-apple-computers-july-25-2011/" title="Cheapest RAM Upgrades for Apple Computers. July 25, 2011">cheapest MacBook Pro RAM</a> currently sits at about $<strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002YUF8ZG/ref=as_li_ss_til?tag=ramseeker-20&amp;camp=213381&amp;creative=390973&amp;linkCode=as4&amp;creativeASIN=B002YUF8ZG&amp;adid=1M72YM31597Z6H77GVMK&amp;">55 for  an 8GB upgrade</a></strong>, quite the price drop from the $90 or so the market demanded for MacBook Pro RAM just a few  months prior to today.</p>

<p>But to max out the memory on your MacBook Pro, you’ll need to replace the 2x2GB memory upgrade modules that shipped standard with your Apple notebook and replace them with 2x4GB memory modules.</p>

<p>This leaves you with an extra 4GB of MacBook Pro RAM, you’re not really sure what to do with, but you have a few options to make the upgrade from 4GB to 8GB even cheaper:</p>

<p><strong>Sell your memory online</strong><br />
<a href="http://www.craigslist.org"> craigslist </a>and <a href="http://www.ebay.com">ebay </a>are great sites to make money from your old RAM, effectively reducing the total cost of your 8GB MacBook Pro RAM upgrade</p>

<p><strong>Trade in your memory </strong><br />
There’s more  than one memory store that will apply your old MacBook Pro RAM  to  the total cost of your 8GB upgrade</p>

<p><strong>Donate your memory</strong> there’s lots of  organizations that will take your memory  donation  where they can sell it and use the proceeds from your old memory to support their cause.  <a href="http://www.salvationarmyusa.org/usn/www_usn_2.nsf">Salvation Army</a> and <a href="http://www.salvationarmyusa.org/usn/www_usn_2.nsf">Goodwill </a>will take memory upgrade donations, or perhaps there’s a school or other way  to help others with your factory, but still perfectly usable 4GB memory upgrade.</p>

<p>To summarize, if you buy RAM for MacBook Pro that’s not only the cheapest it’s ever been (now is the best time to buy Apple Memory) but sell or donate the MacBook Pro’s factory installed memory you should be able to realize a total cost of under $50 for an 8GB MacBook Pro Memory Upgrade</p>

<p> </p>

<p>This 4GB RAM module is compatible with pretty much every Apple computer current in 2011:</p>

<p>MacBook Pro notebook computers requires the use of two of these memory upgrade modules to max out your memory in 2011, and with the iMac, and for all but the cheapest iMac – you’ll need to buy two of these memory modules to add another 8GB of iMac RAM, and with the release of the new Apple Mac Minis, this is another Apple computer that can  use the maximum of 8GB by <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002YU83YO/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=B002YU83YO">buying two of these corsair 4GB RAM modules</a></strong>.</p>

<p>Of course,  there’s numerous notebook manufacturers that recommend the use of ddr3 sodimms for ram upgrades and most notebooks can take 8GB easy so make your windows machine run faster with the maximum ram possible as it’s so so cheap now.</p>

<p>If either saving money on RAM or the corsair brand doesn’t work for you there’s other solutions when it comes to buying 4GB DDR3 notebook memory on sale.</p>

<p>Apple has had some pretty big news this week. New <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26x%3D0%26ref_%3Dnb_sb_noss%26y%3D0%26field-keywords%3Dmacbook%2520air%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps%23&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">MacBook Airs</a>, New Mac OS in the form of Mac OSX Lion, and finally the cheapest Mac you can buy today in the form of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26x%3D0%26ref_%3Dnb_sb_noss%26y%3D0%26field-keywords%3Dmac%2520mini%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps%23&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">Apple Mac Mini</a> computer:</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004YLCLM6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B004YLCLM6">The 2011 Apple Mac Mini is the Cheapest Apple Computer You Can Buy</a></strong></p>

<p>One of the first things I tend to ask when any new model of <a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple computer</a> is introduced is <strong>what kind of RAM does the Mac Mini require</strong>? And, as I had guessed with the speed bump in a processor to Intel Core i5 processors also comes a speed bump in ram speed as well and with the release of this small and cheap computer from Apple the ram speed required is increased from <strong>1066Mhz sodimms to 1333Mhz sodimms</strong>. The maximum RAM on the Mac Minis is 8GB by installing <strong><a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT2KIT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1339">two 4GB DDR3 1333MHz sodimms</a>,</strong> as per Apple although you can buy 16GB Mac Mini RAM it’s not something I suggest at this time mostly due to price: <strong>You could have an entire lineup of Mac Minis for what a 16GB Mac Mini memory upgrade kit will cost you today.</strong></p>

<p>[table id=13 /]</p>

<p>The only currently shipping Mac that requires different memory is the Apple Mac Pro as it uses DDR3 SDRAM DIMMS as opposed to DDR3 SDRAM sodimms usually designed for notebook compouters. If you have more than one current 2011 Apple computer at your home or place of work, it’s quite possible for you to swap out the RAM from both or either the Apple iMac or MacBook Pro because with the release of the Mac Mini, <strong>three out of four Macs all use the exact same memory</strong>.</p>

<p>When the Mac Minis were <a href="http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/mac_mini/index-macmini.html" title="first mac minis">first introduced</a> you really were not supposed to upgrade the RAM on this small desktop as the RAM was hard to get to and would or could void your warranty.</p>

<p>But with the release of the 2011 Apple Mac Mini, that’s all changed (the 2010 Apple Mac Minis were the same too) and ease of memory installation on these cheap desktops is now encouraged and even promoted as a selling feature on the <a href="http://www.apple.com/macmini/" title="apple mac mini">Mac Mini</a> page at Apple. How times have changed.</p>

<p>**A word about Mac Mini RAM Upgrades<br />
**</p>

<p>If you buy memory from Apple for your Apple Mac Mini, you will very likely have no problems with your Mac Mini RAM, not to mention the fact that this makes buying a Mac Mini even easier as you can buy both the memory and computer from the same online store. (not to mention the keyboard, mouse and display too).</p>

<p>What Apple doesn’t tell you is that compared to other name brand memory manufacturers the ram the sell for all Apple products is very expensive. You could argue that of course generic RAM for Mac Mini is going to be the cheaper RAM, but this applies to the brand name memory too. In fact, if you want the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com">cheapest RAM for Mac Mini</a>, regardless of brand I have found it to be from Corsair which is a reputable brand name for Mac Mini RAM. If you have another $300 to spend buy the Apple RAM but if you want to save money on RAM for the Mac Mini you have better choices that will cost you considerably less.</p>

<p>**2.3GHz Apple Mac Mini<br />
**</p>

<p>This is the Mac Mini I’m going to buy in the near future. If you’re like me you already have picked up an external monitor and have an extra keyboard or mouse kicking around so paying extra for all the, um, extras might not make a whole lot of sense and this Mac Mini will do just fine for a lot of us looking to use the Mac Mini as a file server, or even replacement for a new desktop computer.</p>

<p>**Newer Faster Processors<br />
** This is a long time coming this new Mac Mini refresh and even though the 2010 Mac Mini was fast, the second generation Intel i5 and i7 processors change the game and now these small desktops offer the same computing power as some other desktop computers costing more and not offering the advantages of the Apple operating system including the newly released OSX Lion – Apple’s latest and newest operating system that’s included free of charge when you buy the 2.3GHz Mac Mini.</p>

<p>**Connect with Thunderbolt Technology and more<br />
**</p>

<p>I saw this coming. First available with the Apple MacBook Pros it makes complete sense for Apple to include this new technology in the Mac Minis, but for some reason I can’t see or get excited about the thunderbolt port. But I’m not connecting a whole whack of peripherals at one time, and I think for most of us who want to just buy the cheapest Mac they can, this feature could be lost. What’s more important when it comes to ports on the back of the Mac Mini is the 4 USB ports and HDMI port that offers a one cable solution for connecting the Mac Mini to your HDTV. The option of being able to connect two displays to the Mac Mini at the same time makes for a nice touch though and the fact that you can use whatever peripheral you’ve got kicking around and use it with these new Macs offers more value than the thunderbolt stuff at this time.</p>

<p>**More, for less.<br />
**</p>

<p>I could be wrong, but if I recall the MSRP on the 2010 Mac Mini was higher at about $699 so the new Mac Mini’s don’t just offer more speed they also offer a cheaper overall price. The 2.3GHz Mac Mini is the best price you can get on a new Mac today and unless you need portability or need to buy all the apple peripherals, where the savings when you add the 2.3 GHz to the cost of the keyboard, display and mouse might mean a better deal would be to buy the cheap iMac instead as the iMac ships with all the peripherals included right out of the box.</p>

<p>**Faster Graphics.<br />
**<br />
This is important if you’re gaming, editing movies or simply for video playback at home you want to be sure that your graphics card is up to the task when called upon and the fastest computer won’t do you any good if there’s a bottleneck when it comes time to display. According to Apple this won’t be the case thanks to the much faster graphics card on the 2.3GHz Mac Mini as the AMD Radeon HD graphics processor with 256MB of GDDR5 memory packs more punch than ever before with some applications offering twice as fast graphics than the 2010 Mac Mini this computer replaces.</p>

<p>Bluetooth and Wifi are pretty standard fare in 2011 so I don’t think I need to spend too much time with these topics and suffice it to say that the 2011 Mac Mini offers both these technologies</p>

<p>**2.5 GHz Apple Mac Mini<br />
**</p>

<p>Apple offers an even faster Mac Mini for $799, and save for the extra $200 and faster processor: Intel Core i5 2.3GHz vs Intel Core i5 2.5Ghz, more memory (2GB vs 4GB) and a faster video card as the main differences between the two Mac Mini models, there’s not much else to write about the more expensive Mac Mini and if it were my money, I’d save it and buy more RAM and save the difference for your next Mac Mini or future Mac from Apple.</p>

<p><strong>Save Money on the 2011 Apple  Mac Mini</strong></p>

<p>It’s not much, but  if you <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26x%3D0%26ref_%3Dnb_sb_noss%26y%3D0%26field-keywords%3Dmac%2520mini%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps%23&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">buy a Mac Mini at Amazon</a></strong>  you can save over the full MSRP  of  what Apple charges with current savings on new Mac Minis only being $5 or so as these are new machines from Apple, it’s still a savings and worth a mention.</p>

<p>Also, check out MacMall for <strong><a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-1548159-10847025">Mac Mini Bargains</a></strong>, especially if you can live with a 2010 Mac Mini as now is the time to buy a discontinued Mac Mini for even more savings as the discontinued models get liquidated to make room for the faster 2011 Mac Mini models.</p>

<p>It will not cost much at all to <strong><a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT2KIT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1339">buy more ram for your HP notebook</a></strong> at the best price I could find.</p>

<p>In fact, if  you consider that your HP notebook already ships with some  memory that you can sell or  trade your HP notebook upgrade, regardless of model number will cost you less than you think.  Most HP notebook computers manufactured in 2011 are capable of accepting and recognizing 8GB of RAM so why not spend the $50 or so to max out your HP notebook to the maximum performance potential?</p>

<p>One of the <strong>best selling HP notebooks</strong> you can buy today is the HP ProBook 4525 (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0046UY3X0/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=B0046UY3X0">currently on sale at Amazon for under $500</a>) and this notebook allows up to 8GB of RAM, yet only comes shipped with 2GB. Yet, if you replace the stock HP memory for RAM that will allow this ProBook notebook to run faster and  allow you to be more efficient you can get more work done, and the HP ProBook RAM Upgrade is pretty cheap for this notebook too. You’ll need to buy <strong><a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-1548159-10273954?url=http://www.crucial.com/store/affiliateredirect.asp?imodule=CT2KIT51264BC1067&amp;aid=1027395&amp;cid=777292&amp;subid=89&amp;PRS&amp;uscj&amp;cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1067">2x4GB DDR3 1066Mhz sdram sodimms</a> </strong> for this HP notebook, and as there’s only two memory upgrade slots in this HP notebook you’ll need to remove the RAM  installed in the HP ProBook 4525 and replace it with the bigger memory upgrade modules for HP notebooks.</p>

This a faster and more expensive notebook than the probook above (still a great deal on a HP computer though)  and offers <strong>faster 2nd generation processors</strong> than what’s in the HP ProBook. But the same applies to the HP DM4-2070 too, and even though its’ a faster HP computer to begin with, when you add more memory you get a faster computer. This HP notebook computer uses RAM that’s different than the memory above and this time you need to buy <strong><a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT2KIT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1339">8GB DDR3 SDRAM SODIMM</a></strong> notebook computer memory kits running at 1333Mhz. The maximum RAM  for the  DM4-2070 is still the maximum of 8GB (not too many notebooks offer 16GB of RAM, yet) and again you can replace the factory RAM from HP with cheaper and faster HP memory to take this HP notebook model all the way to 8GB.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2011/07/do-the-new-imacs-take-notebook-memory/">Do The New iMacs Take NoteBook Memory?</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>Some stores even claim to have Apple Certified RAM, but it’s a good guess that many of these memory shops really only sell generic RAM that  meets the iMac’s technical requirements for memory upgrades. I’ve found that lately,  and completely opposite of recent  times when the only way you could get cheap iMac RAM would be to buy generic memory for the iMacs, but now in 2011 the <a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT2KIT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1339">brand name memory has dropped  so much in price for that 8GB of iMac RAM</a> can cost just over $50 if you shop around  for some deals on iMac RAM.</p>

<p>In 2011, for the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/new-2011-apple-imac-models-announced/" title="New 2011 Apple iMac Models Announced">iMac models introduced in May</a>, these new desktop computers by Apple use the same <strong><a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT2KIT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1339">1333 Mhz DDR3 sodimms</a></strong> that the Apple MacBook Pros use (current 2011 models) so you could effectively swap out the RAM from your iMac to your MacBook Pro. Why you’d want to do that is beyond me, but yes to upgrade RAM for the new iMacs all you have to do is be sure the memory you want to buy meets the memory requirements as determined by Apple.Yes, they do.</p>

<p>This applies to all four models of the iMacs too – all the way from the cheapest iMac with  the $1199 price tag, to the fastest iMac with a huge and visually stunning  27 inch LCD display. They all require DDR3 1333MHz sodimms, which are essentially notebook memory and the current memory for a lot of notebooks from brands other than Apple such as Dell, HP, Acer, and the like. It’s all the same memory.</p>

<p>Because I do what I do, I  have found some <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com">pretty good prices on iMac memory</a>:</p>

    <h1><a href="/2011/07/what-are-the-disadvantages-of-a-macbook-pro/">What are the Disadvantages of  a MacBook Pro?</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>MacBook Pros aren’t that much better and are even more expensive than the MacBook Air, with the 13  inch MacBook Pro still going  to cost you $1199.oo as your cheapest MacBook Pro option and the price can go up from there – depending on the screen size and configuration you end up with.</p>

<p>But, back to the <strong>MacBook Pro and  the disadvantages it may have</strong>,  and the very first thing that came to mind is that <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I" title="Cheap MacBook Pros ">MacBook Pros are freaking expensive</a></strong>. Even the <strong>cheapest mac you can buy, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013FK9U2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=B0013FK9U2" title="cheapest apple computer">Mac Mini</a></strong> is a $700 purchase, and the cheapest way you can get  into any MacBook of any kind  is with an <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0047DVRQW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=B0047DVRQW">11 inch MacBook Air</a></strong>. Sure, it’s got the cachet that only comes with an Apple product but for what is essentially <strong>Apple’s answer to a netbook</strong>, the $999 sticker price is a <strong>lot more than you’ll pay for a netbook running the windows OS</strong> that will probably run you about $200 or so. Is theI’m an Apple Fan, and have been for some time. In fact,  this site started as just a hobby site. I bought web hosting, taught myself some basic html and have been listing the <strong>best prices on RAM I could find</strong> for close to fifteen years. Not  only <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/macbook-pro-ddr3-1333mhz-memory-upgrade-prices/" title="macbook pro ram">MacBook Pro RAM</a></strong>but also I’ve even managed to <strong>swing a few memory deals for you folks over the years</strong> and some stores offer ram prices that are substantially lower than you could find anywhere else and are heavily discounted just for you.</p>

<p><strong>The cloud doesn’t care about your OS.</strong></p>

<p>When I started this site and  on a Mac of course, (I think it was an Apple IIci if I recall. I’m dating myself) I had to have programs to run and files to edit and the <strong>Apple  operating system was leaps and bounds better than anything Windows</strong> related.</p>

<p>But now in 2011, I work in the  cloud. I’m writing this with a 2008  MacBook for the simple reason I see no reason to upgrade my MacBook Pro at this time with anything better or bigger. And, I can’t  believe I’m going to confess this, but <strong>I could do just fine on a $399 (or less) windows notebook:</strong></p>

<p>The programs I use are:</p>

<p><strong><a href="&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004LCK1GG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B004LCK1GG&quot;">Photoshop Elements</a></strong>for the odd banner or graphics tweak. There’s a windows version too. It costs less if I remember for the windows version too. (but this may have changed)</p>

<p>FTP Program. I use <strong><a href="http://www.panic.com" title="best ftp software">Transmit</a></strong>, and  have for years.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.wordpress.org" title="free blogging software">WordPress</a>, which is a free download.</p>

<p>I’ve been working away on a Windows notebook I bought a few years ago for the past month or so as a test to see if I could handle using a <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fbestsellers%2Felectronics%2F565108%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref_%3Dzg_bs_nav%23&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">much cheaper notebook PC</a></strong> as my one and only computer – and  for the most  part and for my needs (yours may differ) I really don’t notice much of a difference between the two OS’s and my 15 inch HP notebook cost me a fraction of a new MacBook Pro and for what I do, does the trick just fine.</p>

<p>This isn’t to say that the Apple MacBook Pro isn’t really worth it, and I appreciate the way the <strong>Mac OS just works</strong> without  having to fiddle  with operating systems and dll files and viruses and the like, and with twenty years plus of Apple computer use under my belt, it’s  hard to train an old dog new tricks. I still can’t get used to the right click thing with the windows OS, either Vista or Windows 7.</p>

<p>But for the up front savings when you compare a MacBook Pro to a Windows notebook, I wonder: <strong>will my next Mac be a Windows PC?</strong></p>

<p>Dell memory can be a good deal if you know <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="cheapest dell memory">where to shop for memory</a></strong> and like the<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/dell-inspiron-15r-2nd-generation-laptop-memory-upgrades/" title="Dell Inspiron 15R 2nd Generation Laptop Memory Upgrades"> Inspiron 15R 2nd  generation </a>and <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/dell-inspiron-17r-2nd-generation-laptop-memory-upgrades/" title="Dell Inspiron 17R 2nd Generation Laptop Memory Upgrades">17r second  generation models</a>, the higher power dells built for professionals, gamers, or anybody else needing a faster notebook than shat the Inspiron models can offer could do worse than <strong>pick up a Dell XPS 15.</strong></p>

<p>I’ll get this out of the way now. I’m an Apple fan, but over the years as the <strong>PC manufacturers have dropped their prices over and over</strong> to the point where you can pay less than $500 for a well equipped Dell notebook it’s almost hard to justify the cost of a new  Apple MacBook Pro,  when the closest competitor to the MacBook, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004XZMBS2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B004XZMBS2"><strong>Dell XPS 15</strong> </a>will do the job in all but a few cases, will do the job for half the price as we become more and more reliant on cloud computing and less reliant on software or operating system.  <a href="http://www.facebook.com">FaceBook </a>looks pretty much the same on both Mac or PC.</p>

<p>Like all things with computer shopping, you can add software, mice, faster processors and a plethora of other factors to bump up the price of your next Dell, but one  thing you should seriously consider is buying  more memory for your Dell XPS as  this is one powerful windows 7 equipped notebook PC.</p>

<p><img class="size-full wp-image-2445 alignright" title="Cheap Dell XPS 15" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/71-RWyLwXVL._AA1500_.jpg" alt="Best Price on XPS 15" width="500" height="500" /></p>

<p>The <strong>cheapest Dell XPS configuration</strong> ships standard with a fast 2nd generation  processor that features an Intel Core i5 processor  running at 2.0Ghz, and out of the box ships standard with <strong><a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT51264BC1339%22">4GB of factory installed Dell Memory</a></strong>  (an aside: there’s  no such thing as special Dell memory. As long as the memory you buy meets the  Dell XPS 15 memory reqirements , you’re good to go)</p>

<p>But you should really <strong>upgrade your Dell XPS 15 memory</strong> to  the maximum ram possible  for the Dell XPS 15, as that’s an upgrade that is really going  to speed up your Dell XPS computer.</p>

<p>What you don’t want to do is buy the RAM from Dell when you order your Dell XPS. You can  but you will pay for the ram upgrade more  through  Dell than you would elsewhere.  At the  time I write this you can buy  <strong><a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT2KIT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1339">8GB of Dell XPS RAM</a></strong> for about half price elsewhere than if you were buy the RAM directly from Dell when you place the Dell XPS order at Dell.com.</p>

<p>That’s a significant savings on Dell Memory and I keep track of  what’s  going on  with Dell Memory so you can save money when it comes time to <strong>buy Dell XPS 15</strong>.</p>

<p>Ulitmately, the answer would be to upgrade **both ram **and **hard drive for MacBook Pro **at the same time.</p>

<p>It’s best to upgrade both the MacBook Pro RAM and hard drive for the ultimate advantage and to get the <strong>fastest speed out of your MacBook Pro,</strong> regardless of whether you’re interested in upgrading a MBP for a 13 inch, 15 inch and even 17 inch model assuming you didn’t care about budget you could easily afford both a RAM upgrade and hard drive at the same time.</p>

<p>**Upgrade Your MacBook Pro RAM First **</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/macbook-pro-ddr3-1333mhz-memory-upgrade-prices/">MacBook Pro RAM upgrades</a> are cheap and affordable, and a faster hard drive won’t do you any good if you’ve got a bottleneck with RAM and the processor is relying on much slower swap disc when it comes to needing to access data quickly and efficiently. If you’re just browsing the web, and what has become an increasing activity over time, and will only get more and more prevalent as time goes on thanks in part to the release of Apple’s iCloud there’s a good chance you don’t have to upgrade the memory on your Apple pro notebook computer.</p>

<p>But RAM for MacBook Pro in 2011 is the <strong><a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT2KIT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1339">cheapest it’s been in some time</a></strong>, so if you were wondering on when to <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com">buy Apple memory</a>, the time would be now as <strong>prices have never been lower for MacBook ram than right now</strong>. It’s the lowest I have seen ram prices and you can now <strong><a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT2KIT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1339">buy 8GB of MacBook RAM for well under $100</a>.</strong> You can also order 16GB memory but for the time being it’s still too pricey for me to recommend unless you have deep pockets or need the most memory you can install in a MacBook Pro regardless of Cost.</p>

<p>Your MacBook Pro already comes shipped with a fast hard drive installed, and the only way to really upgrade the MacBook Pro hard drive would be to upgrade to a larger sized hard drive that won’t really speed things up, but rather just allow you more space for your files, movies and images.</p>

<p>The best bet for a MacBook Pro hard drive upgrade in 2011 is to convert or swap out the hard drive in your MacBook Pro for a much more dependable and <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/best-ssd-hard-drives-for-2011/" title="Best SSD Hard Drives for 2011">faster solid state hard drive</a>. The downside to this advice is that to get a large SSD hard drive installed in your MacBook Pro you’re looking at big bucks. A 500gb solid state hard isn’t really available yet and even a 250GB solid state hard drive comes with a sticker price of $600, and that is in my opinion still too expensive.</p>

<p>But, if you can live with the smaller hard drive space a <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003NE5JCE/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=B003NE5JCE">64GB solid state hard drive</a></strong> is <strong>cheap and affordable solid state hard drive</strong> and at the time of writing just under $100 too. What you could do, is install your MacBook hard drive in an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref_%3Dnb_sb_ss_c_1_23%26field-keywords%3D500gb%2520solid%2520state%2520drive%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Delectronics%26sprefix%3D500gb%2520solid%2520state%2520drive%23%3Furl%3Dsearch-alias%3Delectronics&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">external hard drive case</a> allowing you the best of both worlds: A fast solid state hard drive for fast startup and access to commonly used files and and with your factory MacBook Pro hard drive installed in an external USB case you now have space for your less often used files or for a backup and you still make good use out of the factory MacBook Pro hard drive.</p>

<p>**Upgrade MacBook Pro Hard Drive and RAM<br />
**</p>

<p>If you really shop around, you can <strong>max out the ram on your MacBook Pro for well under $100</strong> and <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003NE5JCE/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=B003NE5JCE">add a 64GB solid state hard drive</a></strong> for right at the $100 mark. Add a negligible cost for your USB hard drive case and you’ve got the <strong>most ram and a faster hard drive in your MacBook Pro for under $200</strong> (plus taxes, and shipping). If I were to <strong>buy a new MacBook Pro</strong>, or even wanted to <strong>upgrade an older MacBook Pro</strong> this is the route I would go as once you spend the relatively cheap amount of about $200 you are taking full advantage of the technology hidden inside your Apple MacBook Pro notebook computer.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2011/07/what-is-the-best-amount-of-computer-memory/">What is the Best Amount of Computer Memory?</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p><strong>8GB Memory is the <a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT2KIT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1339">most affordable and most popular</a> computer memory upgrade today</strong></p>

<p>The answer to this question changes over the years, and ten years ago 1GB of RAM seemed like an unthinkable  amount of  computer ram to have installed and the price was just as unthinkable with it not uncommon to see RAM upgrades for 1GB  sell for one thousand dollars or more, but in 2011 not only have the memory modules gotten bigger over time, they have also gotten cheaper over time too, which means you spend  less money for more RAM upgrades now than ever before.</p>

<p>The good news for  most computer users is that  <strong>today’s computers ship with enough RAM</strong> to run the installed applications such as Windows 7 or Mac OSX and usually a web browser or two and for some every day computer users who just need to check the  weather and browse facebook then the factory  installed RAM is more than ample of an upgrade as we get closer and  closer to location free computing thanks to being able to work in the cloud.</p>

<p>But for the rest of us who like to get some work done, or play games  or edit videos  – the more RAM you have , the better. <strong>There’s no such thing as having too much RAM.</strong></p>

<p>Out of the box, notebook computers, probably the best selling computer today ship from the factory with 3 or 4GB of RAM already installed but  <strong>most notebooks today can use up to 8GB  of RAM</strong> with a few high powered graphics or business notebooks being able to accept 16GB of RAM, but the average and best selling ram upgrade is th<strong>e <a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT2KIT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1339">8GB DDR3 SDRAM memory upgrade kit</a></strong>.</p>

<p><strong>8GB of RAM for desktop or notebooks in 2011</strong> is the current sweet spot for memory upgrades. 4GB ram, while cheaper than 8GB obviously doesn’t double the RAM in your computer which is what you’re trying to do when you’re ready to buy RAM and 16GB RAM isn’t priced affordably enough yet to make the cost worthwhile for all but a few power users or early adapters to the bigger 8GB memory sodimms that are required as most notebooks can’t hold more than two memory upgrade modules at  a time.</p>

<p><strong>8GB Memory Prices</strong></p>

<p><strong>8GB DDR3 sodimms</strong> are the best selling and  most popular memory upgrade to date for computers, especially notebook and laptop computers</p>

    <h1><a href="/2011/06/apple-imac-27-inch-3-1ghz-memory-upgrades/">Apple iMac 27 inch 3.1GHz Memory Upgrades</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>The difference between this model of iMac and the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/apple-imac-intel-core-i5-2-7ghz-27-inch-memory-upgrades/" title="Apple iMac Intel Core i5 2.7GHz 27 inch Memory Upgrades">cheaper 2.7GHz model</a>, asides from the $300 discount is the faster video card  with more RAM: 1GB vs 512mb as what comes standard on all other Apple iMac models, resulting in faster video performance which is  more important for gaming than surfing <a href="http://www.facebook.com">facebook</a>. And if you buy the fast iMac from Apple directly you can configure this Apple iMac with even a faster processor running at  3.4Gz,  but in the  stock configuration you can <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004YLCE2S/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B004YLCE2S">buy the  3.1GHz</a></strong> is the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/new-2011-apple-imac-models-announced/" title="fastest apple iMac in 2011">fastest iMac that you can buy today from Apple</a>. All else pretty much the same. Apple offers a bigger hard drive option at 2TB, but you can upgrade the hard  drive for any iMac pretty easily so that’s not much of a feature, although if you are working in video or using large files like photoshop files or movies you can never have enough hard drive space, (or RAM, too)This specific <a href="http://www.apple.com/imac/" title="apple imac">Apple iMac</a> model is the <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004YLCE2S/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B004YLCE2S">fastest Apple iMac you can buy</a></strong> and also offers the biggest LCD display as well. Simply put, if you’re in the market for an Apple iMac and need the <strong>biggest and baddest Apple consumer desktop computer you can buy</strong>, then look no further than the Apple iMac 27 inch model running at 3.1 GHz.</p>

<p><strong>Is the faster 27 inch iMac worth it?</strong></p>

<p>I have already noted that I think the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/apple-imac-21-5-inch-2-7-ghz-memory-upgrades/" title="Apple iMac 21.5 inch 2.7 GHz Memory Upgrades">Apple iMac 21.5 inch </a>is the best deal out of the two 2011 21.5 inch Apple iMacs, but if you can afford the extra $500 from the price of this Apple iMac, than the <strong>extra screen real estate from 21.5  inches  to 27 inches is quite the jump</strong>, and probably will allow you to get more work done than the processor upgrade from 2.7Ghz to 3.1. GHz. If you are deciding on what iMac to buy, the 27 inch  2.7 GHz model might be the best deal just based on the fact of screen size alone.</p>

<p>I always like to <strong>compare prices of computers</strong>, where in 2011 more than ever there’s a good chance you can make money with your computer than ever before. Maybe you freelance in photography or writing and any money you make on the side could be used towards paying for your new iMac. The one good thing about Apple computers is that they tend  to hold their life well and unless you need the latest and greatest computer you can buy, <strong>an iMac should last you about 3 years or so</strong>. I’m writing this on a 2008 MacBook Pro that has paid  for itself over and over the past three years and for the work I do, I see no reason for an upgrade.</p>

<p>Assuming you get 3 years out of your iMac, which is quite possible and if you <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004R6J2KW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B004R6J2KW">add AppleCare for your iMac</a></strong> you’ve got a trouble free Mac desktop with full warranty, the 2.7 Ghz works out to costing $47.00 monthly, and the stock iMac 3.1 GHz works out a few dollars more at $55.00 – About eight dollars a month more.  $55 a month, and the  fastest iMac is paid  for. Less,  if you find a way to make more money with your computer. It’s quite possible to earn a living with your Mac, and as you see the <strong>price difference between the 2.7GHz and 3.1GHz Apple iMacs</strong>, when broken down over the three years is negligible.</p>

<p><strong>Adding more RAM to the iMac 3.1GHz</strong></p>

<p>[table id=2 /]</p>

<p>Out of the box, the Apple iMac 3.1 GHz comes from Apple shipped with just <strong>8GB of RAM</strong>, which for light computer use  like checking your email, or booking a vacation, or some other rather processor light task or if you just want  to use the included iApps like iTunes and iPhoto and the like, then the 8GB of factory supplied RAM will probably do you.</p>

<p>But if you’ve bought 2 grand worth of iMac to get the <strong>fastest iMac you can buy</strong> this year, you either need the added screen real estate a 27 inch iMac offers, or even more likely, you <strong>need the processor speed **and the cheapest way to upgrade your iMac processor is to add more memory to your Apple 3.1 GHz iMac. And as long as you  don’t **<a href="http://store.apple.com/us/memorymodel/ME_IMAC_S11_21">buy RAM from Apple</a></strong>, you can upgrade the iMac to the full 16GB of RAM for less than $100. Actually, as I write this in the summer of 2011, less than $70 for another 8GB of  iMac RAM is quite possible.</p>

<p>Once you’ve decided to buy more iMac RAM and fill the fastest iMac with as much RAM as possible, you need to buy another <strong>8GB of DDR3 1333Mhz SDRAM sodimms</strong>. There was once  a time when Apple computers were much more fussy about the memory requirements and  you needed to buy memory for specifically for Apple computers but for now those days are behind us and  as long as  you buy quality memory upgrades from memory stores you can trust, with the right memory specifications  you will have no problems when installing memory in this Apple computer or any other, either.</p>

<p><strong>How to Install iMac 3.1 GHz 27 inch  Memory  Upgrades</strong></p>

<p>Apple computer can show you to <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1423">install iMac RAM </a>much  better than I can, but essentially you need to place the  iMac face down on your desk (I suggest  a soft blanket  or towel so you don’t scratch that big beautiful lcd display)  and  remove the door to access the four iMac memory upgrade slots on the bottom of the iMac. There’s four slots available for memory upgrades, and two of them are going to be empty and just waiting for you to add two more <strong><a href="http://www.dpbolvw.net/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT51264BC1339">4GB DDR3 SDRAM 1333Mhz sodimms</a></strong>, or  if you prefer, an <strong><a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT2KIT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1339">8GB Apple iMac memory</a></strong> upgrade kit that bundles two 4GB DDR3 for iMac together.</p>

<p>One thing you do have to be careful about when installing memory upgrades is static electricity. If you wish to be real careful you can add an anti static strap to your memory order when <strong>buying  iMac RAM</strong> but it’s really not needed if you’re careful to ground yourself, which is done by touching metal on the iMac before you touch the memory upgrade for iMacs, as the static electricity  can damage your memory upgrade.</p>

<p>I’ve already written about <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/apple-imac-21-5-inch-2-5ghz-memory-upgrades/" title="Apple iMac 21.5 Inch 2.5Ghz Memory Upgrades">memory</a> for the <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004YKXGIK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B004YKXGIK">cheapest iMac </a> </strong><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004YKXGIK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B004YKXGIK">on sale</a></strong>in 2011, and  the next iMac upgrade from that one, the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/apple-imac-21-5-inch-2-7-ghz-memory-upgrades/" title="Apple iMac 21.5 inch 2.7 GHz Memory Upgrades">21.5  inch 2.7 GHz model</a>, that when you <strong>compare the two 21.5 inch iMacs</strong> the latter comes out ahead even though it does cost more money initially.  But the game changes with this  27 inch iMac becuase  now we’re into the <strong>big screen iMac memory upgrades</strong> and  when it comes to <strong>adding more RAM to a 27 inch iMac in 2011</strong> this biggest and cheapest iMac you can buy today this cheap, yet big screen iMac might  just offer the best bang for the buck for Apple consumer desktop models available on sale today.</p>

<p><strong>27 inch Intel Core i5 Technical Specs</strong></p>

<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2281" title="Free RAM for 27 inch iMac" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Screen-shot-2011-06-22-at-11.57.15-AM.png" alt="How to get iMac RAM FREE" width="633" height="494" /></p>

<p>Technically, the low end, big screen iMac is exactly the same as the higher end 21.5 inch model. Same speed Intel Core i5 processor, same maximum memory at 16GB, same  video card, same 1TB hard drive, and of course the new <a href="http://www.apple.com/imac/specs.html">2011 iMac features</a> such as thunderbolt technology, facetime,  and all the rest. <strong>You do get a few more connection options when you compare the 21.5 inch iMacs to the 27 inch models</strong>, as the big screen iMac offers one more thunderbolt connector than the  smaller imac does, but for the <strong>price difference between the $1499 21.5 inch iMac and the $1699 27 inch Apple iMac</strong>, the reason for the $200 premium is  the much larger screen the 27 inch iMac display offers.</p>

<p><strong>Which iMac to Buy?</strong></p>

<p>If you’e on a budget then <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004YKXGIK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B004YKXGIK">buy the cheapest iMac you can</a></strong> which, if you buy from Amazon or <a href="http://www.kqzyfj.com/click-1548159-10894596">MacMall</a>,you’ll save over what is available and on sale  at the Apple Store. And I’ve already explained that the <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/apple-imac-21-5-inch-2-7-ghz-memory-upgrades/" title="Apple iMac 21.5 inch 2.7 GHz Memory Upgrades">faster 21.5 inch iMac is better value long term</a></strong> but if it were me, and especially if  I made a living from the iMac, even part time – the difference in price between a 2.7Ghz 21.5 inch, and a 2.7GHz 27 inch is just $200 more. Over a year, <strong>that price difference works out to be just pennies a day</strong> – about .50 or a bit more.</p>

<p><strong>Bigger  Screen =  Faster iMac</strong></p>

<p>This is something that can get overlooked. I’m just recently back from a week away working with a borrowed MacBook Air, and as light and awesome as the MacBook Air, there’s something to be said for more screen real estate. With a <strong>bigger screen, you can have more windows open, and work more efficiently</strong>,  and if you’ve got the need for either lots of toolbars or browser windows open, a big screen on your iMac is worth way more than the pennies a day  more it costs when  compared to the faster, but smaller sized display on the Apple iMac 21.5 inch model</p>

<p><strong>iMac Intel Core i5 2.7GHz 27 inch Memory Upgrades</strong></p>

<p>Now that we’ve determined that when compared to the 21 inch iMacs, this particular iMac is the <strong>best deal across the entire iMac lineup</strong> I wan to talk about RAM upgrades. When you consider the cost of the iMac at $1699, and the cheapest RAM upgrade for the iMac hovers around $75 mark currently, you can get the <strong>fastest and biggest iMac on sale  if you shop carefully</strong>, get free ram for the iMac 27 inch too.</p>

<p>Let me explain:</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.apple.com/imac/specs.html">iMac 27 inch costs $1699 at the Apple Store</a>, and another 8GB of RAM at the Apple Store costs a whopping $400. <strong>Total cost for a 27 inch iMac full of RAM =$2099.00</strong></p>

<p>But if you <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004YLCBRG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B004YLCBRG">buy the 27 inch iMac at Amazon</a></strong>, you’ll save about $80 off the 1699.99 regular retail price. And the <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002YUF8ZG/ref=as_li_ss_til?tag=ramseeker-20&amp;camp=213381&amp;creative=390973&amp;linkCode=as4&amp;creativeASIN=B002YUF8ZG&amp;adid=1M72YM31597Z6H77GVMK&amp;">cheapest iMac RAM you can buy</a></strong> is also priced less than that discount , at about $75, so if you <strong>buy both the iMac and RAM at Amazon</strong> your total is still less than $1699, by about five dollars so the <strong>total cost to upgrade your new Apple iMac to the maximum 16GB RAM is essentially FREE</strong>. A ram upgrade that costs you nothing is the cheapest ram you’ll ever see.</p>

<p><strong>Where to Buy 27 inch Apple iMac RAM</strong></p>

<p>Of course my logic and math on getting <strong>iMac RAM for FREE</strong> only applies if you are ready to buy a new iMac today and apply the Amazon discount to the RAM Upgrades. If you already have a 27 inch Apple iMac and are <strong>considering a ram upgrade to the maximum of 16GB</strong> you can still do so, and still save enough money on RAM when compared to Apple to <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0039SM0AS/ref=as_li_ss_til?tag=ramseeker-20&amp;camp=213381&amp;creative=390973&amp;linkCode=as4&amp;creativeASIN=B0039SM0AS&amp;adid=1C309EX3ASWHZ876FEXY&amp;">buy yourself a SSD hard drive,</a></strong> which after memory upgrades might be the <strong>best performance enhancement for your Apple desktop computer</strong> as the solid  state hard drives are <strong>much faster than traditional hard  drives</strong> for Apple computer and offer much faster performance when you compare the two.</p>

<p>Below is a current price list of where to buy  RAM for the 2011 Apple iMacs, and as you can see the <strong>iMac ram prices are much cheaper</strong> than the RAM prices from Apple directly.</p>

<p>Let’s fast forward say, 3 years to 2014. <strong>8GB of iMac RAM **is laughable as all Macs now ship standard at 32GB as the minimum ram you can get installed in any Apple computer. But, if you bought this Apple iMac model over the cheaper one, filled your iMac with another 8GB and are now running at the maximum ram allowable for 2011 iMacs, you’re **now at 16GB of RAM</strong> and you can now forget about buying a new desktop for sometime as you now have <strong>16GB iMac RAM</strong>. Although when compared to 2014 computers this will seem like a paltry amount, the 16GB iMac has served you well for at least three years.</p>

<p>Assuming you pay full retail. (which you won’t, because you’re smart) and add another <strong>8GB of iMac RAM</strong> you’re now at 16GB and $1600 for your iMac. $1600/36 = $44 a month to use this iMac worry free for the next three years. For about the same price as a cheap cup of coffee a day you can <strong>buy this iMac, fill it with RAM</strong> and never have to worry about a new computer again.</p>

<p>I’ve done this with a MacBook Pro: I filled it with RAM and forgot about it. I use this 2008 MacBook Pro every day and only now, due to crummy battery life and some keyboard issues am I considering replacing my MacBook Pro with a new model. Again, I’ll research which mac to buy (or maybe even a PC, dare I say)  determine what computer best meets my needs  and then fill that mac with as much RAM as I can (assuming the RAM is affordable)</p>

<p>My point is this: At first glance, the <strong>cheapest iMac might be considered a better deal</strong> when you compare the iMac to more expensive iMacs. But if you decide you need a new iMac this particular iMac model might just be considered the <strong>cheapest iMac overall</strong> when you total the cost and consider that the 2.7GHz can take more RAM, and that RAM can be bought for as little as $100, or even much less.</p>

<p>I won’t write about all the wonderful features of the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/new-2011-apple-imac-models-announced/" title="New 2011 Apple iMac Models Announced">newest 2011 iMacs</a> as I’ve kindof done that already, but I did want to point out that this particular Apple iMac, due to the fact that it’s the cheapest 2011 iMac that can take 16GB, the 2.5Ghz might be the best of the bunch despite the fact that the initial cash outlay may be more initially.</p>

<p>The Apple iMac 21.5 inch 2.5Ghz model released  in May 2011 is the **<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004YKXGIK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B004YKXGIK">cheapest Apple iMac</a> **you can buy in 2011.</p>

<p>Offering a fast 2.5GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i5 processor with 6MB  of on chip shared L3 cache, a gorgeous 1920×1080 LCD display, 4GB of memory as the factory default Apple iMac memory configuration, 500MB of hard drive space and AMD Radeon HD6750 video card –  the newest and least expensive iMac aimed at the consumer or  home office or student  user offers a fantastic computing value and ease of use other PC manufacturers  have tried but failed to duplicate but with  fail.</p>

<p><img class="size-full wp-image-2265 alignnone" title="Apple iMac Deal" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Screen-shot-2011-06-20-at-4.51.17-PM.png" alt="Best iMac Price" width="490" height="397" /></p>

<p><strong>Video</strong></p>

<p>New on the 2011 Apple iMac 21.5 inch 2.5Ghz  when compared to later or earlier iMacs is the Facetime HD  web camera and the ability to support an external monitor up to 30 inches and yet still use the iMac display as well, totaling over 50 inches of screen real estate, a perfect match for video editing or working with photography where big screens are needed for at a glance menu and toolbar selection.</p>

<p><strong>Sound</strong></p>

<p>When using Apple iTunes or any other compatible video or MP3 player (iTunes ships free with all iMac models) the sound is provided through stereo  17 watt loudspeakers and multiple ports are also inlcluded for both analog and digital audio requirements.</p>

<p>**Connections **</p>

<p>The Apple iMac offers very versatile  connection options  with all connectors placed on the rear of  the 21.5 inch iMac to compliment the clean Apple iMac design and getting unsightly cables hidden out of plain sight. One thunderbolt connector (there’s 2 thunderbolt connector on every other 2011 Apple iMac so you may want to consider a more expensive iMac if  the thunderbolt  technology is now, or will be important to your computing needs).</p>

<p>The mini display port offers connection options for both VGA and DVI options,  but as the connectors are specific to Apple computers, the iMac accessories can be considered expensive when compared to more standard VGA connections on your standard desktop PC’s.</p>

<p>One firwire 800 port is included on the iMac, but  over time you will find that as the Thunderbolt technolgy improves that it’s my guess firewire will not be included on future Apple iMac  models.</p>

<p><strong>Wireless Keyboard and Mouse</strong></p>

<p>One  of the nicest features on the new 2011 Apple iMacs is the fact that using the included bluetooth technology you’re now free of wires when using the the cheap iMac and this fact makes the  cheap iMac a much more attractive solution for home computing as some kitchens now include a little nook or small desk for a TV or computer and the iMac would make a very attractive wire-free computer for home use.</p>

<p><strong>Size and Weight</strong></p>

<p>Height: 17.75 inches (45.1 cm)<br />
Width: 20.8 inches (52.8 cm)<br />
Depth: 7.42 inches (18.85 cm)<br />
Weight: 20.5 pounds (9.3 kg)3</p>

<p>At 20lbs, the Apple iMac 21.5 inch is not light and in no way match a ultra portable computer such as the MacBook Air, but thanks to it’s sleek design with cable free technology you could move it simply and easily if you needed periodically move the Apple iMac.</p>

<p><strong>Warranty</strong><br />
This iMac model, like all Apple computers, comes standard with 90 days of telephone support to get you up and running with your new iMac and a one year limited warranty is included with the Apple iMac too. There is an extended warranty you can buy for the iMac, but as the iMac is not a portable in any sense of the word, I don’t think an extended warranty is really needed for this affordable Apple desktop. At just over $1000 for the computer itself, it makes no sense to add another cost to the AppleCare warranty which even on sale costs over $100, and unless you use the iMac in some extremely dirty or dusty environments I feel it’s better to save the $150 and apply it to more memory upgrades.</p>

<p>**Apple iMac 21.5 inch 2.5GHz Memory Upgrades<br />
**</p>

<p>The Apple iMac 21.5 inch 2.5Ghz model is the only model in the 2011 Apple lineup that only allows for a 8GB RAM maximum and all other faster iMacs (and more expensive too) wil accept 16GB of iMac DDR3 1333Mhz RAM. The good news is if you’re upgrading from the 2010 Apple iMac lineup, you can use and swap out the RAM from your old iMac to new.</p>

<p>If you’re buying an iMac 21.5 inch 2.5GHz, you need to add more iMac RAM to the cheapest iMac in Apple’s iMac lineup. From the factory, this sleek consumer Mac ships with 4GB of RAM (2x2GB sdram dimms), but you should double the RAM to 8GB for maximum performance. Not too long ago, 8GB of iMac RAM would cost you as much as the computer itself, but ove time iMac RAM prices have really dropped and you now can fill this affordable iMac with all the RAM it can handle for the cost of a dinner and a movie.</p>

<p>You could do just fine with running 4GB of iMac RAM, and for some of you 4GB might be all the RAM you need, but as we enter the second half of the year, 8GB of RAM is so cheap for this computer it really is very good money spent on your computer, and in some instances better than adding more hard drive space to your iMac (you should have an external hard drive for backup) or even buying software as a lot of software you can get for free or work ‘in the cloud’ where you don’t really need an application on your iMac above and beyond what’s included with the iMac at the store, such as iTunes and iPhoto, programs that allow you to organize your photos and music on your iMac.</p>

Offering quad core speed, these beautiful desktops are affordable and in some cases, when you add more RAM and a solid state drive to an iMac, faster than an Apple Mac Pro.</p>

<p><strong>June 2012 Update:</strong> This year in 2012 Apple offers a <strong>pretty good deal for back to school purchases</strong> from the <a href="http://store.apple.com/us/browse/campaigns/back_to_school">Apple Store</a>.</p>

<p>When you purchase a Mac between June 11, 2012 and September 21, 2012  you’ll also get a $100 back to school gift card for use for Apps, Books, Movies or Music.</p>

<p>When you purchase an iPad between June 11, 2012 and September 21, 2012 you’re eligible for a $50 Back To School Gift Card</p>

<p>This back to school gift card offer is in addition to any Apple Education discounts you may be eligible for. Faculty and staff members from any grade level are also available for a discount.</p>

<p><strong>Apple Education Discount Qualifications</strong></p>

<p>To be eligible for an education discount from Apple you need to be a college student, a student accepted to a college or a parent buying a Mac or an iPad on behalf of a student for the upcoming year.</p>

<p>2012 Apple Education Discounts</p>

<p>Save up  to $200 of a MacBook Pro</p>

<p>Save up to $50 off a MacBook Air</p>

<p>Save up to $100 off an iMac</p>

<p>Interestingly, there is no discount for buying an iPad, but you still are entitled to the discount.</p>

<p>Overall, these are pretty good discounts and if you include the gift cards in the back to school promotions  from Apple this year you could save up to $200 and get a 100 dollar gift card – that’s a discount of  $300 when compared to buying  your Mac at tull price from the Apple Store.</p>

<hr />

<p>The <a href="http://store.apple.com/us/browse/campaigns/back_to_school?aid=www-naus-bts2011-0526-14" title="summer back to school apple deal">summer deal on Apple Mac Computers for Students</a>, in my opinion this year isn’t half as good or enticing as it has been in previous years where you could <strong>buy a Mac and get a free iPod</strong> which would make for a more logical deal than this year’s offering that sees Apple promoting their App Store more than their iPod lineup.</p>

<p>The good news with this is that on <a href="http://store.apple.com/us/browse/campaigns/back_to_school?aid=www-naus-bts2011-0526-14">select Macs you can save up to $200</a> with educational prices being offered <strong>AND you get $100 worth of software to start the school year off with</strong> from Apple’s relatively new App Store, which might be a better deal for your pocketbook in the long term than in past years where you got an iPod for free.</p>

<p>MacBooks are available <strong>starting at $899</strong>, <strong>MacBook Pro’s at $1099</strong>, <strong>MacBook Airs at  $949 **and **iMacs at $1149</strong> which works out to the following discounts before you add the $100 App Store credit:</p>

<p><strong>MacBook : $100 savings</strong></p>

<p><strong>MacBook Pro: up to $200 savings</strong></p>

<p>**MacBook Air: save $50 **</p>

<p>**iMac: Save $100 **</p>

<p>One interesting  thing I noted with this deal is that the <strong>Mac Mini, Apple’s cheapest Mac</strong> isn’t listed, but I find  odd, considering students don’t have a lot of money to buy Apple computers  I thought that this would be one of the first choices for students entering college, as it ‘s currently  the cheapest Apple computer you can buy. Also, the only desktop available is the iMac. You don’t get educational pricing with this deal on the Mac Pro it seems.</p>

<p>RAM for all these computers cost a lot more money at Apple (<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/macbook-pro-ddr3-1333mhz-memory-upgrade-prices/">see MacBook Pro RAM Prices for example</a>) and you’re much better off if you <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="buy ram">buy RAM</a> for much less with all the money you saved, and in the case of the MacBook Pro, you could <a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT2KIT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1339"><strong>fill the notebook with much cheaper RAM</strong>,</a> and <strong>still have $100 in your pocket plus the App Store credit</strong> too if you <strong>buy RAM for the MacBook Pros</strong> that works just as well and is at the time I write this – over $300 cheaper than the memory  from the Apple Store. You might not get a <strong>free iPod</strong> as you may have in recent years, but you still could end up with what essentially could be a <strong>free RAM Upgrade</strong> for your back to school notebook computer, $100 in your pocket, and a $100 credit from the App Store too.</p>

</p>

<p>The** <a href="http://www.kqzyfj.com/click-1548159-10715248">Dell Inspiron 17R 2nd Generation starts at just $599 when you buy direct from Dell,</a>** and yet for  some reason it’s priced much  higher at Amazon where you can still buy a Dell 17inch Inspiron but it will cost you either $200 or $100 more</p>

<p><strong>Best RAM for Dell Inspiron</strong></p>

<p><strong>Inspiron 17R 2nd Gen Review</strong><br />
The <strong>second generation of Dells</strong> use either <strong>intel i3, Intel i5, or Intel i7 processors</strong> and depending on what processor you chose when configuring your big screen notebook, the cost may be higher than the  <strong>$599 price advertised **when you buy from Dell directly as this model features **second generation i3 processors</strong> which aren’t the fastest processor intel makes but is perfect for light computing duty such as email or web browsing. But if you’re working with a <strong>17 inch notebook</strong> there’s a good chance you you’ll be working with audio, video or other processor heavy tasks that require more speed and more importantly, <strong>more RAM</strong>.<img class="size-full wp-image-2234 alignnone" title="Cheapest Dell Inspiron 17R" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Screen-shot-2011-06-16-at-1.41.15-PM.png" alt="Deal on Dell Inspiron 17R " width="575" height="476" /></p>

<p>Out of the box, the <strong>cheapest 17 inch Dell notebook</strong> uses <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/best-prices-for-notebook-memory-ddr3-1333mhz-204-pin-sodimms/" title="Best Prices for Notebook Memory: DDR3 1333Mhz 204 Pin SODIMMS">DDR3 1333Mhz SDRAM</a> sodimms that out of the box ships with <strong>4GB of memory uprades already installed,</strong> which in mid-2011 is a useable amount  of RAM and for some who’s main computing task is <a href="http://www.facebook.com">facebook</a> the <strong>4GB DDR3</strong> just might do you fine without any need to buy Dell memory upgrades for this 17 inch notebook aimed at the home and  home office market</p>

<p>But as I mentioned when I wrote about the smaller version of this dell inspiron model – the <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/dell-inspiron-15r-2nd-generation-laptop-memory-upgrades/" title="best dell 15 inch notebook">Dell Inspiron 15R 2nd generation</a></strong> notebook, and especially if you’ve got the big screen Dell, you’re either gaming or doing serious work on this Dell computer and **you’re going to need as much RAM as possible **to max out the Dell Inspiron 17R with RAM upgrades for a computer that could see a 50% speed increase all by adding $100 (<a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT2KIT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1339">much less actually</a>) of RAM.</p>

<p>To <strong>max out the RAM on the Dell Inspiron 17R **you need to remove the factory RAM (which you can sell online for  even more savings on memory. Try craigslist or eBay for selling you  factory installed Dell memory upgrades) and install bigger ram modules. Depending on your ram configuration, you could see either **2x2GB memory upgrades in your Dell</strong>, or in some cases 1x2GB and 1x4GB ram upgrades. If you bought a Dell Inspiron 17R second generation you can stop reading now as you now have the fastest Dell notebook (or at least all the RAM the Dell can handle). For the rest of you, keep reading:</p>

<p><strong>Dell Inspiron 17R 2nd generation memory  upgrade installation</strong></p>

<p>Upgrading the ram on this <strong>big screen beauty from Dell</strong> couldn’t be easier. Flip  the notebook over, remove the battery and be sure you’re <strong>free of any static electricity</strong> as static is a RAM killer. You’re dealing with a <strong>very expensive piece of electronics here</strong>, and  <strong>installing Dell memory is easy</strong> but you do need to be sure you’re installing  RAM so you don’t fry your Dell or void the warranty. If you have any apprehension about <strong>installing the memory yourself</strong> you should take your Dell and your RAM to an authorized service center for Dell. Best Buy might be one place you can take your Dell for ram installation services.</p>

<p>But you really shouldn’t have to take the Dell anywhere to get RAM installed. With the battery out, and you static free, you remove the bottom plastic cover that hides the ram upgrade slots, which are easily accessible and within reach for  any easy RAM upgrade, and assuming you already have the new RAM in hand should only take you five minutes. On each end of the ram module are little plastic clips that when you pull them apart and away from RAM upgrade, allows the memory module to pop up in the memory slot at a 45 degree angle, which allows you to remove the factory RAM from the ram upgrade slot on the Dell Inspiron 17R.  Then you just repeat for the second memory module.</p>

<p>Once you have the RAM out of the Dell Inspiron 17r you can <strong>install the new RAM you bought</strong>, which is <strong><a href="http://www.dpbolvw.net/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT51264BC1339">4GB DDR3 SDRAM SODIMMS</a></strong>. This RAM upgrade is  sold in <strong><a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT2KIT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1339">8GB DDR3 memory upgrade Kits </a></strong>which is easier to buy than individual ram upgrades and you usually get a <strong>small discount on the memory upgrade kits</strong> instead  of <strong>buying the RAM upgrades individually</strong>. The new RAM has a slot on it so you really can’t mess up the Dell memory upgrade installation, as long as you take caution with static electricity. Just seat the bigger RAM for Dell in the new ram sockets and when seated, the  RAM module should click into place using those two little tabs, screw the plastic cover back onto the bottom of your Dell Inspiron 17R 2nd Generation and replace the battery. Flip the Dell over, and  you’re done.</p>

<p>One thing  I should note is that any** RAM install should be done on a clean, dry and preferably soft surface** (a towel works great  so you don’t scratch the laptop  lid).</p>

<p>This is the one time where I suggest you <strong><a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10639500">buy this model of Dell notebook directly from Dell</a></strong>, as opposed to say, Amazon which does have <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26x%3D0%26ref_%3Dnb_sb_noss%26y%3D0%26field-keywords%3D17%2520inch%2520laptop%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps%23&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">deals and best prices on other 17 inch notebooks</a></strong> but if you’re in the market for this particular  Dell model, your best bet is probably  to <strong>buy  the Dell Directly</strong>. As I write this, Dell has a <strong><a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10639500">12 day summer sale going on</a></strong> which might get you an even better price on an everyday 17 inch notebook from Dell if you’re lucky.</p>

<p>The <strong><a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10639500">2nd generation of Dell Notebooks</a></strong> with a 15 inch LCD display offer two features over the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/dell-inspiron-15r-n5010-memory-upgrades/" title="dell inspiron N5010 RAM">Dell Inspiron 15R N5010</a> and that’s a <strong>faster processor inside this dell laptop</strong> as well as (something I could care less about, but I’m probably not the market for this dell notebook anyway) and that’s the fact that the lids or top cover of this 15 inch notebook from <strong>Dell offers switch lids</strong>, and if you’ve got thirty bucks or so you can swap out the colors of your dell to personalize it further and make it stand out from other Dells, but I’d rather spend the switch lids money on something that will get you computing faster with the 2nd generation Dell 15R notebook computer, and that’s <strong>adding more RAM</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Cheapest RAM Prices for Dell Inspiron 15R 2nd Generation</strong></p>

<p><img src="http://i.dell.com/das/dih.ashx/314x314/images/global/products/314x314/inspiron-15r-right-black-alternate-314.jpg" alt="Dell Inspiron 15R Laptop Computer" border="0" /></p>

<p>This is probably one of the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/what-is-the-best-computer-brand-to-buy/" title="What is the Best Computer Brand to Buy?">best selling dell notebook computers</a> in 2011 thanks to the fact that it’s priced at under $500 at $499,  but I’d go and spend the additional $50 and buy the $549.00 Dell 15R as opposed to the older and slower model that doesn’t have as fast as a processor <strong>when comparing the two 15 inch Dell notebooks side by side</strong>.</p>

<p>At $549, the Dell packs a fair bit of notebook computer value and when you consider the fact a MacBook Pro 15 inch is $2000 or more –  a $500 notebook looks pretty good in 201.  The main features of the Dell Inspiron 15R  include the switch lids I mentioned above, but also is enabled for Widi and 3DTV that allows you to wirelessly project  your movies to your HDTV. You can buy the  Dell Inspiron 15R with 2nd generation Intel Core i7 processors, <strong>more RAM</strong>, bigger hard drives and add printers, monitors and other to your shopping cart, but at  $549 you’ll limited to an Intel Core i3 processor, <strong>4GB of DDR3 1333Mhz RAM</strong> which is actually a very usable RAM amount  and  for every day home use and web browsing like facebook, etc, it’s quite possible you won’t need to upgrade the RAM on the Dell Inspiron 15R.</p>

<p>But, I recommend two things: That you do buy more dell memory and you don’t buy  the RAM from Dell as it’s priced too much. 4GB DDR3 memory of which you’ll need two of to max out the RAM on a Dell 15R 2nd generation will set you back over $200 or more, where alternately you can <strong><a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT2KIT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1339">buy the maximum RAM of 8GB for well under $100</a></strong> and save closer to $200 on Dell memory uprades, all by taking 5 minutes to  shop around for the best prices on RAM Upgrades from memory vendors you can trust and are reputable, as that’s the only kind of RAM and  memory I recommend.</p>

<p>All this advice only applies to saving money on RAM upgrades on the Dell Inspiron 2nd generation 15R (which looks like a great deal on a windows 7 notebook) and if you’ve got deep pockets or don’t have the time to install the ram yourself (it’s easy to do a memory upgrade  on most any Dell computer – just pop the battery out, and there’s a cover on the bottom of the notebook you remove to acesss the two memory upgrade slots available) then you may  be better off just configuring the RAM when you buy the Inspiron online from Dell, but for those of us that want to save money on Dell Memory Upgrades, regardless s of specific model number.</p>

<p>To upgrade the RAM on Dell Inspiron 15R 2nd generation you’ll need to <strong><a href="http://www.dpbolvw.net/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT51264BC1339">buy two 4GB DDR3 1333mhz sodimms</a></strong>, usually sold in <strong><a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT2KIT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1339">8GB notebook memory upgrade kits</a></strong> that make it easy to upgrade the two slots available for upgrade on this affordable Dell designed for every day home and small office use.</p>

<p>**Dell Inspiron 15R 2nd Generation Deals and Best Prices **</p>

<p>Your best bet for a <strong>deal on a dell notebook</strong> is to buy it <a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10639500">directly from Dell</a> where you can configure your dell laptop with added software such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0050PJB32/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B0050PJB32">Microsoft Home and Office</a>, faster processors, bigger hard drives and even add extra switchable lids if that’s your thing, but I also recommend you check out Amazon for the <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fbestsellers%2Felectronics%2F565108%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref_%3Dzg_bs_nav%23&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">best notebook computer deals</a></strong> as well.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2011/05/how-much-ram-do-i-need-for-a-laptop/">How Much RAM Do I Need For A Laptop?</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>The short answer to how much memory you need – regardless of computer manufacturer – Mac or PC, is you <strong>need as much memory as possible</strong></p>

<p>There’s a good chance that you need to upgrade the laptop you’re using to read this with, as out of the box and direct from the factory, unless you bought a CTO (configured to order) PC that you chose to fill your laptop with, there’s a good chance the RAM you have installed is just enough to RUN the operating systems and not much else.</p>

<p>Apple Mac OS Snow Leopards Minimum RAM Requirements are 1GB, and 5GB of hard drive space, yet that is JUST for the operating system to RUN, and not much else, including the iApps such as iTunes, iPhoto and the like. And if you need to run Aperture or any processor intensive application that uses memory then the minimum recommended ram of 1GB for MacOS</p>

<p>On the Windows side of things, you’ll need even more memory. 1GB will do you for running 32 bit Windows 7, but if you need 64 bit Microsoft Windows for your laptop OS then 2GB is the minimum RAM you should have installed</p>

<p>As you can see, 1GB or even 2GB really isn’t a whole lot of RAM if you want to do anything with your computer than start it up. (try installing windows 7 or even Mac OS on a 1GB laptop and you’ll see what I mean)</p>

<p>In 2011, the minimum RAM I would recommend for every day computing is 4GB. 8GB is better if your notebook computer can accomodate the larger memory size, but if you’re looking to buy and upgrade a notebook computer in 2011 you’re best to max out your laptop to 8GB if you can.</p>

<p>**Best RAM Prices for Laptops.<br />
**</p>

<p>There’s a very good chance your laptop takes DDR3 1333Mhz memory upgrades and below is a table of the best notebook prices I have found on sale from memory stores you can trust that are much much cheaper than if you bought the memory from the PC manufacturers directly.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">Not much at all. </a></p>

<p>You can double the RAM in your MBP to 4GB very easily and cheaply just by adding more memory. You’ll  need to buy new ram upgrades and replace the ram  in your MacBook Pro – currently 2x1GB MacBook Pro RAM  with larger 2×2 GB RAM for MacBook Pros but the cost is negligible, especially if you are making your living with your MacBook Pro adding another 2gb of RAM will be like breathing a breath of fresh air into now what will be a discontinued MacBook Pro, as the current MBP’s take 8GB of DDR3 SDRAM.</p>

<p>I don’t know what specific model of MacBook Pro you’re looking to ugprade, but you should  be able to do so for not  much money at all. MacBook Pro models that accept 4GB are now, in 2011 a few years old and you could be looking to squeeze more life out of a 2009, 2010 or even 2008 MacBook Pro notebook, as these all max out with 4GB of memory.</p>

<p>You’ll be in the market for DDR3 1066 SDRAM dimms and a s you can see by the MacBook Pro RAM Price chart below RAM for MacBooks is cheaper than it has ever been before and  continues to drop in price over time, so if you want, you can wait until ram prices fall even further. But the disadvantage of this approach is that your’e sacrificing your time over money when the benefit of the ram will far outweigh the costs of a 4GB RAM upgrade for a MacBook Pro.</p>

<p>The HP DV6 notebook computer lineup comes in many different models and configurations  and has been a popular notebook computer from HP for some time, but I want to concentrate today on the newest and latest HP DV6 series notebooks as these are one of the best selling HP notebooks available today and run either i3, i5, or i7 Intel Core processors and when it comes to ram for the 2011 HP DV6 notebook lineup your best deal and correct RAM to buy is DDR3 1066MHz sdram sodimms.</p>

<p>Out of the box, whether you buy a HP DV6 series notebook from Best Buy, or  Amazon or even from HP directly this notebook comes shipped from the factory various with standard memory configurations depending on processor speed and model number, but  the maximum RAM for the HP DV6 notebooks stays the same at 8GB and unless you buy your HP completely configured with the maximum ram already installed that while is probably the easiest way to upgrade ram on this HP notebook, it’s far from the cheapest and you’re much better off  buying HP DV6 memory from a trusted memory store that guarantees the RAM to work just fine in your HP notebook, but for far less money than what you could expect to spend  on a HP memory upgrade.</p>

<p>[table id=8 /]</p>

<p>As you can see from above, the  prices above for HP DV6 ram and memory upgrades are quite reasonable with  an 8GB ram upgrade costing today less than $100 which is the maximum memory allowed on this notebook computer using two available memory upgrade slots.</p>

<p>To maximize the memory on your HP DV6 notebook  you will need to replace the memory currently installed  in your HP notebook and replace the memory upgrade modules with larger memory upgrade modules (<a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-1548159-10273954?url=http://www.crucial.com/store/affiliateredirect.asp?imodule=CT2KIT51264BC1067&amp;aid=1027395&amp;cid=777292&amp;subid=89&amp;PRS&amp;uscj&amp;cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1067">currently 8GB memory</a>), and after doing so, you will enjoy one of the fastest HP notebooks priced well under $700, just by adding more memory to your HP DV6 series notebook computer by HP.</p>

<p>I, at close to 15 years doing this – writing and tracking ram prices and memory upgrades from reputable ram vendors – I have come to realize one thing, and that’s ram gets cheaper and the standard or maximum ram size gets bigger.</p>

<p>It doesn’t seem too long ago, that a big deal with a memory upgrade was 256mb. Now that small amount of memory isn’t even an option for computers in 2011 regardless or make or manufacturer and as the years go by and the OS’s – both Mac and PC – get more and more bloated with prettier buttons and fancier features you can be sure of one thing, and that’s that all this stuff requires more RAM or memory.</p>

<p><strong>How Much Memory is Enough?</strong></p>

<p>In 2011, if you are going to make the effort and expense to upgrade the ram on your Mac or PC, I would start at 8GB, and if you have a modern computer (ie: Intel Core i3, i5, i7) then you will have no problem with adding 8GB of RAM to most modern computers today, especially for desktop computers.</p>

<p>Notebook computers on the other hand due mostly to the fact that there’s not a whole lot of space to put a memory ugprade, are a bit trickier to upgrade the RAM on, but again – 8GB RAM maximums are common on most notebook PC’s built today and although still pricey – costing as much as the notebook computer the memory is being installed in – 16GB RAM will be the defacto memory upgrade as the components for 16gb memory get cheaper over time. It wasn’t that long ago that installing 8gb of RAM in a notebook computer would cost you well over one thousand dollars, but now you can buy 8GB of notebook RAM for under $100.</p>

<p>You might be very happy running your computer with the RAM that it came from the factory and if all your computing needs happen in a web browser. (mine do) than the default 3GB or 4GB your notebook came with could very well be enough memory for facebook and the like.</p>

<p>But,if you make a living with your computer (I do, again) then 8GB is where I’d go when it comes to ram upgrades in 2011. With RAM so cheap (see ram price list below), especially for notebook computers and if you make a living with it, or just a serious hobbyist then 8GB ram upgrades from an array of memory stores are available for purchase, and all at significant savings when you compare the ram prices demanded by the computer manufacturers</p>

<p>Adding 8GB  of iMac RAM to a 4GB iMac depends on what specific Apple iMac you are looking at upgrading and even when it is possible, I don’t suggest it as it’s my thought that considering how cheap iMac RAM is these days, you’d be better off doing one of two upgrades:</p>

<p>For iMacs that can only accept 8GB as maximum memory and assuming your iMac ships from the factory with 4GB filling the memory slots (we’re going to assume your iMac only has two memory upgrade slots which was the case with older iMac released prior to summer 2010) you’ll have to replace the 2x2GB memory upgrades with 2x4GB memory modules to hit 8GB</p>

<p>But if you can hit 16GB on your iMac I suggest you maximize the RAM on your newer iMac (summer 2010 and  later) with the maximum memory allowed which at time of writing is 16GB of iMac RAM.</p>

<p>Adding 8GB of iMac RAM to 4GB, while in some iMac configurations is possible, doesn’t make a bunch of sense to me when for under $200 you can completely fill your iMac with the most ram it can handle.</p>

<p>For additional savings on your iMac RAM purchase you can even sell back the iMac RAM you had from the factory for even more savings off your $200 Apple iMac  RAM upgrade total price.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/OWC">OWC </a>will buy back your RAM and at the time I write this will pay you $27 for your 4GB of RAM on 2010 and 2011 Apple iMac models, that if you apply to the total cost of your new iMac 16GB upgrade (two 8GB ddr3 memory upgrade kits are required) you could have your new iMac filled with RAM for a touch over $150.00, (plus taxes, and shipping fees)</p>

<p>And speaking of fees for shipping, most online vendors offer free shipping on this much memory for iMacs, not to mention the out of state tax savings you could be eligible for as well in some cases.</p>

<p>So to answer your question: Yes you can add 8GB of iMac RAM but you’re better off either saving more money on RAM and only adding an additional 4GB or go all out and fill your iMac with as much RAM as possible, which is 16GB of iMac RAM</p>

<p>Here’s the current best and lowest RAM prices for iMac to help you decide on what size memory upgrade to get for your iMac</p>

<p>The Apple MacBook Pro 2.66, while now in 2011 is a discontinued Apple computer model, it’s still a bargain to <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com">upgrade the RAM </a>on this powerful notebook from  Apple with a 2.66GHz Intel Core i7 and I’m not the only one that thinks this, as this particular memory upgrade is one of the best selling ram upgrades you can buy today.</p>

<p><strong>RAM Specifications for Apple MacBook Pro 2.66</strong></p>

<p>The Apple MacBook Pro 2.66 17 inch notebook shipped from Apple  with just 4GB of RAM installed at the factory, but you can easily double the RAM on this notebook computer by buying 2x4GB memory modules, or  if you prefer an 8GB  memory upgrade kit  for MacBook Pro to max out the memory on this specific MacBook Pro Model using the two upgrade slots available in the MacBook Pro. You do have to replace the factory installed 2x2GB ram modules with the larger 4GB memory upgrades as there’s very little room inside a MacBook Pro  as apposed to a desktop system that allows for more ram capacity and memory configuration choices.</p>

<p>**How to Install MacBook Pro 2.66 GHz Intel Core i7 RAM **</p>

<p>It’s really easy to install the memory yourself on the MacBook Pro 2.66Ghz and if you buy quality ram and take your time on the ram install and guard against static electricity the result will be a faster MacBook Pro than before, which is one of the reasons for a memory upgrade in the first place.</p>

<p>Apple will even provide you with <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1270">handy instructions</a> on how to perform the upgrade of your MacBook Pro 2.66Ghz step by step and althogh this may not apply anymore, depending on whether you bought AppleCare for your 2010 MacBook Pro will not void your warranty either.</p>

<p>It’s really a  simple  upgrade and memory prices haven’t been cheaper ever, so now’s the time to <strong><a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-1548159-10273954?url=http://www.crucial.com/store/affiliateredirect.asp?imodule=CT2KIT51264BC1067&amp;aid=1027395&amp;cid=777292&amp;subid=89&amp;PRS&amp;uscj&amp;cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1067">max out the ram on your MacBook Pro 2.66 Ghz </a></strong>to 8GB and enjoy a faster and smoother running MacBook Pro 2.66Ghz as a result.</p>

<p>Introduced just a few months ago in Feb 2011, the<strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002C74D7A/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399349&amp;creativeASIN=B002C74D7A">17 inch 2.2 GHz Apple MacBook Pro</a> **is the **biggest and fastest Apple MacBook Pro you can buy today in 2011</strong> and offers 17 inches of screen real estate – the most MacBook screen you can buy for power users that need as much on their screen at once without having to switch windows or connect the MacBook Pro to an external display- this is a fantastic Apple notebook for graphics professionals on the go and a favorite amongst digital video photography users who need all the screen and power possible</p>

<p><strong>Apple MacBook Pro 17 inch RAM Prices</strong></p>

<p>[table id=1 /]</p>

<p>I have already written about the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/upgrade-macbook-to-8gb-ram/" title="Upgrade MacBook To 8GB RAM">benefits of maxing out the RAM on your MacBook Pro to 8GB</a>, or<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/apple-macintosh-memory-16gb-macbook-pro-ram/" title="16GB MacBook Pro RAM"> even 16GB if you can afford it</a> for the cheaper MacBook Pro models” <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/apple-macbook-pro-13-inch-2-3ghz-memory-upgrade-prices/" title="Apple MacBook Pro 13 inch 2.3GHz Memory Upgrade Prices">13 inch 2.3GHz</a>,<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/apple-macbook-pro-13-inch-2-7ghz-ram-upgrade-options-and-prices/" title="Apple MacBook Pro 13 inch 2.7GHz RAM Upgrade Options and Prices"> 13 inch 2.7 Ghz</a>, <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/apple-macbook-pro-15-inch-2-0ghz-memory-and-ram-upgrade-choices/" title="Apple MacBook Pro 15 inch 2.0GHz Memory and RAM Upgrade Choices">15 inch 2.0 GHz</a> and <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/apple-macbook-pro-15-inch-2-2-ghz-memory-upgrades/" title="Apple MacBook Pro 15 inch 2.2 GHz Memory Upgrades">15 inch 2.2 GHz</a> and ho**w buying and adding more RAM for the MacBook Pro **is the best deal when considering any Apple upgrade – even before  software or more storage space, like <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/best-ssd-hard-drives-for-2011/" title="Best SSD Hard Drives for 2011">SSD hard drives</a> that offer even faster storage and data retrieval but the price to performance ratio still leans heavy towards price for solid state drives in 2011 and so far this year you are best to spend your money on RAM unless you have the ultimate need for speed or deep pockets.</p>

<p>Buying <a href="http://store.apple.com">RAM from Apple direct</a> is probably the easiest way to <strong>max out the RAM on the new MacBook Pro 17 inch 2.2 GHz</strong>, but do you see the price for MacBook Pro RAM from the Apple Store? It’s kindof pricey when you compare ram prices from other trusted memory manufacturers like Crucial who offers much more competitive prices and as I write this you can <strong><a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT2KIT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1339">max out your MBP 17 RAM for under $100 </a></strong>which is a savings of over $300 on your RAM upgrade – enough for you to buy that faster SSD drive at the same time as your ram order, rather than pay what in my opinion is too much for MacBook Pro RAM from Apple directly.</p>

<p>**MacBook Pro 17 inch RAM Upgrades Are Easy. **</p>

<p>If you pay a bit of attention to what you’re doing and use some precaution when it comes to static electricity, your RAM upgrade can be done by yourself, and all you have to do is <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com">buy the memory</a>, remove the old factory installed memory modules and replace them with the larger sized memory modules you bought to replace them with. Simple as pie, and your MacBook Pro 17 inch will run much faster when you <strong>double or even quadruple the memory</strong> upgrade in it.</p>

<p>The best part about uprading MacBook Book Pro RAM itself on the MacBook Pros is that Apple even <strong><a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1270">provide instructions</a></strong> on how to do so. Step by step, you’re led through the memory upgrade process where you can upgrade the memory all by yourself without having to take the MacBook Pro into a service center or store such as Best Buy to have the RAM installed.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MX5YWI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399349&amp;creativeASIN=B001MX5YWI"><img title="MacBook Pro sodimm memory" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51pi-7HjvPL._SL500_AA300_.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a></p>

<p>*8GB Apple MacBook Pro Memory Upgrade Kit is above. note the slot in the sodimm – you can’t screw up the memory install if you take your time. *</p>

<p>The RAM on the MacBook Pro is 1333MHz and in a 240 pin sodimm memory module with a little slot in the chip so you cannot install the memory backwards or upside down. On the MacBook Pro, there’s two memory upgrade slots to upgrade the RAM, but unlike Apple desktops like the iMac, there’s not a whole lot of room inside the MacBook Pro so you need to remove or replace the factory RAM (which you can sell) and replace it with the larger memory modules you have bought.</p>

<p>Why Apple doesn’t fill the 17 inch MacBook Pro with at least 8GB is beyond  me, especially considering this MacBook Pro is not a <strong>cheap netbook computer</strong> but priced over two thousand dollars you’d think that they could bump the RAM to 8GB, which as the year progresses is becoming the standard memory configuration when it comes to average ram needed for computing in 2011, and especially considering this MacBook Pro model is aimed a professional users who will be running applications like Photoshop and Final Cut Pro that will happily take all the memory you can throw at them.</p>

<p>So. If you’re either buying a MacBook Pro or already own one, do yourself a big favor and spend less than $100 on a MacBook Pro RAM Upgrade and enjoy the biggest and fastest Apple notebook in 2011 by <strong><a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT2KIT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1339">doubling the memory upgrades on your 17 inch 2.2 GHz Apple MacBook Pro.</a></strong></p>

<p>The <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/fastest-ram-for-macbook-pro-2010/" title="Fastest RAM for MacBook Pro 2010 and 2011">fastest Apple MacBook Pro</a></strong>, the 2011 15 inch 2.2 Ghz model that features a 2.2. Ghz Intel Core i7 processor can be made to go even faster for under $100  (see the chart above for current MacBook Pro RAM Prices)</p>

In the case of the 2010 Apple MacBook Pro, all <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/best-prices-for-notebook-memory-ddr-3-1066mhz-204-pin-sodimms/" title="Best Prices for Notebook Memory: DDR 3 1066Mhz 204 Pin SODIMMS">2010 MacBook Pros require 1066 SDRAM sodimms</a> while the latest and newest MacBook Pros run <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/best-prices-for-notebook-memory-ddr3-1333mhz-204-pin-sodimms/" title="Best Prices for Notebook Memory: DDR3 1333Mhz 204 Pin SODIMMS">1333MHz DDR3 RAM</a> that is completely different from the ram the older MacBook Pros take.</p>

<p>While it’s true there are bigger and faster MacBook Pros and even <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/best-notebook-computers-of-2011/" title="Best NoteBook Computers of 2011">best selling notebooks</a> such as the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/macbook-pro-13-3-inch-8gb-memory-upgrades/" title="MacBook Pro 13.3 inch 8GB Memory Upgrades">13 inch MacBook Pro</a> which seems to be a hit due to the perfect balance of notebook display size and price performance, this <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0017HSZWK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399349&amp;creativeASIN=B0017HSZWK">15 inch 2.2GHz MBP</a></strong> offers the fastest MacBook Pro to date in 2011 (a referesh again later in the year? It’s anybody’s guess  maybe in the fall just in time to buy a MacBook Pro for Christmas) Without having to go to the next size up; the <strong>17 inch Apple MacBook Pro</strong> that does offer even faster performance and comes at a bigger size , where portability and light weight are a concern and you still need as much screen real estate as you possibly can  the 15 inch MacBook Pro 2.2 Ghz might be considered the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/best-2011-notebook-computer-brands/" title="Best 2011 Notebook Computer Brands"><strong>best MacBook Pro deal today</strong> </a>for those wanting to buy a fast Apple notebook.</p>

<p>And sadly as  I made note above: You can’t take your old ram with you (<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/where-can-i-sell-old-ram/" title="Where Can I Sell Old RAM?">you could sell it though</a>) so to get the most out of a computer that’s not cheap by any means you really should<strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com"> buy more ram</a></strong> and max out the memory on your MacBook Pro 2.2Ghz RAM.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>Apple Store RAM Prices for MacBook Pro 15 inch 2.2Ghz i7</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://store.apple.com" title="Apple Store">Apple Store</a> offers a lot of things including <strong>best selling ipads, ipods</strong> and the like, and they’ve even been know to make some of the best notebook computers available but if there’s one thing that’s been pretty consistent it’s this: Apple RAM is expensive. Especially when you <strong>compare ram prices from Apple to other third party memory products</strong> I track and monitor where you could buy essentially the same memory upgrade for Apple for about <strong>25% of the cost of  memory from the Apple Store.</strong></p>

<p>Now,  if you tend to have either deep pockets, or perhaps buying cheaper RAM for 15 inch MBP’s is not your concern then go ahead and buy Apple RAM. It won’t be the cheapest RAM you can buy but you do get the advantage of your memory upgrades all shipping from the same company and if you buy the MacBook Pro 15 inch 2.2 GHz  at the same time as your RAM, Apple will ship your RAM already installed so when you take your brand new 2011 Apple MacBook out of the box you won’t have to worry about RAM upgrades at all.</p>

<p><strong>20 11 15 inch 2.2 Ghz Memory Upgrade Instructions</strong></p>

<p>Apple might not be the wisest choice when it comes to saving money on memory upgrades but they do offer fantastic instructions on <strong>how to upgrade MacBook Pro 2.2 GHz RAM</strong>. It might be common knowledge to some of you I’m sure but a lot of folks don’t know that a memory upgrade is the best computing dollar you can spend and that it’s easy to do and will not void  your warranty. In fact, Apple even shows you<a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1270#link3" title="how to upgrade macbook memory"> how to upgrade 15 inch MacBook RAM</a> with easy to follow instructions.</p>

<p>Out of the box, the Apple MacBook Pro 2.2 Ghz 15 inch ships with just<strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/how-much-memory-will-a-macbook-pro-recognize/" title="How Much Memory Will A MacBook Pro Recognize?"> 4GB of RAM</a></strong> as  standard but when you carefully follow the instructions above, you can double your memory to 8GB MacBook Pro Memory for much less than just a few months ago, or if you go against the maximum RAM suggested by Apple some stores will sell you <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/apple-macintosh-memory-16gb-macbook-pro-ram/" title="16GB MacBook Pro RAM">MacBook Pro 16GB RAM upgrades</a></strong>.  I’m always hesitant to suggest y0u upgrade to more than the maximum Apple suggests even though for most instances, the maximum memory specified by Apple is due to the fact that bigger ram chips were not available at the release date so the maximum memory allowed is simply due to that fact alone, but if I had a brand new Apple computer that cost over $2000 I can tell you I would be reluctant to install more RAM than what Apple states is the allowed maximum.</p>

<p><a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1270#link3" title="detailed memory upgrade instructions">Detailed memory upgrade instructions</a> are included in the link above, but the latest Apple MacBook Pro 15 inch models are pretty <strong>easy to upgrade the memory</strong> on: You remove the bottom, and the RAM upgrades are looking at you without any further computer dismantling, allowing you easy access to the 2 memory upgrade slots where you will have to remove the RAM installed by the factory (Apple) and replace it with your new larger <strong><a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT2KIT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1339">2x 4GB memory modules for the 8GB maximum</a></strong> MacBook Pro RAM as per Apple, or 16GB if you need the most RAM you can possibly fit  into your MacBook Pro.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>A ram upgrade is the <strong>best computer upgrade you can do for any computer</strong> and it’s the very first thing I do when I pull a new Mac out of the box. ( not that this is an every day thing, I’m writing this on a 2008 MacBook Pro).  Software, or even hard drives, like a <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/best-ssd-hard-drives-for-2011/" title="Best SSD Hard Drives for 2011">new SSD hard drive</a></strong> which would come in as a close second upgrade I would perform on this MacBook Pro but memory is most important and now in 2011, cheap. RAM for MacBook Pros regardless of size has never been cheaper than it is today.  The best value for a ram upgrade is a 8GB MacBook  Pro memory upgrade kit, as the 16GB ram uprades are still too pricey for all but those needing to be on the bleeding edge of technology. The 8GB option still doubles your MacBook Pro RAM yet is affordable unlike the  16GB.  Wait  a bit for the 16GB to drop in price (it’s dropped $100 in price in the past week) to a more realistic and affordable memory upgrade choice for the MacBook Pro 2.2 inch</p>

<p>The new iMac models from Apple ship with Intel quad core processors across the board with today’s announcement and this means that as of today, the 2011 Apple iMac announced today, and that includes the new Apple iMac 21.5 inch 3.06GHz, Apple iMac 21.5 inch 3.2GHz, Apple iMac 27 inch 3.2Ghz, and Apple iMac 27 inch 2.8GHz quad core released in the summer of 2010 are discontinued as current iMac models, and if you don’t need to buy the latest iMac, now is the perfect time to buy an Apple iMac from 2010 that yesterday was a current iMac model, but are now on sale at a discount today and you can <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26x%3D0%26ref_%3Dnb_sb_noss%26y%3D0%26field-keywords%3Dimac%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps%23&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">save at least ten percent off</a> 2010 Apple iMac computers if you hurry with savings up to $300 off.<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1894" title="2011 Apple iMac" alt="" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Screen-shot-2011-05-03-at-7.14.54-PM.png" width="477" height="406" /></p>

<p><strong>Faster Processors in the 2011 iMacs<br />
**But when  it comes to the new Apple iMacs for 2011, regardess of which screen size iMac you choose to buy the newest Apple iMac models all ship with faster processors and unlike the now discontinued 2010 iMacs, all are Intel Quad Core processors, which according to Apple can process up to 2x faster than the older Apple iMac models thanks to the Intel Core quad core i5 and i7 processors, (no more Intel i3 for the iMacs) the Apple iMac is available to buy in four different configurations – **two iMacs with 21 inch displays</strong> and <strong>two iMacs with 27 inch displays</strong>:</p>

</ul>

<p>The Apple iMac prices you see above are the suggested retail price, but you can do much better on Apple iMac deals when you buy an iMac from an online retailer like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26x%3D0%26ref_%3Dnb_sb_noss%26y%3D0%26field-keywords%3Dapple%2520imac%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps%23&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">Amazon</a> or <a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-1548159-10847025">MacMall</a>, where the new Apple iMac models can be bought for much than paying full price for an Apple iMac from the Apple Store.</p>

<p><strong>Bigger iMac Hard Drive Options<br />
**<br />
All Apple iMac models ship from Apple with at least a **500GB hard drive</strong> in the cheapest iMac, the 21.5 inch 2.5 GHz and all other iMac models in the 2011 Apple iMac lineup feature 1TB hard drives standard, with options to upgrade to a <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/best-ssd-hard-drives-for-2011/" title="Best SSD Hard Drives for 2011">SSD solid state hard drive</a> at checkout</p>

<p><strong>Video Card Memory and Speed<br />
** All the 2011 Apple iMacs now come with faster video cards by AMD and depending on what model of iMac ship with either **AMD RADEON HD graphics cards</strong> running at least 512MB G5DDR Video memory for <strong>faster graphics performance</strong> in every new Apple iMac, and the 3.1 GHz ship standard with 1GB of video memory, while all others come out of the box with 512mb AMD video RAM.</p>

<p>**Video and Camera Support<br />
** The newest Apple iMacs this year also come standard with high definition video cameras built into each and every iMac and feature FaceTime, where you can now chat in full HD with each other (assuming you both have HD face time cameras) . Also, if the built in display isn’t big enough for you with the new iMacs, there’s also video out support for external monitors up to 30 inches in size for even added screen real estate.</p>

<p><strong>New iMac Connection and expansion options<br />
** For the new 2011 Apple iMacs, there’s new ways to connect and interface with other components externally to your iMac, and the iMac is the newest int the Apple lineup to feature **<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/2011-apple-macbook-pros-announced/" title="2011 Apple MacBook Pros Announced">thunderbolt technology</a></strong> which offers one thunderbolt port on the smaller iMacs, two on the 27 inch Apple iMacs, a Mini Display Port output, One 7 watt firewire 800 port, four USB 2.0 ports, a <strong>sdxc memory card slot</strong> (more on that later) and slot loading 8x superdrive, audio in and out and 10/100/1000 Base ethernet in a a RJ45 connector rounding out the connection options.</p>

<p><strong>Wireless KeyBoard and Mouse<br />
** One of the nicest things about the new Apple iMacs is the fact that with the release of the 2011 Apple iMacs in the spring of 2011 (May is still spring, wish as we may otherwise) is that there’s absolutely **no wires to connect the keyboard and mouse</strong> and Apple magic trackpad as all the devices connect wirelessly to all models of iMac computer announced today without the need for unsightly wires and cords resulting in a cleaner desktop space. Built in support for wi-fi wireless 80211.n and bluetooth 2.1 are included in the Apple iMacs of course, this seems almost silly to mention in 2011 as the iMac is the most modern Apple desktop computer you can buy today.</p>

<p>**2011 Apple iMac Size and Weight<br />
** The smaller Apple iMacs, the 21.5 inch Apple iMacs come in these dimensions:</p>

<p>Height: 17.75 inches (45.1 cm)<br />
Width: 20.8 inches (52.8 cm)<br />
Depth: 7.42 inches (18.85 cm)<br />
Weight: 20.5 pounds (9.3 kg)3</p>

<p>And the bigger Apple iMacs are of course, bigger and heavier with the 27 inch iMac topping 30lbs, although I suppose you could carry the iMac with you, 30lbs gets heavy quite fast and you may need a portable Mac notebook instead.</p>

<p>Height: 20.4 inches (51.7 cm)<br />
Width: 25.6 inches (65.0 cm)<br />
Depth: 8.15 inches (20.7 cm)<br />
Weight: 30.5 pounds (13.8 kg)3</p>

<p>**Apple iMac AppleCare Warranty and Service<br />
**</p>

<p>Out of the box, all Apple iMacs ship out of the box with 90 days of telephone support and one year limited warranty from Apple in the rare case you do have Apple iMac problems. I have found that the included warranty is enough as for most of us, we will buy an Apple iMac put it on a desk -and because it’s a Mac – just start using it. Unlike a notebook Apple computer, unless you drown the keyboard with coke (which wouldn’t be covered anyway I don’t see the need or value for buying an extended warranty and just use the standard warranty. <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/is-applecare-for-a-2011-macbook-pro-worth-it/" title="Is AppleCare for a 2011 MacBook Pro Worth It?">I’ve written about the pros and cons of the Apple warranty</a> before if you’d like to do more reading, but rest assured the warranty on the 2011 iMac will do just fine for all but a few iMac users.</p>

<p>**What’s in the 2011 Apple iMac Box<br />
** Every 2011 Apple iMac ships with the same accessories and the only difference being the iMac itself but besides the Apple iMac, you also get:</p>

<p>Apple Wireless Keyboard<br />
Apple Magic Mouse<br />
Power cord<br />
Install/restore DVDs<br />
Printed and electronic documentation</p>

<p>**Apple iMac Configuration Options<br />
**</p>

<p>Software included with 2011 Apple iMac</p>

<p>For a lot of you, this is the very reason, aside from great looks and features the iMac offers is why you buy the iMac and that’s the great software that each iMac comes with. Otherwise, we’d all end up buying cheaper PC’s. <img src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> But Apple’s desktop computer aimed at the home, school and home office user (and in some cases, business) ships standard with Mac OS X Snow Leopard that offers iTunes, Time Machine, Quick Look, Spaces, Spotlight, Dashboard, Mail, iChat, Safari, Address Book, QuickTime, iCal, DVD Player, Photo Booth, Front Row, Xcode Developer Tools to name a few common and popular Apple applications. But the iLife applications suite is also included too: iPhoto, iMovie, Garage Band and iMovie are also standard across the 2011 Apple iMac lineup.</p>

<p>**Configurable Apple iMac Options<br />
** One of the few reasons to buy direct from the Apple Store (I prefer Amazon) is that you can upgrade direct right from the factory when you buy the 2011 Apple iMac, but one thing that’s interesting is that depending on what iMac you’re interested in, the result will be different when it comes to options other than the iMac itself.</p>

<p>Apple iMac 21.5 inch, 2.5GHz at $1199 (cheaper at Amazon) allows you upgrade the RAM to 8GB and buy a Magic Trackpad. On the Apple iMac Apple iMac 21.5 inch 2.7GHz at $1499, (see best price) you get the option of adding the RAM and Magic TrackPad, but also the memory upgrade options jump to 16GB of iMac RAM, the hard drive on the 2011 Apple iMac can be upgraded to 2TB, and a 256GB solid state hard drive and 2.8Ghz processor upgrade is possible as well.</p>

<p>The 27 inch Apple iMacs offer the most configuration options with the cheaper 27 inch Apple iMac coming with the ability to upgrade the memory to 16GB, add a Magic Trackpad, a 2TB hard drive or even a 256 GB solid state hard drive for faster performance. The fastest iMac 27 inch model also allows the same upgrade choices as the other models but also includes the option to bump the processor to 3.4 GHz as well as upgrade the video card to a AMD Radeon HD 6970M with 2GB of GDDR5 memory.</p>

<p>**iMac RAM is the best upgrade you can do for iMac **</p>

<p>**<br />
** It should probably come as no surprise that I’m recommending the memory upgrades but it’s my opinion this is the one thing you should do right away, but not buy from the mother ship, as it’s <a href="http://store.apple.com/us/memorymodel/ME_IMAC_S11_21">just too expensive right now</a> when you can buy the same memory upgrades for Apple iMacs for much much less than Apple’s prices when it comes to ram prices for the 2011 Apple iMacs:<br />
[table id=2 /]</p>

<p>At the time I write this, you can max out the iMac with 4x 4GB DDR3 1333Mhz sdram sodimms for under $200 (assuming you need to buy 16GB of 2011 Apple iMac RAM)</p>

<p>One of the nicer things about the 2011 iMacs is the memory upgrade specifications didn’t change at all with this refresh of the Apple iMac lineup and you can still use DDR3 1333MHz 10600 notebook sodimms as the RAM for 2010 and 2011 iMacs are the same so if you do have a 2010 iMac this is one of the few models you can still use the same memory for the different model years. This is not the case with the Apple MacBook Pros that require you to use all new memory as the RAM in the 2010 and 2011 MacBook Pro is a completely different memory type.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>It’s been close to a year since we last saw an  Apple iMac refresh of any kind, and the faster processors, graphics cards, and even the thunderbolt technology  isn’t really that much of a surprise to me as it was introduced on the MacBook Pro in Feb, it was only a matter of months before the ThuderBolt started to show up on other newer Apple computers too.</p>

<p>One thing I am happy about is that the ram for the iMacs is the same as the older summer 2010 iMacs which means that when you want to upgrade your iMac to this year’s model, you can take your memory upgrade with you.</p>

<p>I had hoped that the 16GB RAM limit might be increased, but I guess for most iMac consumers, 16GB of RAM is more than enough for every day computing which is  what the iMac was designed for, and with <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/imac-memory-upgrade-review/" title="iMac Memory Upgrade Review">8GB iMac RAM </a>being the sweet spot for iMac RAM prices right now, there’s few reasons right now to bump the upgrades to 16GB for iMac just yet.  I wouldn’t be surprised if OWC and other memory stores start to advertise higher capacity memory upgrades for the iMac at a later date, and  when they do, I’ll be sure to keep you posted on any changes with adding more ram to your iMac.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>I have already covered the the ram upgrades for the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/apple-macbook-pro-13-inch-2-3ghz-memory-upgrade-prices/" title="Apple MacBook Pro 13 inch 2.3GHz Memory Upgrade Prices">smaller and cheaper Apple MacBook Pro models</a> for 2011, so now it’s time to check out what’s a good deal when it comes to ram prices for  the most versatile of the  2011 MacBook Pro lineup – Apple MacBook Pro 15 inch 2.0GHz featuring the Intel Quad Core i7 processor.</p>

<p>The bigger screen real estate paired with the faster processor on the lower end or <strong>cheaper MacBook Pro</strong> means that the 15 inch MacBook Pro 2.0 Ghz could very well be the sweet spot when it comes time to <strong>decide what MacBook Pro to buy</strong> (or  upgrade to if you’re switching from the Windows OS)</p>

<p>**You Can Buy RAM from Apple **</p>

<p>Out of the box, the Apple MacBook Pro 15 inch 2.0 GHz comes shipped standard with just 4GB of RAM, which in my opinion is too little RAM for a modern and professional MacBook Pro, regardless of what size you choose to buy: 13 inch, 15 inch and  17 inch MacBook Pros all suffer this same fate of too little RAM installed, considering how cheap memory is today and how valuable more MacBook RAM is.</p>

<p>The easiest way to buy RAM  is to just <a href="http://store.apple.com">buy the memory upgrade direct from Apple</a> as that would seem to make the most sense. You bought the computer from Apple (or a reseller such as Amazon) so it would only makes sense to buy the RAM from the same store that you bought your 15 inch MacBook Pro from. And you can do this, just visit the apple store and <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/8gb-kit-for-macbook-pro/" title="8GB Kit for MacBook Pro">buy 8GB of  RAM for MacBook Pro</a></strong>. The problem is that at the time of writing this  8GB for MacBook Pro from Apple will cost you $400.</p>

<p>Compare this to the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/macbook-pro-ddr3-1333mhz-memory-upgrade-prices/" title="MacBook Pro DDR3 1333Mhz Memory Upgrade Prices">cheapest price you can buy ram for the Apple MacBook Pro 15 inch</a>, that at the time I write this is under $100 with the <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial" title="cheapest macbook pro 8gb ram">cheapest MacBook Pro 8GB RAM upgrade kits being available for $93.00</a></strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Trade in Apple Factory RAM</strong></p>

<p>The <strong>best price on RAM for  the  2011 MacBook Pro models</strong> is well under $100, but you can <strong>save money on RAM upgrades</strong> even more when you remove the 4GB of factory memory, replace it with 2x 4GB DDR3 1333Mhz memory you buy online from  any one of the memory stores above, and if you buy RAM from <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/oempcworld">OEMPCWORLD</a>, <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/OWC">OWC</a> and <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/ramjet">RAMJET</a> you can save even more money on the final costs of 8GB for MacBook Pro 15 inch 2.0 GHz by selling your old memory – or factory memory back to these stores that buy back RAM for MacBook Pros.</p>

<p>You can also sell the smaller 2x 2GB memory modules privately as well on <a href="http://www.craigslist.org" title="sell ram on privately">craigslist</a> or <a href="http://www.ebay.com" title="ebay memory deals">eBay</a> and  you will make more money this way in most cases, but the price for doing so is  time. When you <strong>trade in your Mac memory</strong>, you might not get top dollar for it but it’s way easier and  you still <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/how-do-i-know-what-is-the-right-size-memory-for-macbook-pro/" title="How Do I Know What Is The Right Size Memory for MacBook Pro?">save some money on 8GB memory kits for MacBook Pros</a></strong>.</p>

<p>**16GB RAM for 15 inch MacBook Pro **</p>

<p>This will change as all ram prices drop for the largest memory configuration for any computer, not jus the MacBook Pro but unless you really need to have a lot of memory for video editing, or some other professional use that warrants the costs of 16GB for MacBook Pro, I can’t really recommend you <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/apple-macintosh-memory-16gb-macbook-pro-ram/" title="16GB MacBook Pro RAM">buy 16GB RAM for MacBook Pro</a> as it’s just too expensive. I bet a year from now, the price will be less than half of what it is now, but for now your <strong>best deal on MacBook Pro RAM is the 8GB RAM upgrade kits</strong> that still double the RAM your 15 inch MBP 2.0 i7 came with and offers much more breathing room for running more applications and not just the free software that comes standard with every Apple Macintosh computer</p>

<p><strong>15 inch MacBook Pro Memory Install Instructions</strong></p>

<p>The good folks at Apple will gladly show you <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1270#link3">how to install memory upgrades for this particular 15 inch Apple MacBook Pro</a>, as well as all 2011 Macbook Pro models released the end of February 2011.</p>

<p>Memory installs on the newest and <strong>cheapest Apple MacBook Pro</strong> with a 15 inch display could  not be easier and assuming you follow the MacBook Pro memory installation instructions you can do the memory install all by yourself, and without voiding the one year limited warranty the 15 inch MacBook Pro ships with as standard  (of course, you can <strong>buy AppleCare</strong> if you want to continue the warranty past the one  year but the cost for an Apple extended warranty will set you back about another $100 per year, on average).</p>

<p>This is all in the <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1270">manual for MacBook Pro 15 inch 2.0Ghz</a>, but the ram install is super easy on this model and is the exact same as the installation on the 13 inch MacBook Pros so I won’t repeat it again here.</p>

<p>I will caution you, when handling any memory product, that this stuff is sensitive to static electricity, so please do your best to remove any static charges on your body before you go handling any memory product, as RAM isn’t cheap as being free yet and one little zap could fry your RAM.</p>

<p>To summarize, <strong>don’t buy RAM from Apple unless you have extra money to spend</strong> unnecessarily when you can buy RAM from many honest RAM stores that will be happy to help you with <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/macbook-pro-ddr3-1333mhz-memory-upgrade-prices/" title="MacBook Pro DDR3 1333Mhz Memory Upgrade Prices">15 inch MacBook Pro RAM Upgrades</a></strong> for much less than what Apple charges currently.</p>

<p>It truly boggles my mind why, if all the 2011 <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/what-is-the-difference-between-4gb-and-8gb-for-macbook-pro/" title="What is the Difference Between 4GB and 8GB for MacBook Pro?">MacBook Pro models can accept 8GB of RAM </a>that Apple doesn’t release All their notebook models and consumer desktops like the <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/imac-ddr3-1333mhz-memory-upgrade-prices/" title="iMac DDR3 1333Mhz Memory Upgrade Prices">iMac</a></strong> and <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/mac-mini-ddr3-memory-upgrade-prices/" title="Mac Mini DDR3 Memory Upgrade Prices">Mac Mini</a></strong>with the maximum memory already installed, but for some reason they don’t and it’s probably to stay more competitive in price with windows PCs, there’s a reason <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/apple-macbook-pro-13-inch-2-3ghz-memory-upgrade-prices/" title="Apple MacBook Pro 13 inch 2.3GHz Memory Upgrade Prices">the 13 inch 2.3 GHz MacBook Pro</a> is the best selling notebook available today, and that’s due to the fact that it’s also the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26x%3D0%26ref_%3Dnb_sb_noss%26y%3D0%26field-keywords%3Dmacbook%2520pro%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">cheapest MacBook Pro you can buy today</a> – filling the 13 inch MBP with memory would raise the cost because as you can see from the chart above – <strong>RAM isn’t free</strong>.</p>

<p>**MacBook Pro RAM is Cheap<br />
**<br />
While you still have to pay for ram upgrades for the MacBook Pro and with the exceptions of <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/apple-macintosh-memory-16gb-macbook-pro-ram/" title="16GB MacBook Pro RAM">16GB RAM for the 2011 MacBook Pros</a> – 8GB of MacBook Pro RAM is pretty cheap, especially if you consider the fact that for most of us MacBook Pro users – we’re earning living with this Apple laptop that’s the fastest, smallest portable from Apple you can buy today.</p>

<p>**Buy 8GB Memory Upgrades for MacBook Pro<br />
**</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/macbook-pro-ddr3-1333mhz-memory-upgrade-prices/" title="MacBook Pro DDR3 1333Mhz Memory Upgrade Prices">8GB of RAM for MacBook Pro</a> is where the sweet spot is when it comes to ram upgrades for not only this Apple MacBook Pro model, but 15 inch and 17 inch MacBook Pro’s too. Sure, you can buy 16GB but only from a select few memory stores that carry 16GB for MacBook Pro and currently priced at $1599, this is price out of realistic prices for most of us, save for a few who need the ultimate ram upgrade for MacBook Pro.</p>

<p>8GB of MacBook Pro RAM double the ram installed on the faster 13 inch MacBook Pro but still costs under $100 – a paltry sum when you compare the price against the original price you paid on the faster smaller MBP.</p>

<p>Now that we’ve decided that 8GB of RAM is where we need to be, the trick is to buy macbook pro ram. Above are current street prices on MacBook Pro memory with regular price updates by yours truly, and these are all <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/where-to-buy-computer-memory-upgrades/" title="Where to Buy Computer Memory Upgrades">memory stores I trust</a> when it comes to upgrading RAM for the MacBook Pro 13 incher. RAM is fragile electronics, and you want to buy a quality memory upgrade product and not some junk with an unknown origin or even more important – customer support, another factor to consider when buying MacBook Pro RAM.</p>

<p>**Buying RAM from Apple<br />
**</p>

<p>You can, and you’ll get fantastic customer support and a quality memory upgrade as the MacBook Pro ships with Samsung or Micron memory, or at least – that’s been my experience when upgrading RAM on my personal MacBook Pro models. But the kicker with buying memory from Apple is the price – at the time I write this, an <a href="http://www.apple.com">8GB memory upgrade from Apple</a> direct will cost you $400. The lowest price for MacBook Pro RAM above is <del>$93.00 </del><strong>$59.99</strong> which makes it worthwhile in my opinion to shop around for the best deal on RAM upgrades for the 13 inch 2.7GHz MacBook Pro from Apple, as an over $300 savings is enough to buy an iPod or something else than spending unnecessarily on Apple memory upgrades.</p>

<p>**How to Upgrade MacBook Pro 2.7 GHz Memory<br />
**</p>

<p>Once you figured out what memory store to buy Apple MacBook RAM from, the next step is to install it yourself for even more savings on MacBook Pro RAM Upgrades as it’s easy to do and won’t void your limited warranty your new 2011 MacBook Pro comes with.</p>

<p>For even a greater deal on MacBook Pro RAM, you can trade in your RAM that came as standard memory on the 13 inch MacBook Pro and stores like <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/ramjet">RAMJET</a> and <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/OWC">OWC</a> will even pay you for your old ram which, if you do your homework will increase the savings you can see on MacBook Pro memory.</p>

<p>**How To Install MacBook Pro Memory for the 13 inch 2.7GHz Apple MacBook Pro **</p>

<p>This particular Macbook Pro model, which applies to all 2011 Apple MacBook Pros all can accept up to 8GB of memory using DDR3 1333Mhz so-dimms in the two memory upgrade slots available for upgrade. This means that you’ll have to remove the factory Apple RAM (and sell it or trade it for maximum savings) and buy and install an 8GB memory upgrade kit which consists of two 4GB ddr3 1333Mhz memory upgrade modules.</p>

<p>Once you have the new and bigger ram for MacBook Pro ready to go, all you need now is to do the MacBook Pro RAM upgrade yourself and it’s <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1270">super easy to do so</a> with just a philips screwdriver and a bit of common sense.</p>

<p>On the 2011 Apple MacBook Pro’s you remove the entire MacBook Pro bottom that covers the memory upgrade slots and you’ll see the memory upgrades right there underneath the cover where you can easily access the MBP’s ram upgrade slots for easy access.</p>

<p>I have already supplied <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1270">MacBook Pro RAM upgrade instructions</a> for the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/apple-macbook-pro-13-inch-2-3ghz-memory-upgrade-prices/" title="Apple MacBook Pro 13 inch 2.3GHz Memory Upgrade Prices">cheaper 13 inch MacBook Pro</a> so I won’t repeat myself again, but I will express that static electricity is the enemy when it comes to memory upgrades so please pay attention to the instructions on <strong>how to install Macbook Pro RAM supplied by Apple</strong> for the proper way to discharge static electricity from yourself before you go touching sensitive memory parts.</p>

<p>**13 inch 2.3 GHz  Apple MacBook Pro RAM Upgrade Prices<br />
**</p>

<p>The newest Apple MacBook Pro and also the <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/buying-a-macbook-pro-whats-the-best/" title="Buying a MacBook Pro: What’s the Best?">cheapest MacBook Pro</a></strong> Apple has released this year could benefit from a memory upgrade, despite the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26x%3D0%26ref_%3Dnb_sb_noss%26y%3D0%26field-keywords%3Dmacbook%2520pro%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">cheap price the smallest MacBook Pro is available for</a>. Out of the box, the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/2011-apple-macbook-pros-announced/" title="2011 Apple MacBook Pros Announced">Apple MacBook Pro 13 inch 2.3GHz model</a> comes with a fast dual core Intel core i5 processor 4GB of DDR3 1333Mhz memory installed as factory default when it comes to MacBook Pro RAM configuration, that, while enough for running the operating system and some i Apps, such as iLife, iPhoto, and iMovie – <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/cost-of-4gb-ram-memory-for-macbook-pro/" title="Cost of 4GB RAM Memory for MacBook Pro">4GB of MacBook Pro RAM </a>in 2011, really isn’t that much memory and you really should <strong>upgrade the 13 inch MacBook Pro 2.3 Ghz model to double the installed memory</strong> – if not more, if your budget will allow</p>

<p>With 16 GB MacBook Pro RAM now readily available <em>(but still pricey – 16GB MacBook Pro memory costs as much as the MacBook you’re installing into the 16GB ram option for MacBook Pro, this is still not really a viable option for most of us looking for a good deal on MacBook Pro memory for the new 13 inch MacBook Pro)</em></p>

<p>The <strong>8GB 13 inch MacBook Pro memory upgrade option</strong>, with street prices of under $100 is a much more affordable and possible memory upgrade when it comes to RAM in the Apple MacBook Pro models.</p>

<p>**MacBook Pro Memory Upgrade Trade In Options<br />
**</p>

<p>What makes a <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/cost-of-memory-for-2011-apple-macbook-pro/" title="Cost of Memory for 2011 Apple MacBook Pro">deal on MacBook Pro memory</a> even better is that you can sell, or trade in your factory installed RAM from your 13 inch MacBook Pro and get even a better deal on MacBook Pro RAM than the 13 inch MacBook Pro RAM Prices I list above when you buy RAM from <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/oempcworld">OEMPCWORLD</a>, <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/ramjet">RAMJET</a> and <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/OWC">OWC</a> – just three Mac Memory stores that will happily take your Apple factory RAM as trade, <strong>saving you even more money on MacBook Pro RAM</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>13 inch 2.3 GHz Memory Upgrade Options</strong></p>

<p>Out of the box, the Apple 13 inch MBP running at 2.3 GHz, ships with <strong>4GB of RAM installed</strong> in the two memory upgrade slots the 13 inch MacBook Pro offers for upgrade so the only viable memory upgrade choices will be either 8GB or 16GB, and as you can see from the memory prices above it still costs a pretty penny to make 16GB MacBook Pro ram upgrades happen.</p>

<p>This leaves the <strong>8GB MacBook Pro Memory Upgrade Kit</strong> as your best bet for memory upgrades on the new 13 inch 2011 MacBook Pro model, and a number of memory stores offer these RAM upgrades for under $100, which a much more realistic price for a memory upgrade for any laptop computer – not just Apple MacBook Pro’s.</p>

<p>**How To Upgrade RAM on 13 inch MacBook Pro 2.3Hz<br />
**</p>

<p>Once you’ve decided on what MacBook Pro RAM to buy (and I leave that part up to you, some might want to save the most money you can on MacBook Pro RAM others prefer to buy name brand RAM) you can easily install the RAM on 13 inch MBP’s, or any MacBook Pro model that requires 1333Mhz sodimms for memory upgrades yourself, saving you even more money, as you don’t need to take in your MacBook Pro to the Apple Store or any other Authorized Dealer who will charge you for installing RAM.</p>

<p>The memory upgrade slots on the 13 inch MacBook Pros are easily accessible and with some safety precautions and a bit of common sense you can remove the MacBook Pro factory RAM, install newer, larger MacBook Pro memory modules and be rewarded with a faster, smoother running Apple notebook computer that can open more applications at the same time. Apple even shows you <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1270#link1">how to upgrade 2011 MacBook Pro RAM</a> all by yourself.</p>

<p>Essentially, all you have to do to replace or upgrade the RAM on the 13 inch 2.3 Ghz MacBook Pro is the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Remove the bottom case of the 13 inch MacBook Pro. There’s ten screws holding down the bottom cover that you need to remove and remember not to loose any of the screws, as you will need to re-install those ten screws when the ram upgrade is complete</li>
  <li>Discharge any static electricity you may have on you. RAM and static electricity  don’t mix. You may even want to buy an anti-static wrist strap for  a few dollars to be extra safe.</li>
  <li>Remove the factory RAM. There’s two little tabs, or wings that you spread apart to allow the MacBook Pro RAM to be removed. The RAM then pops up so you can grab it and pull it gently from the memory upgrade  slot.  First do this for the top memory slot and then again for the bottom memory slot.</li>
</ol>

<p>Then you just do the reverse to install the MacBook Pro memory upgrades with larger 4GB memory upgrade modules. The 1333Mhz sodimms only go in the MacBook Pro one way  thanks to a slot in the module yourself, so  you really can’t screw this up – line up the slot with the memory upgrade slot on the Macbook Pro and push until the ram upgrade is seated, and then click the MacBook Pro RAM back in so the little plastic tabs or wings lock it in place.</p>

<p>Replace the cover with with those ten screws you put away carefully, turn over your MacBook Pro and power it up and you’ll rewarded with a MacBook Pro with double the memory upgrades that Apple  installed at the factory, and you get to experience the full power hidden inside your 13 inch MacBook Pro 2.3HGhz</p>

<p>The Apple MacBook Pro 13 inch is the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26scn%3D565108%26redirect%3Dtrue%26ref_%3Dsr_nr_scat_565108_ln%26keywords%3Dwindows%2520pc%26qid%3D1302792487%26h%3Dc7bb7aa435747f968b60d8f3daa0430828b78469%26rh%3Dn%253A565108%252Ck%253Awindows%2520pc&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">best selling notebook today</a></p>

<p>You know, as we enter 2011 I’m beginning to wonder the same thing as for what I do here on ramseeker – <strong>could  my MacBook could easily be replaced by a much cheaper windows PC?</strong> I’ve had a notebook PC for a few years now where it’s served as an underused and underappreciated iTunes music server, but as recent as just last evening I began to wonder if I could do what I do on a much cheaper windows PC instead?</p>

<p>The  13 inch MacBook Pro is the <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26scn%3D565108%26redirect%3Dtrue%26ref_%3Dsr_nr_scat_565108_ln%26keywords%3Dwindows%2520pc%26qid%3D1302792487%26h%3Dc7bb7aa435747f968b60d8f3daa0430828b78469%26rh%3Dn%253A565108%252Ck%253Awindows%2520pc&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">newest and most popular notebook on sale</a></strong> today, so there’s lots and lots of Apple fans that would much rather pay for the Apple brand  and there are a few reasons why in the long term the <strong>Apple Mac might be the better buy</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>The Mac Operating System</strong></p>

<p>The Mac/PC ads that were so popular both on TV and online a few years back featuring Justin Lon and John Hodgman highlighted the advantages of the Apple software, and  when it comes to innovation I think Apple gets the nod. Apple tends to lead the way with newer technology than Windows. The Mac OS tends to be, admittedly from a Mac-centric perspective, more intuitive.</p>

<p><strong>More Built in Software</strong></p>

<p>Or maybe better designed built in software might be a better way to state this. The included apps such as iLife, Garage Band, iMovie and the like tend to get better over the years and are also upgraded every year. There’s also iTunes which is software not for downloading  and playing music but Apple computers tend to work seamlessly with other Apple products such as iPods and iPhones.</p>

<p><strong>The Mac is Virus Free</strong></p>

<p>Somebody’s  going to chime in on this I know, but I’ve never been wiped out by viruses in the many many years I have owned and loved Apple computers. This may be the deal breaker right here, as with Windows you have to add and renew expensive antivirus software programs to be virus free. My Apple Macs have always just worked from the day I took them out of the box to the days I have sold or upgraded my Macs. When it comes to Macs they just worked for me.</p>

<p>I guess it all comes down to  what you do and how important your computing needs are. If all you do is facebook and email, then any old windows PC and most smartphones today are up  to the task. With the Macs, you pay more up front  – as much as triple the costs of a windows PC,  but it’s my opinion you get a better built and thought out product that’s more intuitive to use. But the downside of this is you’ll pay for it up front, and if you don’t have the cash then perhaps you should consider <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26scn%3D565108%26redirect%3Dtrue%26ref_%3Dsr_nr_scat_565108_ln%26keywords%3Dwindows%2520pc%26qid%3D1302792487%26h%3Dc7bb7aa435747f968b60d8f3daa0430828b78469%26rh%3Dn%253A565108%252Ck%253Awindows%2520pc&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">buying a windows PC</a></strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Your Mac Will Tell You What Memory You Need.</strong></p>

<p>But, all joking aside it’s pretty easy to figure out what memory you need for your 2010 MacBook Pro (or any Apple computer, now that I think of it).You could always <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/contact">ask me</a>. <img src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p>In the top left corner of your Apple MacBook 2010 is a little Apple logo, that if you click it you will see a menu item called <strong>About This Mac</strong>. It’s the very first menu item you see when you select the Apple Menu, so it’s pretty easy to find. After you have selected the menu, up pops a window that looks similar to this:<br />
<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1713" title="Apple Menu " src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Screen-shot-2011-04-14-at-3.08.10-PM.png" alt="How to Find Mac Memory" width="311" height="385" /></a></p>

<p>On this menu, you will see that it will tell you what version of the Mac OS you are running,  what your processor speed is and how much and what type of speed memory you have already installed in your MacBook Pro. In my  case, I already have the maximum macbook memory installed as I’m typing this on  a 2008 MacBook Pro, and at the time, 4GB of RAM was a lot of memory (how times change)</p>

<p>The more info button will bring up the system profiler which will tell you that you’ve got two memory upgade chips installed and some other technical jargon that, in my opinion you don’t need – as you now have all the data you need – you know your MacBook Pro processor speed, memory type and speed and how much ram you already have installed.</p>

<p>Now all you need is to find a memory store that will help you find the right ram for your MacBook Pro. I’ve got a <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/where-to-buy-computer-memory-upgrades/" title="memory store list">great list of memory stores</a> here but for this example I will use <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">crucial technology</a></strong> as they offer fair prices on ram and  have an easy to use memory upgrade finder.</p>

<p>Off we go to <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">Crucial</a></strong>, where we select our Computer Manufacturer, Model Name, and processor speed  – all things your Mac already told you you have, and  you’re returned with information about your particular model such as memory type for your MacBook Pro (which we already know) and how many slots  and the maximum RAM your MacBook Pro can recognize, stuff we didn’t know.</p>

<p>If my MacBook Pro only had 2GB of RAM installed, I now know that I could max out my RAM on my MacBook Pro by replacing the 2x1GB memory upgrades with bigger memory modules, and  in this example that would be two 2GB memory modules for MacBook Pro which would maximize the RAM in my particular Apple MacBook Pro.</p>

<p>And once you have bought your MacBook Pro RAM Upgrade, it’s easy to install the MacBook memory yourself with common household tools that will not void your warranty. You can find how to upgrade your Apple RAM from Apple as <strong><a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1270" title="how to install apple ram">Macbook Pro Memory Upgrade instructions</a></strong> are included in the manual that came with your MacBook Pro.</p>

<p>It’s that easy to find the right memory for your MacBook Pro.</p>

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>I tend to pay more attention to the 2010 Apple iMacs, as that’s where you will get the most bang for your buck as the older iMacs might be so low in value that it’s not worth it to add more RAM to your iMac and you might be better off just selling your old iMac on eBay or Craigslist and buying a new iMac altogether if the memory upgrades end up costing you more than your Apple iMac is worth, it might be something to consider.</p>

<p><strong>Which iMac Do You Need To Buy Memory For?</strong>Where to buy iMac memory depends on many variables including whether you value the best price on ram you can get, or maybe you don’t mind paying more for iMac RAM and are willing to spend more on name brand ram, such as Crucial or Kingston RAM. But whatever you decide – cheap RAM for iMac, or the more pricier stuff – there’s one thing you have to determine first and that is:</p>

<p><strong>How To Tell What Apple iMac RAM You Need To Buy</strong></p>

<p>There’s many ways to do this and some <a href="http://www.memoryseller.com">memory sellers</a> even offer a small application you can download that will help you find the right iMac Memory you need, or if you know the speed of the computer you need to upgrade you may have enough info to use the memory configurator the ram stores offer.</p>

<p>One way to determine what RAM you need to buy for any Mac, and not just Apple iMacs is to use the good old Apple Menu to tell you: In the top left corner of your Mac is About This Mac, and when you select this menu item a window pops up that tells me what speed my current iMac is running at:</p>

<p>An example, although not an Apple iMac is my MacBook Pro which uses 1066 DDR3 SDRAM DIMMS:</p>

<p>You will see I am using a 2.4Ghz MacBook Pro that already has 4GB  of DDR3 RAM installed which is in this case, the maximum RAM I can run, but also  you now have the processor speed  and memory type and speed for your Apple computer.</p>

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>You know, these days almost – and the key word here is almost, any RAM you buy today for the iMac that meets the specifications f0r your Apple iMac will work and do the trick so you don’t really need a review on memory, as it either works or it doesn’t. There’s not a whole lot of gray when it comes to RAM (lots of gray market memory though, and you do want to stay away from memory stores that offer questionable RAM) as it either works just fine, or it doesn’t</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW">Kingston 8GB Memory Upgrade. The Best iMac RAM Today</a></strong></p>

<p><strong>How To Determine the Right iMac RAM To Buy</strong></p>

<p>Apple iMac RAM comes in many sizes from 1GB (actually 32mb and up, but any iMac worth upgrading today probably requires at least 1GB of RAM to run today’s Apple OS and Apple Applications smoothly) all the way up to 16GB on the 2010 iMacs, and look for even greater ram capacities on newer 2011 Apple iMacs that although they have not been released yet, will be sure to be here this summer or spring and my guess is they will take more than the 16GB maximum RAM that the iMacs currently run.</p>

<p>One of the easiest methods to determine the correct memory for your iMac is to use the Apple Menu to tell you both the processor speed of your current Apple iMac and also the speed the memory runs at, which for current 2010 (still current in 2011) Apple iMac is DDR3 SDRAM sodimms running at 1333Mhz.</p>

<p><strong>Apple iMac Memory Choices</strong><br />
[table id=2 /]</p>

<p>iMac memory –  regardless of brand name, or even where you buy it from, which I will get to in a minute comes in essentially two flavors. One, is the name brand ram and at time of writing this up Kingston RAM for iMac seems to be the best selling iMac memory you can buy today and 8GB will cost you under $100. But, there’s other choices too such as Crucial Memory, another well respected  iMac memory brand.</p>

<p>Or, if you want to save even more money  on RAM  you can buy Generic RAM from a **<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/where-to-buy-computer-memory-upgrades/">selection of memory stores</a> **that offer better prices on iMac RAM, s  these stores for the most part sell only Generic RAM. This RAM brand, or lack of brand really is still a tested high quality memory upgrade, but it’s made in house by  some memory stores,  or bought in bulk where the savings on ram upgrades can be passed on to you – the consumer. This type of RAM is cheaper as there is no logo or sticker on the memory  upgrade and in my experience ships in a small plain envelope which costs less than the fancy packaging the name brand RAM is supplied in.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>All RAM for iMac will work just fine, but at the  time I write this the best selling and most popular iMac memory upgrade is the <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW">8GB Kingston Brand DDR3 for Apple iMac</a></strong> memory upgrade kit priced under $100.</p>

		<div class="post-content"><p> </p>

<div style="float: right; margin-right: 5px;">
  It&#8217;s been said in the computing field there&#8217;s no such thing as too much ram or hard drive space, and it&#8217;s so true. As our need for both hard drive space and memory increases over the years (it wasn&#8217;t that long ago that 250gb of hard drive space was a big deal, as so was 1GB of memory upgrade space)
</div>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0039SM0AS/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0039SM0AS"><img title="Cheap Solid State Hard Drives" alt="Cheap Drives, Solid State.

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0039SM0AS/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0039SM0AS">Solid Sate Hard Drives for MacBook</a></strong></p>

<p>But times change and before you know it, the hard drive on your MacBook is full, or getting there thanks to the demands of modern computing such as MP3 and movie downloads , not to mention the bloated operating systems that despite the fact offer more speed and functionality and are much more intuititive than OS’s of before – these software programs take up a lot of space, and usually more space than what you what came with the hard drive installed inside your Apple notebook computer.</p>

<p><strong>MacBook Hard Drives are Cheap</strong></p>

<p>The good news is that not only are MacBook hard drives offer more capacity at less money than ever before, if you install your original factory hard drive in and external case (usually a USB case), then you now have an instant backup of your MacBook and in most cases – for traditional SATA hard drives, the hard drives cost under $100.</p>

<p>Another option when considering a MacBook hard drive upgrade is to keep your factory hard drive in an external hard drive case as mentioned before, but instead of buying a standard hard drive, buy a cheap solid state hard drive for startup files and regularly accessed files and use your original MacBook hard drive for stuff you don’t use as much.</p>

<p>**Cheap Hard Drives for MacBook. **</p>

<p>As the MacBook ships from Apple with a 250GB hard drive you, in my opinion at least want to double your MacBook hard drive space so starting with the **Western Digital Scorpion Blue 500GB internal SATA hard **drive that’s currently **<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001JSSDGU/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001JSSDGU"><strong>on sale for less than sixty dollars</strong></a> is a fantastic MacBook hard drive option, especially for the price. **</p>

<p><strong>If you want even more space than what the 500GB Western Digital drive offers, there’s also a 1TB version which offers four times the space, enough for more than enough data for your files and this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0034ZD5P0/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0034ZD5P0">notebook hard drive will cost just over $100</a></strong></p>

<p>**<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref_%3Dnb_sb_ss_i_0_22%26field-keywords%3Dsolid%2520state%2520hard%2520drive%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps%26sprefix%3Dsolid%2520state%2520hard%2520drive&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">Solid State Hard Drives</a> are one other option when it comes to more space for your MacBook but be aware that solid state technology is still new and therefore, quite expensive when you compare the prices to more traditional hard drives which can be had for much less. **</p>

<p><strong>To just match or replace the standard 250GB hard drive in your Macbook with a similar hard drive will cost you close to 1000 dollars – as much as the price of the MacBook itself. But if you need speed and portability over space then a SSD or solid state hard drive upgrade still makes sense and smaller size SSD hard drives can be bought for much less, making a MacBook solid state drive upgrade a worthy upgrade option for those in the market for more speed yet sacrifice on total space.</strong></p>

<p>Goodness Gracious, No.</p>

<p>Unless you have money to burn, I suggest you <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref_%3Dnb_sb_ss_c_1_12%26field-keywords%3Dapple%2520memory%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Delectronics%26sprefix%3Dapple%2520memory&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">buy memory for any Apple computer</a></strong> from **anywhere but Apple. **</p>

<p>There was a time when yes, you did have to buy Apple specific ram, but that was, oh, in the late ’90’s and for the last decade or so you don’t need to buy Apple branded memory and as long as the ram for your Apple computer meets Apple’s specific requirements – you’re good to go with a few caveats.</p>

<p><strong>Low Price <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26x%3D0%26ref_%3Dnb_sb_noss%26y%3D0%26field-keywords%3Dapple%2520memory%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">Apple RAM</a></strong></p>

<p>Depending on where or whom you end up buying Apple RAM from, you could either get the best deal on memory or the biggest headache going, and it all comes down to pretty much one thing and that’s customer service. If you’re not buying RAM from Apple and want to save money on RAM you’re probably looking at buying generic memory upgrades which tend to be the lowest priced memory you can buy today, and as long as the technical specs are OK with the technical specifications for memory as outlined in your <a href="http://www.apple.com/support/" title="apple support">Apple’s manual</a>, you’re good to go and can buy the cheap ram.</p>

<p>Where you might get into trouble when buying ram from third party memory stores is when it comes down to what store or memory reseller you buy memory  from, so to help you with a choice on where to buy ram  from vendors you can trust, I created a list of the <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/where-to-buy-computer-memory-upgrades/">best memory stores</a></strong> that I would deal with happily (and have).</p>

<p>As long as you stick to the stores on the list, (<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="apple memory">ram prices are here</a>), you’ll be just fine and  you can get the best price on RAM upgrades for Apple, and pay far less than what Apple would charge you for the same ram upgrades.</p>

<p><strong>A bit more expensive, but still cheaper than Apple when it comes to memory upgrades.</strong></p>

<p>If the thought of <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="buy ram">buying RAM</a> from the stores I  list give you the heebie jeebies, but you still want to save money but don’t mind paying for a better quality product than generic memory can offer, you would be worse  off than to buy either <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW">Kingston RAM</a></strong> or <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">Crucial Memory</a></strong> –  two name brand manufacturers that not  only make the ram , but sell and support the Apple memory upgrades you buy too.</p>

<p><strong>Name brand RAM</strong> is still cheaper than what Apple charges, and yet you will get a high quality memory product that’s priced far, far less than what Apple charges.</p>

<p>Well, it’s no secret that I’m a <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/Apple">fan of Apple computers</a> and have been for some time, but in the last decade PC computers have dropped in price not just with notebooks and desktops,but with netbook computer too, which are the cheapest computers you can buy and easily be found for less than two hundred dollars from jus about every notebook PC manufacturer except Apple, which some will say charge too too much for their products when you can buy computers from other PC brands for less.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I"><img class="alignnone" title="best computer brand" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Screen-shot-2011-04-09-at-4.17.40-PM.png" alt="" width="298" height="232" /><br />
</a><br />
All other PC brands rely on the Windows OS to operate and for some, this could either be an advantage or a curse, depending on your perspective. For my case,  I prefer the Apple OS for one reason only, and that’s the fact that I grew up with the Mac OS  and  when using the windows OS, it confuses me to no end but the same could be same for the Mac OS. One good thing about the Windows OS is that for some of us, there’s a Mac software  version for popular Mac applications that will run on the Windows OS.. Safari and iTunes both come with versions that will run on Windows OS just fine.</p>

<p>If all you’re doing with your PC is web browsing and itunes, you can now do these things on about every smartphone built today so some might argue why bother with the Mac OS when a much cheaper brand of computer will do just fine. I know in my household, I’m a Mac obviously  but my significant other can’t fathom of paying a premium for an Apple computer when a perfectly fine notebook to her runs the windows OS  and saves her money in the process?</p>

<p>Regardless of what side of the Mac/PC fence you  sit on, the <strong>top ten computer brands to buy</strong> today are:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Apple</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Toshiba</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Asus</strong></li>

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>One other place where you’ll be paying more for memory is if you want to <strong>upgrade a Mac Pro,</strong> this ram is not the <strong>cheapest RAM for Apple computers</strong> and at the time of writing, <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/Mac_Pro_RAM_Upgrade_Kits_DDR3_1333_with_8GB_RAM-64gb/" title="mac pro 64gb ram prices">64GB for Apple Mac Pro is still a pretty pricey proposition</a>.</p>

<p>That’s how much it costs to add ram to a Mac computer, or Apple Macintosh Computer as they are formally known, and as I have said above adding memory to almost any Mac computer is a pretty good deal. A few exceptions right now will be 16 GB for MacBook Pros, which are still pretty pricey and can cost as much as buying a new MacBook Pro costs in the first place. I’ve yet to have the opportunity to test a MacBook Pro with 16GB and I’m doing just fine on 4GB in a MacBook Pro, and have for a few years now so this just goes to show you that if you’ve got 4 to 8GB of memory installed, you have more than enough RAM installed already. In fact, there’s one website that’s dedicated to <a href="http://www.lowendmac.com" title="low end mac">helping you get more out of your older Mac</a>, negating the need to buy ram or a new Mac at all.Cheap, Cheap, Cheap.</p>

<p>But for most other Macs, especially consumer macs for everyday use – or ‘lifestyle’ computers as they are sometimes known –  RAM upgrades are a really good deal right now and 8GB notebook ram, not just for Apple Notebooks too, is <strong>priced under $100</strong>.</p>

<p>This <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">cheap $100 ram upgrade</a> for both notebooks and desktops that Apple makes maxes out you RAM for both the MacBook Pro and Apple iMac two of the best selling computers Apple makes today, and at time I write this <strong>you can use the same memory in both iMacs and MacBook Pros</strong>.</p>

<p>**Where to get the best deal on Mac RAM today? **</p>

<p>The <strong>cost of 4GB RAM memory upgrades</strong> my friends is the sweet spot of ram upgrades currently in 2011 when it comes to <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW">buying RAM for your MacBook Pro</a></strong>.</p>

<p>The 16GB MacBook Pro RAM is still too pricey to really pay attention to unless you have deep deep pockets or really really need the extra performance. I have yet to test 16GB for MacBook Pro, but it only makes sense that MacBook Pros will run faster with double the RAM that Apple states as the maximum, which is 8GB of RAM.</p>

<p>This is why 4GB of RAM for MacBook Pros are the most popular memory modules for MacBook Pros today, and that’s because of the fact that 4GB RAM price for MacBook Pro continue to drop over time, and buying two of them will fill your MacBook Pro and this applies to both the Apple MacBook Pros made in 2011, and  just released a month or so ago, and the later MacBook Pros with the latest refresh being in the spring of 2010.</p>

<p><strong>MacBook Pro RAM Types</strong></p>

<p>The new MacBook Pros announced Feb 24, 2011 take different memory upgrades than what is available or was available for the older 2010 MacBook Pros, so unfortunately, you cannot take the ram from your 2010 MacBook Pro with you and install  it in your new 2011 MacBook Pro – You will have to buy new 4GB ram upgrades for the new MacBook Pros, as they require 4GB DDR3 1333MHz SDRAM so-dimms, while the older MacBook Pros ran on 4GB DDR3 1066Mhz SDRAM so-dimm and the two are not interchangeable.</p>

<p><strong>4GB MacBook RAM Memory Prices</strong></p>

<p>The good news is that if you fill your MBP with 2x 4gb RAM modules, you can do so at a cost of under $100 currently and  in some cases, less as some stores like OWC and OEMPCWORLD will buy back the factory installed memory upgrades that were in your MacBook Pro reducing the price of your MacBook Pro RAM to even less..  There’s no reason to spend more than $50 for a 4GB Apple MacBook Pro Memory Upgrade. Below are the best deals you can find  on Apple 4GB MacBook Pro RAM today for both newer and older MacBoo Pro models.</p>

<p>This one’s easy, as when we’re talking about MacBooks and <strong>not MacBook Pro’s or Airs</strong>, there’s only one MacBook currently on sale that you  can buy and that’s the 2.4GHz Apple MacBook in white with a MSRP of $999. (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002C7489S/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002C7489S">you can do better on the price</a>)</p>

<p><strong>MacBook White 2011 2.4GHz </strong>(<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002C7489S/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002C7489S">see lowest price</a>)</p>

<p>Now if it were my choice and you don’t need to save every penny to <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002C7489S/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002C7489S">buy a MacBook</a></strong>, I would do all I can and <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I">buy  the MacBook Pro</a></strong> instead in the same 13.3 inch format as the MacBook but adds a whole lot more features when you compare the two side by side. On the new MacBook Pro there’s a <strong>faster processor, more RAM capability and the new Thunderbolt technology</strong> that will be the defacto standard when connecting other devices sooner than you’d think.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1651" title="Best MacBook Ever" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Screen-shot-2011-04-03-at-4.25.22-PM.png" alt="Best MacBook To Buy Today" width="298" height="243" /></a></p>

<p><strong>13 inch MacBook Pro: Best of  All MacBooks</strong> (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I">click to see price</a>)</p>

<p>The MacBook is a nice computer, no doubt but with the last refresh being last year in May 2010, the MacBook is starting to show it’s age, especially when compared to the newer big brother. Unless you need to buy a much cheaper computer, I would stick with the MBP when shopping for a MacBook this year as the MacBook Pro’s are the newest and fastest MacBooks.</p>

<p>Let’s compare:</p>

<p><strong>Processor</strong></p>

<p>MacBook: 2.4 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo</p>

<p>MacBook Pro: 2.3GHz dual-core Intel Core i5</p>

<p><strong>RAM</strong></p>

<p>MacBook: 2GB standard, up to 4GB allowed</p>

<p>MacBook Pro: 4GB standard, up to 8GB allowed (16GB, according to <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/OWC">OWC</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Graphics</strong></p>

<p>MacBook:NVIDIA GeForce 320M graphics processor with 256MB of DDR3 SDRAM shared with main memory</p>

<p>MacBook  Pro: Intel HD Graphics 3000</p>

<p><strong>Storage</strong></p>

<p>MacBook: 8x superdrive, 250GB Hard Drive</p>

<p>MacBook Pro: 320GB Hard Drive, 8x SuperDrive</p>

<p>**I/O interfaces **</p>

<p>MacBook: USB 2.0</p>

<p>MacBook Pro: USB 2.0, FireWire 800, ThunderBolt  Port</p>

<p>As you can see, for the added $200 expense the 13 inch 2.3GHz MacBook Pro is the winner here as it adds the same clock speed, (close enough)  but with a much faster Intel processor.</p>

<p><strong>Lightest MacBook</strong></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Screen-shot-2011-04-03-at-4.29.46-PM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1653" title="Lightest MacBook of All" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Screen-shot-2011-04-03-at-4.29.46-PM.png" alt="Best Small Apple Notebook 2011" width="297" height="247" /></a></strong></p>

<p>**MacBook Air. The lightest MacBook **(<a href="a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0047DVRQW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0047DVRQW">click for best price</a>)</p>

<p>And just to make things even more confusing there’s the <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0047DVRQW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0047DVRQW">MacBook Air</a></strong>, which for those needing the smallest and lightest Apple notebooks, this is the choice you’re looking for. The upside with the MacBook Air is the weight of course, weighing just 2.3 lbs, the 11 inch MacBook Air is the lightest notebook you can buy and they start the same as the white MacBook’s do at $999.</p>

<p>The MacBook Air is stripped of a lot of stuff in order to make it the cheapest and lightest MacBook. Gone are the hard drive and optical drive. For the optical drive, you can buy an extra optical drive that plugs into the MacBook Air. If you need an optical drive, I would  suggest you buy a MacBook white  instead as I see no point in trying to slug around a CD drive, as it negates the portability of the MacBook Air in the first place.  Another thing gone on the MacBook Air is the hard drive, which instead is replaced with  a 64GB or 128GB hard drive depending on the configuration of MacBook Air you buy. There’s also a 13 inch MacBook Air, but I think for any serious work, the 1.4GHz Intel Core 2 processor is back in time, even if the SSD hard drive speeds  up read and writing of data.</p>

<p>So. If you really, really need the lightest Apple notebook you can buy, then <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0047DVRQW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0047DVRQW">grab the MacBook Air</a></strong>, but the best selling and best deal when it comes to MacBooks in 2011 is currently the <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I">Apple MacBook Pro 13 inch</a></strong> and with some shopping around for the best price can be had closer to the $999 list price of the white MacBook than you would believe.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I">Buy the 13inch MacBook Pro </a></strong>as currently, it’s the <strong>best MacBook of  the bunch</strong>.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2011/04/best-2011-notebook-computer-brands/">Best Notebook Computer Brands and Best Selling Laptops</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>Well, we all know I’m a big fan of <a href="http://www.apple.com">one particular computer brand</a> but there’s others. But not everybody drinks the koolaid and is willing to pay the premium that my favorite computer brand and there’s lots of other brands from major manufacturers of best selling notebooks in 2011. When you’re in the market for a new notebook computer you you’ve got more than one brand choice when you’re shopping for the best selling laptops 2011 has to offer so far.</p>

<p><strong>The Apple MacBook Pro is the best notebook Apple makes</strong></p>

<p>If you haven’t figured this out by now, I am a tad bit biased when it comes to shopping for a new notebook, but lots of you aren’t willing to pay the premium when it comes to the price that Apple demands for their laptops and with their lowest priced or cheapest laptop costing you at least $999 for the best price on a brand new Apple notebook, that’s a lot of coin for some of us (me too) and much cheaper Windows 7 notebooks are available for under $200 if you do a bit of online shopping.</p>

<h2 id="toshiba">Toshiba</h2>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>Best Toshiba Notebook. About half the price of the Apple notebook above.</strong></p>

<p>Toshiba to me, although perhaps not as well know  as HP or Dell, always seemed to me to make a superior product in my limited knowledge when it comes to Windows OS PC Brands. I have had a few opportunities to shop for a windows notebook, because even though I’ve confessed my love for Apple,  theree’s some things the Mac OS can’t do, and I’ve never had good look running Parallels, software that lets yuu run windows on your Mac and prefer  to just buy a PC notebook and the Toshibas always tended  to look like a higher quality  PC to my admittedly  untrained knowledge when it  comes to notebooks.</p>

<p>And this is where Windows PC’s just beat Apple hands down, and that’s price. Where the best selling notebook from Apple has a street price of about $1100 or maybe a bit more, the most popular Toshiba notebook  sits with a street price of  just over $500, or half the price of the Apple notebook above.</p>

<h2 id="acer">Acer</h2>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>Cheapest Acer Notebook Today</strong></p>

<p>Acer, when compared to Toshiba is a relatively newer notebook  manufacturer (please correct me if I’m wrong), at least when compared to the bigger brand names of  notebooks such as Apple or HP or Dell, but one thing that Acer, and to an extent all makers of notebook computers is price. When compared to the Apple notebook  above, the best selling acer notebook can be had for under $400 online. That’s one third the price of the  Apple MacBook Pro, and depending on your needs you might be better off buying two acer notebooks with one for work and one for  home still costing you  less than what Apple charges.  For $400, you can’t really compare when it comes to performance but for light computing needs an Acer Computer would do just fine.</p>

<h2 id="hp">HP</h2>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>One of the Better Notebooks from HP This Year</strong></p>

<p>Hewlett Packad is a very well known computer maker, not just of latpop computers, but desktop computers, printers in both inkjet and laser format and a host of  other electronics including digital cameras and more. HP have  done really well to brand  themselves as more of a higher end computer maker and although the do make cheaper notebooks they really shine lately when it comes to entertainment PCs as the line between computer and TV are getting more and more blurry. Once, just used for word processing and desktop publishing, modern HP notebooks in 2011 feature stereo built in speakers, fast graphics for video and  in some models, even a remote control is included in the price.</p>

<h2 id="dell">Dell</h2>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>Dell Inspiron is on of the cheaper notebooks made by Dell.</strong></p>

<p>Dell can offer lowest prices on notebooks as this was one of the first computer brands to ship direct to the consumer and although in 2011 there are a few exceptions, your Dell notebook comes straight from Dell, eliminating any costs that resellers add  to notebook computer. This results in some of the cheapest notebooks available today. Over the years Dell has grown to sell everything from dell branded HDTV’s to desktop computers, but some of the core reasons to shop for a dell is for their affordable inspiron notebooks like the 15 inch dell notebook on sale pictured above.</p>

<div style="float: right; margin-right: 5px;">
</div>

<p>Very carefully.</p>

<p>In some ways I joke because as long as you <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3918">follow the instructions</a> on iMac 27 inch RAM upgrade instructions as provided by Apple that won’t void your warranty in any way and make your iMac run faster for cheaper than you have ever imagined you’ll be absolutely fine as adding iMac 27 inch RAM isn’t complicated or difficult at all.</p>

<p>On the other side of the coin, adding memory to you Mac does require some precautions as there is a slim chance you could zap not only the RAM upgrade you’re trying to install but your Apple iMac too, and that my friends, is not a good idea or something I recommend. The biggest precaution you have to make when it comes to iMac RAM upgrades is to fight against static electricity when installing the memory.</p>

<p>As you will see with the Apple Memory Upgrade Installation  Instructions, upgrading RAM on the 27 inch iMac is pretty easy and once you remove the cover on the bottom of the iMac you have full access to the memory upgrade slots that can accept up to 16GB of RAM using four 4 GB DDR3 SDRAM 133 MHz sodimms.</p>

<p>It’s just a matter of removing the factory RAM from the iMac, which is usually formatted in 2x2GB or 2×4 GB memory configurations and installing more memory in the empty two upgrade slots on the 27 inch iMac. If your iMac came shipped with 8GB of RAM in a 2x4GB configuration, this means you have two more empty memory upgrade slots where you can buy and install another two 4GB imac memory module and effectively doubling and maximizing the RAM your iMac uses.</p>

<p><strong>Where to Buy iMac 27 inch RAM</strong></p>

<p>I monitor ram prices for Apple iMac 27 inch computers from a variety of memory manufacturers and vendors so  I suggest this to be a good place to start when shopping for deals on iMac RAM as the other thing you have to be aware of is paying too much money for you iMac RAM as you  have worked hard for that money and you want to maximize not only the iMac’s RAM but also the savings on RAM.</p>

<p>With that in mind, below are the cheapest Apple iMac 27 inch memory upgrades on sale currently:</p>

<p>[table id=2 /]</p>

<p>Memory Installations on the Apple 27 inch iMac are cheap and easy to do yourself with common sense and household tools and will make your iMac computing experience a joy for years to come.</p>

<p>What is the best computer 2011? (I also get asked what is the best 2011 laptop too)</p>

<p>I get asked this a fair bit, probably just behind what the best computers 2011 offers and what should I buy which is another thing I get asked, so rather than answer this question again privately,  I thought  I would answer your question here and look at the Top 3 HP desktop computers on sale and why they are the best desktops from HP you can buy this year to date:<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004G5ZTJW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004G5ZTJW"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1613" style="border-style: initial; border-color: initial;" title="Best HP Desktop" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-31-at-2.03.19-PM.png" alt="Cheapest HP Desktop " width="504" height="468" /></a></p>

<p>The HP Pavilion currently tops the best selling HP desktops list as it balances the low price that all desktop PC’s are associated with when compared to days gone by but still offers the best performance of any other desktop computer by HP. Featuring an AMD Phenom II 840T Quad-Core Processor with 6GB of RAM standard (expandable to 16GB), a 1TB hard drive for more than enough room for your files, and Windows 7 64 bit operating system installed with a fast ATI RadeonTM HD 4200 integrated graphics card  that offers fast and responsive video – great for movies or gaming, just two applications that require the fastest video card money can buy. Priced at just a touch over $500 this is the best value desktop from HP available today.</p>

<p>The HP Pavilion Slimline S5710f  comes in a much smaller form factor than a full sized PC but don’t let the small size or even smaller price fool you.

<p>The HP Pavilion P6750 Special Edition is priced with a street price of just over $500 and offers a stylish ocean inspired design for spaces where it matters that your desktop looks as much as it performs.

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-31-at-3.51.55-PM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1621" title="Best Deal on AppleCare" alt="Cheap Apple Care " src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-31-at-3.51.55-PM.png" width="304" height="329" /></a></p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>MacBook Pro Applecare. </strong></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004R6NWBC/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004R6NWBC">Save on AppleCare for MacBook Pro. </a></strong></p>

<p>This is a good question, and at $250 for another 2 years of limited warranty and almost 3 years of phone support some may argue that AppleCare is the best value no nonsense Apple warranty you can buy, while others might tend to think it’s the biggest waste of money possible and you would be much better off self insuring your new MacBook Pro yourself.</p>

<p>First off, let’s forget about the telephone support as I think for a professional notebook buyer this is waste of time. You’re buying a pro notebook  from Apple  so I’m going to assume you know how to use the thing, or at very least you know how to use the tools with your MacBook Pro whether  they are Adobe Photoshop  for graphics pros or Microsoft Office for business professionals, it’s highly unlikely you’ll use the phone support. At least I never have and with  every new Mac I have ever bought, I just unwrap or unbox the Mac and get to work.</p>

<p>The limited warranty is the kicker I think.  On  one  hand you could argue that the one year warranty that ships with every Mac is more than enough for finding out if you’ve got a dud of a Mac as that’s a year of bumps and bruises and reboots and restarts and there is going to be a problem with your new Apple notebook, it would have reared it’s ugly head by now.</p>

<p>On the other side of the argument, $250 for another 2 years of warranty is a pretty good deal and assuming this is a business computer the AppleCare might be considered a cost of doing business resulting in tax writeoff or refund and even if it isn’t in your case, ten dollars a month for Apple Warranty seems like a pretty good deal for the additional warranty and when you consider that AppleCare only adds another ten percent to your total MacBook Pro cost, give or take – the AppleCare for MacBook Pro seems like a no brainer.</p>

<p>I’ve never bothered with AppleCare for MacBook Pro, as even though a MacBook Pro should get you through three years  or so before you start lusting for a faster Mac, I tend to just trade my old MacBook Pro in for a newer  Mac notebook. My approach is this:</p>

<p>New MacBook Pro Price: $2500.</p>

<p>MacBook Pro traded in a year later for $1000.</p>

<p>This means I now have a $1000 credit for my brand new next generation MacBook Pro with another year  of AppleCare warranty included without having to buy AppleCare ever. Yes, it costs me $1500 for the year I have the current  MBP, but  I earn much more money with my MacBook Pro than $100 or  so a month, so I don’t care and I get a new MacBook Pro every year without having to buy additional AppleCare and  I would rather put the $125 a year to newer technology which allows me  to work even faster than before, another added benefit of this approach. Buying more insurance does not get my work done any faster.</p>

<p>Essentially, by opting out of buying AppleCare and just replacing my Mac every year when the warranty is up I have no need for AppleCare. The downside  of this approach is I’m losing $1500 per year (estimated) by doing this and keeping  my MacBook Pro for longer than a year would definitely be the more frugal choice, even with the added costs of Apple. Assuming I kept my MacBook Pro for three years – the same length of time as the AppleCare coverage and the MacBook Pro was entirely worthless at the end of those 36 month, my total yearly cost for my MacBook Pro, including the extended warranty of the AppleCare would be about $800 per year</p>

<p>If saving money on your computer purchases is your main concern, then AppleCare is the best deal as it allows you to extend the life of your MBP knowing you’ve got full limited warranty coverage from Apple. The downside to this is approach is that your Apple Notebook will be pretty slow when you compare it to newer models at the time.</p>

<p>If you prefer to use a new MacBook Pro year after year, then buying AppleCare for MacBook Pro is not worth it as it’s not needed. Every year when you buy a new MacBook Pro will come with AppleCare included. The downside to this method is you will be hit with high depreciation costs when it comes time to trade in your MacBook Pro at the end of the first year and your total computing costs will be significantly higher.</p>

<p>You have to decide what route suits your needs best when it comes to <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004R6NWBC/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004R6NWBC">buying extended warranty coverage for your Mac</a></strong>.</p>

<p>I can happily answer this question on <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/where-to-buy-computer-memory-upgrades/">where to get a good price on dell computer memory</a></strong> , but seeing as you didn’t specify whether you were looking for an upgrade on either your  Dell desktop computer or your Dell notebook, I’m going to hazard a guess and answer this as you were looking for <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">cheap 8GB for Dell notebooks </a></strong>as these notebook computers tend  to be the best selling computers you can buy from Dell in 2011.</p>

<p>Which <strong>Dell Notebook</strong>?<a style="line-height: 18px;" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004K1EQO6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004K1EQO6"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1588" title="Cheapest Dell Inspiron" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-30-at-2.53.23-PM.png" alt="Cheap Dell Notebook RAM" width="575" height="470" /></a></p>

</p>

<p>Now it’s time for me to ask questions. You didn’t tell me what computer model from Dell you specifically wanted  to upgrade when it comes to <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="dell memory upgrades">Dell memory upgrades</a> so let’s assume you want to upgrade one of the most popular Dell notebooks on sale that will accept 8GB of RAM. This  would be the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26scn%3D565108%26redirect%3Dtrue%26ref_%3Dsr_nr_scat_565108_ln%26keywords%3Ddell%2520inspiron%2520notebook%26qid%3D1301511039%26h%3Db229a1013fc0d38cc632a26a668c5de4f28c061c%26rh%3Dn%253A565108%252Ck%253Adell%2520inspiron%2520notebook&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">Dell Inspiron Notebook</a>, and though it ships standard from Dell with just <strong>4GB of memory installed in this Dell Notebook</strong>, the RAM can be  upgraded to 8GB effectively  doubling the RAM on this particular Dell notebook.</p>

<p>**Where to Buy Cheap Dell Memory Upgrades **</p>

<p><strong>**I have created a great list of all the memory stores you could buy memory upgrades for Dell computers from and these are all great places to **buy RAM for Dell computers</strong> (and many other computer brands too – not just Dell) . One of the best things about buying RAM from one of the vendors I list here is that you can be sure that all the <strong>RAM upgrades you buy for your Dell</strong> – 8GB or otherwise – will be that the <strong>total cost for Dell memory</strong> will be much cheaper thanks to the fact that Dell charges more for RAM in most instances than if you were to do a bit of shopping online and buy memory upgrades from a trusted memory source. The other reason is that with most <strong>memory stores specializing in Dell RAM</strong> you can save more money on RAM for Dells as you have the option to buy both the cheaper generic RAM for Dell, or if you prefer you can buy brand name  Dell memory upgrades but be aware that this  will cost you more than thew Generic RAM.  A few name brand memory manufacturers for Dell memory include <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">Crucial</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26scn%3D172500%26redirect%3Dtrue%26ref_%3Dsr_nr_scat_172500_ln%26keywords%3Dkingston%2520memory%26qid%3D1301510761%26h%3D6518adcfc6bf51d5edefa8705761def90a1da114%26rh%3Dn%253A172500%252Ck%253Akingston%2520memory&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">Kingston</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26x%3D0%26ref_%3Dnb_sb_noss%26y%3D0%26field-keywords%3Dcorsair%2520memory%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">Corsair</a>.</p>

<p><strong>It costs nothing to install memory if you install the  RAM yourself. </strong>For all but a few PC models  there’s no reason that with some common sense, a bit of research online for memory install instructions for your particular computer brand and model  and you can install ram yourself without the added expense of bringing your computer in to a computer store or computer service center.</p>

<p>When in comes time to install memory on a desktop computer or notebooks, most ram upgrade installations can be done in ten minutes or less with the biggest problem you may encounter when installing memory being static electricity as memory for both notebook and desktops tend to be fragile and very sensitive when it comes to static electricity.</p>

<p>All you need to do to prevent the memory or your computer against static electricity is to ground yourself properly either by touching a metal part on your computer chassis to discharge any electricity you may have built up in (or  is it on?) you.  A better defense against static is to <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref_%3Dnb_sb_ss_i_0_23%26field-keywords%3Danti%2520static%2520wrist%2520strap%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps%26sprefix%3Danti%2520static%2520wrist%2520strap&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">buy an anti-static wrist strap</a></strong> to ground yourself against any damage to your new RAM. This sounds like a big deal but in the 15 years I have been dealing with RAM I have never fried a stick of RAM using the precautions  I have mentioned.</p>

<p>Installing your memory upgrades depends on your particular model.  For an example,  <a href="http://support.dell.com/support/edocs/systems/ins1525/en/SM/memory.htm#wp1180987" title="dell memory installation">installing memory on a Dell 1525 Inspiron</a> notebook consists of nothing more than removing eight screws on the bottom of the Dell notebook to get at the memory upgrade slots, removing the factory RAM installed by Dell  and replacing them with the  larger memory modules that you have bought, and then simply fasten the door on the bottom of the notebook again.</p>

<p>Installing RAM on Apple Notebooks pretty much works the same: In the case of installing MacBook Pro memory you do <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1270#link1">pretty much the same </a>, except in the case of the Apple laptop you remove the entire bottom of  the laptop  instead of a small door on the back like you do with the Dell.</p>

<p>Desktop RAM installs are just as easy, if not more thanks to the fact that there’s more room to work with. Simply  unplug your desktop and all cables, remove the cover on your PC and lay the  PC chassis on it’s side where you will have easy access to the motherboard on your PC to access all the memory upgrade memory slots for your personal computer.</p>

<p>Tools required for memory installs usually just require a small philips screwdriver, or in rare cases a torx screwdriver and the anti static strap  mentioned earlier.</p>

<p>Short Answer: You’re better off just <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW">buying cheap MacBook Pro RAM</a></strong> than interchanging RAM upgrades.</p>

<p>The answer to the question on whether you can <strong>swap out the RAM from an Apple iMac to an Apple MacBook Pro</strong> depends on what specific <strong>Apple iMac</strong> and what specific <strong>Apple MacBook Pro</strong> you want to change or switch the memory from as all <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="macbook pro ram upgrades">MacBook Pro ram upgrades</a> are not the same as all <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/iMac_(DDR3_1333)/" title="iMac RAM Upgrades">iMac memory upgrades,</a> so you need to be very specific what exact Apple model you wish to perform this task with, as the  answer to this could depend:Yes or No.</p>

<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1580" title="Buy cheap MacBook Pro RAM" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-30-at-1.31.36-PM.png" alt="Buy RAM for MacBook Pro " width="310" height="218" />I  guess my first question is considering the <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="cheap apple memory">cheap price of Apple Memory</a></strong> these days and that for both the <strong>Apple iMac and the MacBook Pro RAM is so cheap</strong>, why don’t you just <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory">buy more Macbook Pro memory</a></strong> and be done with it. As I see it, you want to <strong>remove RAM from Apple iMac</strong> and <strong>Install RAM on MacBook Pro</strong> but my question is <strong>why</strong>?</p>

<p>This will leave you with an <strong>Apple iMac with too little RAM,</strong> or at very least not enough ram or less RAM than you had  before in the iMac and  <strong>more RAM in the MacBo0k Pro</strong>. I don’t recommend this and really except for  a few rare instances (16GB for MBP)  and bigger ram upgrades for Mac Pro – all <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/news/apple">Apple memory upgrades</a></strong> should for the most part ship for under $100 for 8GB of RAM which not the maximum RAM on either machines, sounds to me like a better idea than what you’ve got planned.</p>

<p>But yes (<strong>again, I don’t recommend this.  Do so at your own risk..etc</strong>) if you want to or need to <strong>swap RAM from an iMac to MacBook Pro</strong> you can, but you have to pay attention to the speed of memory in both machines. In the case of the <strong>latest iMacs which were announced summer 2010</strong> and the MacBook Pros just announced last month, these two do accept DDR3 SDRAM sodimms that could (have I mentioned I don’t recommend this?) be swapped from an iMac to a MacBook Pro.</p>

<p>You’re much better off <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW">buying new RAM for the MacBook Pro</a></strong> and leaving the  RAM inside the Apple iMac</p>

</div>

<p>Oddly enough, if you’re in the market to buy a a new MacBook, if  you want to get a good deal on a MacBook you can do much better on  the price if you <strong>do not buy  the MacBook from  Apple</strong> and  <strong>buy a MacBook from Amazon</strong> instead. When you buy the MacBook at the Apple Store you get to pay full list price for your MacBook, and in the age of the internet where **deals on Apple Macs **are just  a click away, why would you buy  a Mac from Apple when you can buy it less than the $999 MSRP somewhere else</p>

<p> </p>

<p>I like Amazon when <strong>buying Apple products</strong> as they offer bundles and special offers on not only your MacBook  but Mac accessories like Apple Displays, Mice, external keyboards and even <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/">MacBook RAM upgrades</a>.<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1600" title="Cheapest MacBook " src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-30-at-5.31.00-PM.png" alt="Best Price MacBook" width="303" height="243" /></p>

<p>At the time I write this, Amazon offers a **MacBook Bundle **that consists of the MacBook at a discount, but also Microsoft Office and AppleCare for your Macbook is also offered at a much cheaper price than had you bought the MacBook Pro.</p>

<p>Apple does offer refurbished MacBooks for less than what you would pay for a new MacBook, but you are not  buying a new MacBook but pre-owned MacBook or refurb, which might be a better price than a new MacBook, you might be buying problems rather than a deal, whereas if you stick with a new MacBook that’s priced well under the $999 MSRP from Apple you deal with what is probably one of the better vendors online regardless of what manufacturer you want, not just Apple.</p>

<p>Of course, when it comes time to get the <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_(1066_DDR3)/">best price on RAM for your new Apple MacBook</a></strong> you’re already at the right place, and I can recommend many memory sellers that can offer deals on Apple RAM too.</p>

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>[table id=1 /]</p>

<p>But I’m going to assume that when you ask what the <strong>difference is between 4GB of RAM for MacBook Pro and <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_Pro_DDR3_1333Mhz_Memory_Upgrade_Kits-8gb/">8GB of MacBook RAM</a></strong> it’s due to the fact that you’re talking about the <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/">best prices for MacBook Memory</a></strong> and you want to know <strong>what RAM you should buy for your MacBook Pro</strong> and whether it’s worth the added cost to make the upgrade from 4GB  to 8GB, or if you really need to upgrade the MacBook Pro then <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_Pro_DDR3_1333Mhz_Memory_Upgrade_Kits-16gb/">16GB of MacBook Pro Memory</a></strong>, but this last option is still very pricey with a street price of $1600 – almost the same as the cost of the <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I">cheapest MacBook Pro</a></strong> – the Apple 13 inch MacBook Pro.<strong>4GB, Obviously.</strong></p>

<p>[table id=15 /]</p>

<p>As all <strong>currently shipping MacBook Pros</strong> come out of the box with 4GB of memory already installed you really can only consider the <strong>8GB Apple MacBook Pro Memory Upgrade Kits</strong> consisting of two 4GB DDR3 SDRAM 1333Mhz so-dimms to be the only upgrade option when it comes to <strong>uprading your MPB with more RAM</strong>.</p>

<p>When it comes to pricing differences between <strong>4GB for Apple MacBook Pro Memory</strong> the cost difference is about half and rather than tell you a price on <strong>MacBook Pro RAM,</strong> that will be outdated by the time  you read this article, I’ll show you instead as the ram prices for MacBook Pros below are constantly updated so you can always get the best price on Apple MacBook Pro memory upgrades:</p>

<p><strong>Best MacBook Pro RAM Prices</strong></p>

<p>A MacBook Pro RAM Upgrade is one of the cheapest, easiest upgrades you can perform on your professional Mac notebook and with 8GB RAM for MacBook Pro available for under $100, this is a pretty easy upgrade to consider. I recommend it.</p>

<p>Let’s use a <strong>13 inch MacBook Pro</strong> as an example, as it currently is the <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/best-notebook-computers-of-2011/" title="best selling notebook">best selling notebook</a></strong> – regardless of computer manufacturer, so there’s definitely a market not only for this article, but for cheap and good MacBook Pro RAM overall that’s much cheaper than what Apple charges for RAM. As I write this to double the RAM on a new MacBook Pro will cost you $400 for 8GB of  13 inch MacBook Pro Memory.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Compare that to third party memory stores where you can buy the same <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_Pro_DDR3_1333Mhz_Memory_Upgrade_Kits-8gb/">8GB MacBook Pro Memory</a></strong> for under $100.  I don’t know about you but I sure don’t have an extra $300 to spend for the priveledge of <strong>buying ram from Apple</strong> when I can buy pretty much the same memory for less, much less. <strong>75% savings off $400 for MacBook Pro RAM</strong> is nothing to sneeze at, and if I do feel the need to give Apple more money I can do so with the purchase of an <strong>iPod</strong> or even use the savings on Apple RAM towards an <strong>Apple iPad</strong>.</p>

<p>To be fair, the <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/cheapest-apple-macbook-pro-memory-upgrades/">cheapest RAM for MacBook Pros</a></strong>are going to come as <strong>generic RAM,</strong> And although  it’s not specified there’s a very good chance your new MacBook Pro will ship with name brand memory upgrades.  The last MacBook I bought had <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">Micron RAM </a></strong>installed at default, which even though it’s name brand still only  has a street price of about $100 or perhaps a bit over. You’ll be fine with RAM from third party memory stores that are established online RAM vendors who sell a <strong>quality generic RAM product</strong>.</p>

<p>Now the best part. You can <strong>install RAM yourself</strong> for any current and discontinued Mac and in the case of the current Macs adding RAM upgrades yourself will not void your Apple limited warranty and <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/cheapest-apple-macbook-pro-memory-upgrades/">Apple even provides memory upgrade instructions</a> that will help you with the task of a memory install yourself.</p>

<p>I see no reason to either buy RAM from Apple either online, or direct as the cost is very high compared to much <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW">cheaper Apple Memory upgrade options</a></strong></p>

<p> </p>

<p>Regardless of What MacBook Pro you decide on, you should buy more RAM as this is the best and cheapest MacBook Pro upgrade you can do.</p>

<p>This is a very good question, as with the release of the <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/2011-apple-macbook-pros-announced/" title="new Apple MacBook Pro">new MacBook Pros </a></strong>just over a month ago there’s some excellent choices as Apple now offers the <strong>MacBook Pro in many configurations</strong> that include different screen sizes, processor speeds and video card specifications too. Then, there’s the price on the <strong><a href="ttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I">MacBook Pros that start at just $1199</a></strong>. (this is a good deal, and only $200 more than a MacBook) and go all the way to <strong>$2499 for the 17 inch MacBook Pro which</strong> is the perfect choice for the desktop replacement.<a style="line-height: 18px;" href="ttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1484" title="Best Selling Notebook" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Screen-shot-2011-03-26-at-2.24.37-PM.png" alt="Best laptop" width="300" height="242" /></a></p>

  <strong><a href="ttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I">MacBook Pro models start at just $1199</a></strong>
</p>

<p>If you determine ‘<strong>best</strong>‘ to equal <strong>cheapest MacBook Pro</strong> then your MBP of choice is the <strong>thirteen inch  MacBook Pro</strong>, and for a lot of us this is the  only way we could afford a MacBook Pro  as the <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BNHM0C/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000BNHM0C">prices for 15 inch MacBook Pro models </a></strong>hover closer to the two thousand dollar mark which can be a lot of money for some of us and could be a big price to justify considering  you can buy a <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fbestsellers%2Felectronics%2F565108%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref_%3Dzg_bs_nav&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">best selling windows notebook</a></strong> for about one quarter of the cost.</p>

<p>I can’t really tell you what the <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/">best MacBook Pro</a></strong> is, as I have no idea what you value most. For some of us <strong>price is the most important factor</strong> and the 13 inch MBP is the best bet, yet for others <strong>all the screen real estate  and power they can squeeze out of  a MacBook Pro</strong> means you’ll be the most productive as possible and that means the 17 inch MacBook Pro is the perfect fit.</p>

<p>I  can tell you that currently the two <strong>best selling MacBook Pros</strong> are the lowest priced MacBook Pro – <strong><a href="ttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I">the 13.3 inch 2.3GHz</a></strong> model and another popular portable Mac is the <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BNHM0C/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000BNHM0C">Apple MacBook Pro 15 inch 2.0 Ghz</a></strong> as these two MacBook Pros are priced under $2000.</p>

<p>The  13 inch MacBook Pro is the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/best-notebook-computers-of-2011/">most popular notebook in 2011 </a> thanks to the price/performance ratio, whereas the 15 inch MBP is a <strong>best selling Mac notebook</strong> as it feels much bigger than the 13.3 inch model but is a more common screen size than the 17 inch MacBook Pro which can be still pretty bulky if you plan on actually using this MacBook Pro as your primary Apple Mac Notebook computer, in my opinion – as  beautiful as that big screen may be.</p>

<p>One other thing to think about is <strong>processor speed and graphics</strong>. Personally,  I  tend to do a lot of tasks where the computer is waiting for me, such as writing so I’m  plunking away quite happily on a <strong>MacBook Pro 2008</strong> Unibody model with <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_Pro_KITS_(1066_DDR3)-4gb/">4GB of RAM</a> and because  waiting a few more seconds for the wheel to spin is not a big deal. But if you plan on <strong>using your notebook for graphics or video</strong> than faster processors  and  video cards  just got a lot more  important and even if the cost of initial purchase  is going to be higher, you can benefit  from the  <strong>fastest notebook and get  more work done faster</strong>. In my particular case it’s going to take me the same time to type this on a  low end MacBook Pro than it is the fastest MacBook Prow money can buy.</p>

<p><strong>Buying a MacBook Pro.</strong></p>

<p>** <strong>When you’ve decided on what MacBook Pro you need to buy, you can **<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26x%3D0%26ref_%3Dnb_sb_noss%26y%3D0%26field-keywords%3Dmacbook%2520pro%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">get a much better MacBook Pro deal</a></strong> at Amazon  than anywhere else with discounts available on all Apple products and not just Mac portables when you buy online and in most cases you’ll avoid sales taxes which on two thousand dollar computers can add up to a fair bit of coin and be a <strong>significant savings</strong> regardless of what MacBook Pro you decide to buy.</p>

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>Now that we’ve got three months or so into the year 2011, I thought it might be a good time to stop and check out the best selling notebook computers in 2011 to date, as the best computer in 2010 can be nowhere to be seen a month or so later as new notebook models are announced two things happen. The first is that the now discontinued models of computers go on sale as the manufacturers want to clear the inventory  of older notebooks so that the only notebooks in the sales channel are the newly announced laptops.</p>

<div style="float: right; margin-right: 5px;">
</div>

<div style="float: right; margin-right: 5px;">
</div>

<p>This has always been this way and the best time to buy a notebook could be the day the new models are announced as yesterday’s new and modern laptop  is now on sale for much less money than the day before.  I have bought many an Apple notebook this way, and saved at very least about 10 percent, if not  more of deal on a MacBook Pro. The new MacBook Pro’s get released, and the older MacBook Pro’s go on sale. This technique only works if you  understand the needs for your personal situation as for some, saving money on notebooks might not be worth it and you’re best to buy the latest and new laptop instead.</p>

<p>Let’s have a look at what’s the <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fbestsellers%2Felectronics%2F565108%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref_%3Dzg_bs_nav&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">best deal and best selling notebook</a></strong> to date in 2011:</p>

<p>A decade or so ago, the idea of an Apple Computer being the best selling computer today in any format  – notebook  or  desktop, would be considered laughable with PC notebooks being the best sellers year over year, but over the years Apple has reversed their fortunes and now make  the best notebook you can buy today with the Apple MacBook Pro 13 inch model. Featuring a dual core Intel i5 processor running at 2.3GHz, this particular Apple MacBook Pro also holds the distinction of being the cheapest notebook from Apple you can buy in the MacBook Pro lineup. With this model, the Pro version of Apple’s notebook is within reach of most consumers and is priced just 20% more than the Apple MacBook, Apple’s consumer notebook.</p>

<p>As with all notebook releases, the MacBook Pro runs faster than it’s predecessors but also brings new technology to the Apple notebook arena in the form of Thunderbolt I/O Technology which is much faster than USB and even FireWire and the first Mac, notebook or desktop to feature this new high speed interface. More RAM, a 320 GB hard drive and a new FaceTime built in web camera round out what’ new on the MacBook Pro and why  it is the best selling notebook computer today.</p>

<p>One of the biggest reasons for the Toshiba Satellite L655-S5158 to take the number  2 spot is the fact that it’s one of the better value notebooks available today when it comes to price. For the MacBook Pro above, the discount is rather tiny when compared to this Toshiba notebook that comes in priced at half the price of the Apple Mac above.</p>

<p>Featuring a fast **2.53 GHz Intel Core i3-380M dual-core processor **with Intel HD graphics, and with the help of the Intel Hyper-Threading technology that allows you do two tasks at the same time resulting in even more productivity when working with this 15.6 inch Toshiba notebook computer.</p>

		<div class="post-content"><p><strong>Best iMac Memory</strong></p>

<p>Almost all memory stores online offer something that’s called a memory configurator which  is  really just a way to search for  the correct ram upgrade for your Mac. You do need to be aware that some memory stores sell memory upgrades for Apple by individual memory chip, while others market their memory upgrades a bit better and sell memory upgrade kits, something that in 2011 is required as I recommend you buy RAM in matched pairs regardless of whether it’s technically required or not.  With the fact that RAM is the cheapest it’s been, well, ever  – it makes no sense to me not to buy RAM that matches.The <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/" title="Best Mac Memory">Best Mac Memory</a> is sold by so many memory stores it’s hard to keep track of <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/where-to-buy-computer-memory-upgrades/" title="where to buy mac ram">memory stores</a>, let alone where to get the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="cheap ram">best memory prices</a> (I’ll come back to that in a minute or two) but first we need to determine what Apple Mac you specifically need to upgrade with RAM, as all memory does not work or is compatible with all Apple computers in 2011 so it’s a good idea to figure out what memory  you need to buy.<br />
**Cheapest Apple iMac<br />
**<br />
The Apple iMac comes in four different models: two Apple iMacs offer 21 inch LCD displays, while the other 2 feature 27 inch displays.  On the 21 inch iMac, processor speeds can start at 3.06GHz Intel Core i3, and then work upwards to 3.2GGzh and  3.2GHz Intel Core i3 while the 27 inch iMacs offer processor speeds of 3.2 GHz Intel Core i3 and lastly a quad core 2.8GHz Intel Core i5 processor being the fastest iMac you can buy today.</p>

<p>But regardless of what specific Apple iMac you choose to buy, they all require the same memory upgrades: 1333GHz DDR3 SDRAM so-dimms are on sale at the lowest prices from a variety of online memory stores and the best iMac RAM Prices are here:</p>

**<br />
The Apple Mac Mini only ships in one model, (well, OK, there’s the Mac Mini Server) but for the rest of us that want to upgrade the cheapest co<br />
mputer Apple sells than the standard Mac Mini, it is. The Mac Mini requires slower RAM than the Apple iMac and uses DDR3 1066 SDRAM so-dimms available from a variety of vendors, but again it’s recommended to buy Mac Min RAM in matched pairs by me. Mac Mini RAM is so cheap it’s not advisable to mix and match RAM for the Mac Mini and suffer the performance problems that may occur as a result. The Apple Mac Mini only ships with a mere 2GB of RAM, so an upgrade to 8GB for Mac Mini is recommended</p>

<p>**<a>Cheapest Apple MacBook</a><br />
**<br />
The MacBook from Apple is limited to only one MacBook model on sale currently- the 2.4GHz MacBook Intel Core 2 Duo, which ships with 2GB of RAM installed in the two MacBook memory upgrade slots available. The maximum MacBook RAM allowed on the 2011 MacBook is 4GB of RAM, which means you can, and I suggest you do, double your MacBook RAM. Like the other Mac models, I do suggest you replace the RAM in pairs, although technically you don’t have to, there’s very little performance increase in 3GB of RAM over 2 GB so you are much better off with upgrading all the way to 4GB of RAM for MacBook Pro.</p>

<p>MacBook Pro RAM is super cheap for DDR3 SDRAM 1066 so-dimms, the RAM you need to buy for the MacBook so even if you’re remotely considering a MacBook Upgrade, I suggest you do it.</p>

<div style="float: right; margin-right: 5px;">
</div>

<p>Wow.</p>

<p>This is some question and the two computers could not be any different if you tried. First, we’ve got the whole <strong>Mac vs. PC thing</strong> going on which I won’t get into as we all have our biases and for some it’s the initial or out of the box price that has to be lowest and yet other customers prefer to pay a bit more at the store for reduced headaches down the road.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8IO6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8IO6">Cheapest Apple iMac</a></strong></p>

<p>Then we’ve got the fact that the Apple iMac is a best selling desktop computer regardless of brand, and the fact that the HP ENVY 14 is not but is a very capable notebook computer that’s feature packed with all kinds of goodies such as Windows OS, Intel Core i5-480M Processor 2.66GHz with Turbo Boost Technology up to 2.93 GHz, 4GB DDR3 System Memory (2 DIMM) and a maximum of 8GB of HP Envy RAM and a 14.5 inch LCD display rounding out the main feature set of the HP 14. Street price is $999, but you can get a HP Envy 14 deal that’s less than that considerably (<strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8IO6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8IO6">see cheapest HP ENVY 14 price</a></strong>). One of the major advantages of the HP ENVY 14 is that you can take this computer with you thanks to the notebook design.</p>

<p>On the iMac side of things there’s the fact that the iMac, even the <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/">cheapest iMac you can buy</a></strong> – features a 21.5 inch LCD display for far more screen real estate than the 14 inch display on the HP ENVY. The downside being of course, whether you need portability as the Apple iMac, even though thanks to it’s all in one design could be considered portable, really isn’t. As far as specs, the iMac of course ships with the Mac OS so there’s that, but the the iMac uses a 3.06GHz Intel Core i3 processor and ships with 4GB of RAM, but can be expanded to 16GB of iMac memory. The list price on the Apple iMac is $1199, another $200 more than the HP ENV too. (<strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8IO6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8IO6">see cheapest iMac Price</a></strong>)</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8IO6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8IO6">Best Price on HP ENVY 14</a></strong></p>

<p>So as I see it, to decide whether to <strong>buy the HP ENVY 14 or the Apple iMac</strong> comes down to this:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Price</strong>. The iMac costs more.</li>
  <li><strong>Use</strong>. The HP envy is a notebook and the iMac isn’t.</li>
  <li><strong>OS</strong>. We won’t even go there.</li>
  <li><strong>Screen Size</strong>. The iMac wins.</li>
  <li><strong>Processor</strong>. The Envy offers a faster processor, but at a lower speed. This could be close in real world testing.</li>
</ol>

<p>The big variable when <strong>comparing the Apple iMac to the HP Envy 14</strong> is use, first and foremost. Forget, all the other variables such as the Mac and Windows, or even price and concentrate on what, and where you plan on using your computer. If you need to be out and about, the <strong>HP ENVY</strong> wins thanks to it’s portable notebook design, but if you need <strong>bigger screen real estate</strong>, and can live with an all in one desktop design the <strong>Apple iMac might be a better fit</strong></p>

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>It should come as no surprise that the first upgrade I am going to recommend you do is to <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">upgrade memory on your MacBook</a></strong>, as MacBook memory is so cheap, you can max out the ram on your MacBook for under $100, in fact – way less than that with a <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_KITS_(1066_DDR3)-4gb/" title="MacBook 4GB RAM Kits">4GB RAM Memory kit for Apple MacBooks</a> costing you <strong>less than $50.00 for 2×2 GB DDR3 SDRAM 1066 SDRAM sodimms</strong>. This total gets cheaper too if you sell your older or factory MacBook RAM that you pulled from your MacBook to make room for the newer, bigger, 2GB MacBook RAM chips. <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/ramjet">RAMJET</a>, <a href="http://www.macsales.com">OWC</a> and <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/oempcworld">OEMPCWORLD</a> are just a few memory stores that will <strong>buy back your old MacBook RAM</strong>.</p>

<p>Installing the RAM upgrade on your MacBook is easy too. Flip the MacBook over on it’s backside, remove the cover and battery, make sure you are well grounded as we don’t want to have any accidents when it comes to static electricity as the RAM memory you bought for your new MacBook, while cheap – doe not like static electricity at all. If you’re concerned about installing MacBook RAM yourself, just take the RAM and MacBook to an authorized apple dealer so you don’t void the warranty on you MacBook and for a fee, you can get the RAM installed without having to worry about static electricity. But I don’t think you need to take your MacBook in to get serviced and you can do it yourself. Just don’t wear a wool sweater with wool socks on a shag carpet  on the coldest day of winter to upgrade the MacBook RAM. Touch the MacBook’s metal parts such as the MacBook chassis and you’ll be fine as any static electricity you’ve been keeping will discharge. If you’re all concerned about upgrading the RAM on your MacBook, don’t be. Apple even says it’s OK for you to upgrade your own MacBook RAM and provides you with <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1651#link1">easy to use and follow instructions to do so</a>.  The result will be an upgraded MacBook running twice the factory installed 2GB of MacBook Memory.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004R6J2V6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004R6J2V6">MacBook  AppleCare Plan</a></strong></p>

<p><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">MacBooks come out of the box with a one year warranty, so unless you do something silly like, oh, drop the MacBook or spill coke all over the MacBook there’s a little chance you will need an extended warranty, right? But for the rest of us that use the MacBook like the small, durable portable it was designed to be and actually go outside with the MacBook and take it to school, office or your local starbucks it’s no a bad idea to buy AppleCare from Apple that offers extended warranty. You’re still hosed if you drop or spill on your MacBook as Apple did not design their consumer notebook to suffer that fate, but for the stuff that is considered a manufacturer’s defect wouldn’t you like to know you’re covered for longer than the original year that Apple includes for free with every $999 MacBook. </span></strong></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004R6J2V6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=rasmeeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004R6J2V6">AppleCare</a></strong> is a great deal and for just pennies a day, you’re insured for 3 years on both limited warranty, and the telephone support for your MacBook too. Out of the box, the MacBook only comes with 90 days support, but AppleCare gives you 3 years. The warranty allows you to take in your MacBook to any Authorized Dealer or Repair Center and applies not only to  the MacBook, but all the accessories too such as power adapters, RAM (this assumes your factory memory) and even the Apple Display if you bought it too at the same time as your MacBook.</p>

<p>All this is just $250 for two more years of limited warranty coverage from Apple and two years and 9 months of free MacBook telephone support compared to just the 90 days. The $250 price works out to another $125/year for the additional warranty coverage or ten dollars a month for MacBook to be covered in full for the three years. LCD displays are expensive. So are motherboards on your MacBook that might heat up and decide, nope  it’s not going to work anymore.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004R6J2V6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=rasmeeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004R6J2V6">AppleCare is a good deal</a></strong> if  you plan on keeping the MacBook longer than a year.</p>

<p><strong>Hard Drives</strong></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001JSSDGU/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001JSSDGU"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1507" title="MacBook 500GB Hard Drive" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-26-at-8.29.23-PM.png" alt="" width="250" height="306" /></a></strong></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001JSSDGU/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001JSSDGU">MacBook 500gB Hard Drive</a></strong></p>

<p>For a lot of us, this might not be an issue and the 250GB storage space the MacBook ships with will be more than enough for school papers, recipes, MP3’s or photos and audio files, but in 2011 there’s two ways that you could upgrade your MacBook with either a bigger hard drive, or much faster hard drive depending on what you use the MacBook for.</p>

<p>Hard Drive upgrades are available  from a variety of hard drive manufacturers and at very least you would want to double or even quadruple the hard drive space on the MacBook. The MacBook uses 2.5 inch  SATA notebook hard drives that on the Macbook are easy to replace or upgrade. At the time  I write this, <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001JSSDGU/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001JSSDGU">500GB notebook drives</a></strong> are available for about $50, and <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001JSSDGU/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001JSSDGU">1TB hard drives</a></strong> for MacBook run about $100 or so</p>

<p><strong>External MacBook Hard Drives</strong></p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018B5CA8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0018B5CA8">Lacie 500GB and 1TB External Hard Drives</a></strong></p>

<p>Of course, there’s also external storage for the MacBook, which is a great solution for backups or just when you need more storage than what the MacBook offers internally but don’t need to keep all the  files on the  MacBook at the same time. A Seagate 1tB external hard drive for MacBook costs just under $100 and if you’re in the market for a pocket hard drive for the MacBook then you might want to consider the <strong><a href="://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018B5CA8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0018B5CA8">Lacie all terrain rugged pocket hard drives</a></strong> that are smaller and easily fit into your MacBook case or bag and are available in both 500GB  and 1TB sizes.</p>

<p><strong>SSD Hard Drives</strong></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0039SM0B2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0039SM0B2">Crucial 256GB SSD Hard Drive</a></strong></p>

<p>Both of these hard drives are the standard platter type hard drive which work similar to a turntable might, and the data is read off of  platters that spin and the arm on the drive seeks for the data the MacBook requires at the  time.  The advantage of these drives is that the technology has pretty much been the same for years now, and the costs for hard drive space in 2011 are pretty cheap as  $100 gets you a whole whack of storage space.  **But there’s a new hard drive technology in town called SSD hard drives **which are solid state hard drives that feature no moving parts and are substantially faster than a standard hard drive could be, thanks to zero seek and read times, the data on the SSD hard drives are available much faster than standard drives resulting in no wait time and much faster startup times on the MacBooks.</p>

<p>The disadvantage of SSD hard drives for  MacBook is the price. As this technology is still relatively new, maximum sizes are limited to about <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0039SM0B2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0039SM0B2">250GB SSD Hard drives</a> and the price is much higher with street prices of about $500 common. SSD Hard drives for MacBooks are still  an upgrade to consider  thanks to the increased  performance. You could use the factory MacBook hard drive as an external hard drive with the addition of a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AAVA08/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001AAVA08">USB or Firewire external enclosure</a> but the SSD hard drives are still a bit pricey still when compared to more traditional hard drive solutions.</p>

<p><strong>MacBook Software</strong></p>

<p>The Apple MacBook ships from Apple with some very powerful software right out of the box with iMovie, iTunes and the iLife software suite included with each MacBook today. But there are times when you need to get more done with your MacBook than what’s included with the MacBook out of the box.</p>

<p>Microsoft can make some pretty questionable products and it’s my opinion that as good as Windows 7 is, the Mac OS still reigns supreme, but despite that fact, if you write a document, make a presentation, work with numbers or any other numerable tasks that require you to work and share with your Mac and PC friends in a format that is easy to open and read and free of headaches, then you do need to buy Microsoft software for your home office and school needs as it’s been that way for years, and despite the fact Apple has iWork, Office for Mac is the leader when it comes to Apple productivity software.</p>

<p>One of the best things about the Apple MacBook  is that you can work all day with Microsoft Office, and then with about $50 worth of software, the MacBook becomes the ultimate gaming machine, something Apple really hasn’t paid attention to. (Mind you, they’ve got the smartphone and MP3 player market pretty much wrapped up)</p>

<p>Anyway, this version of the popular simulation gaming franchise features a living world of Sims featuring romance, drama, and enhanced  lighting and special effects. This game is more popular than Microsoft Office so if Apple Gaming is your thing, be sure to pick up this latest Sims Game.</p>

<p>Do yourself a favor and shell out  the forty bucks or so  that Quicken costs and get your finances in shape today. This software does so much when it comes to managing your  money,  I simply cannot imagine owning a Mac without it. Too many features to list really with this personal finance money management software, but a few and most important is that Quicken can show you where to save more and spend less. This software should be a requirement  as standard equipment on every Mac, not just the MacBook.</p>

<p><strong>NoteBook Cases</strong></p>

<p>Unless for some reason you bought your MacBook with the intent of plugging it in at your desk and leaving  it there, there will come a time when you want to take your MacBook with you, and you’ll need  a case, bag, backpack  – whatever name you want to call it to carry your MacBook in something that’s both fashionable and will protect your MacBook form the bumps and grinds of daily life.</p>

<p>Notebook bags tend to be a personal decision  and I think that the decision is up to you as a lot depends on how you use your Mac notebook for everyday use as well as style and type of notebook case such as messenger bags or  backpacks for notebooks or even notebook sleeves made of neoprene might be what you’re after. But here’s a few good deals on MacBook bags, cases, whatever you want to call ’em.</p>

<p>This looks to be a pretty good case, and offers a nice look, lots of room (will hold a 17 inch MacBook Pro too) and a padded computer compartment that allows for easy removal for TSA scanning on airports. The fact that this notebook case  is on sale at over 60% off doesn’t hurt too.  One of the best notebook cases available today.</p>

<p>I doubt you guys will like this one much, as it looks a little too purse-y, but for you ladies sick of slugging around a standard looking laptop case, this tote fits up to a 15 inch notebook, which is lots of room for the MacBook and even some MacBook Pro’s. Inside, there’s not only room for the MacBook but pen and pencil loops and an internal zippered pocket too , great for  power adapters and  the like.</p>

<p>With this messenger bag from the Sharper Image, I have listed every different type of notebook bag for MacBook available and this particular mdoel should appeal to both sexes thanks to it’s over the shoulder, rest on the  hip design. Able to carry notebooks up to 15.6 inches, this notebook bag can hold MacBooks, but also windows notebooks too with ease. Lots of pockets make this an excellent choice for  a stylish notebook bag on sale.</p>

<p>The Cheapest RAM for Apple iMacs can be found here for [4GB DDR3 1333MHz sodimms][1], which is the type of RAM you will need for the 2010 Apple iMacs. The Apple iMacs released in the summer of 2010 can accept up to [16GB of RAM][2] and by filling the four available memory upgrade slots with 4x4GB DDR sodimms for Apple iMac you will enjoy faster iMac, and an Apple desktop computer that will be able to open more applications at the same time too – allowing you to get more done faster</p>

<p><span style="text-align: left;">There’s rumor of a 2011 iMac in April, and it wouldn’t surprise me, as the iMac is Apple’s consumer based desktop computer and the release of the new Apple iMacs would be in time for both the back to school shopping season as well as the Christmas shopping season for for 2011.</span></p>

  <p style="text-align: left;">
    <strong>Where to find the Cheapest 2010 iMac RAM<br /> </strong><br /> I&#8217;ve already mentioned the type of RAM you need to buy to fill your Apple iMac with memory, and the next question is where to buy RAM for iMac for less? I&#8217;m a fan of, <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">Crucial</a>, <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/OWC">OWC</a> and <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/1800">1-800-4-Memory </a>to name a few of the best memory stores, with OWC being the only online store dedicated entirely to apple upgrades, they might be your best bet if you need advice on what specific RAM you need to buy for the latest iMacs, but the other memory stores should be able to help you out too as they not only carry memory for Apple, but also other PC manufacturers such as Dell, Sony, HP etc.
  </p>
  
  <p style="text-align: left;">
    One other factor to determine when shopping for the cheapest iMac memory you can buy is support, after or before you buy. Of the few memory stores I listed above, just one actually offers name brand and in most cases is not the cheapest RAM as the Crucial memory is name brand RAM made by Micron, whereas for the most part, all the other stores offer two types of RAM for iMacs, both name brand and generic but the generic stuff is what gets quoted when shopping for Apple iMac RAM and the lowest price is the most important buying decision.
  </p>
  
  <p style="text-align: left;">
    Whatever way you choose to go, whether that means buying RAM from Amazon or Best Buy, or you select the few memory stores I recommend you will do much, much, better on price for 2010 iMac memory if you stay away from the Apple Store. Apple&#8217;s stores are great when you physcially need to see or touch the Apple product before you buy it, but for memory products this is really not needed, and there&#8217;s a very good chance Apple will supply you with Micron or Samsung memory upgrades anyway, so you&#8217;re better to shop online for iMac RAM for considerable savings.

<p>What is the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com">best iMac RAM</a> and where can buy RAM for iMacs the cheapest? This is one question I answer multiple times daily.</p>

<p>In this case, we’re looking to upgrade the memory on the <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00361EZX8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00361EZX8">Apple iMac 27 inch 3.2Ghz</a></strong>, which is a summer <strong>2010 Apple iMac</strong>, and at the time one of the biggest and fastest Apple iMacs you can buy today, so it makes absolutely perfect sense to upgrade the RAM on this Apple iMac model to maximize the performance of this iMac which is still a current model in 2011.<br />
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00361EZX8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00361EZX8"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1107" title="Cheapest Apple iMac" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-22-at-4.10.30-PM1.png" alt="Best Price Apple iMac" width="288" height="286" /></a></p>

<p>The <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00361EZX8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00361EZX8">iMac 27 inch 3.2Ghz</a></strong> features an Intel i3 dual core processor (with a nickname of clarkdale) and out of the box from Apple ships with just 4GB of RAM installed, so there’s plenty of room for RAM upgrades with this big screen high speed iMac. All 2010 Apple iMac models, including this one can accept 16GB of RAM, allowing you to effectively quadruple the memory upgrades on the iMac models released earlier last year in 2010.</p>

<p>As you can see from the <strong>Apple iMac RAM Prices</strong> above, RAM upgrades for the Apple iMac are pretty cheap and you can upgrade the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00361EZX8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00361EZX8">3.2Ghz Apple iMac</a> to the maximum RAM allowed of 16GB for under $100 now. RAM for iMacs wasn’t always this cheap and just a few short years ago 8GB of RAM for iMacs would have set you back more than the Apple iMac itself with a $1000 price tag for 8GB of iMac RAM.</p>

<p>But the good news is technology marches on and prices get cheaper, and now that 16GB RAM for iMacs have been around for a while it makes no sense to me why you wouldn’t want to upgrade any iMac RAM to the maximum allowed.</p>

<p>**How To Upgrade <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00361EZX8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00361EZX8">iMac 27 inch 3.2Ghz</a><br />
**<br />
Once you have bought the RAM for iMac 27 inch 3.2GHz, it’s really easy to install the ram yourself, and <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1423#1">Apple even provides instructions on how to do so </a> which as you can see is pretty easy. Place the iMac face down, raise the stand, remove the door covering the memory slots and you will have easy access to the four iMac memory upgrade slots for memory upgrade installation.</p>

<p>This particular Apple iMac model (this applies to all 2010 iMacs) require <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/iMac_(DDR3_1333)/">DDR3 1333Mhz SDRAM sodimms</a>. To get to the maximum of 16GB of RAM for Apple iMacs you will have to remove the factory installed iMac RAM (which you can trade in at time of purchase. <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/OWC">OWC</a> is just one vendor who will buy back your Apple RAM, saving you even more money on your total iMac upgrade) and replace it with 4x 4GB DDR3 SDRAM sodimms. Some memory stores also sell iMac memory in upgrade kits – more for marketing than anything else, but you should check both <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/iMac_KITS_(DDR3_1333)-16gb/">16GB DDR3 RAM kits</a> and <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/iMac_(DDR3_1333)-4gb/">4GB DDR3 RAM modules for Apple iMacs</a> if you want to get the very best deal on Apple desktop computer memory.</p>

<p>**Best RAM for IMac 3.2GHz 27 inch<br />
**</p>

<p>I’m always reluctant to recommend any one vendor because there’s so many different variables when it comes to choosing the best RAM for you and your iMac. If you’re interested in price only, then the table above shows you the <strong>lowest iMac RAM prices available right now</strong>, but don’t forget about other variables too, such as free shipping on RAM, shipping times, trade in allowances if applicable and the speed you need the RAM delivered. Then we get to the generic RAM vs name brand RAM. Most memory stores offer you a choice when shopping for RAM: You can buy the cheapest RAM, which is usually generic memory or name brand RAM from Samsung or Kingston or Crucial RAM. With the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">crucial</a> RAM, you get a name brand, but you’ll pay more for it and the price premium may or may not be worth the price when it comes to choosing the best RAM – iMac or otherwise. I can tell you that if you buy RAM from any of the memory stores I list here you’ll be buying memory from a reputable memory seller who happily will support the same both pre-sale and post sale in the rare event you have any problems with your iMac RAM.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2011/03/how-much-memory-will-a-macbook-pro-recognize/">How Much Memory Will A MacBook Pro Recognize?</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>Memory upgrades for the Apple MacBook Pro now ship in three different ram types for the MacBook Pro and depending on the specific Apple Mac Pro you have and are wanting to or needing to add ram upgrades to  – the answer will be different. The short answer  to your question **How Much Memory Will a MacBook Pro Recognize? **is that it depends on what Apple MacBook Pro you are needing to max out with Apple memory.</p>

<p><strong>PC2 5300 DDR2 MacBook Pro RAM Upgrades</strong></p>

<p>MacBook Pro RAM over the years has shipped in various speeds and memory sizes with the first MacBook Pros only being able to recognize 2GB of RAM. I’m not going to list all the different MacBook Pro models that maxed out at 2GB, but let’s say if your MacBook Pro is 3 years old or  older there’s a good chance that the MacBook Pro 2GB maximum Applied.</p>

<p><strong>PC3 1066 DDR3 MacBook Pro RAM Upgrades</strong></p>

<p>Then in oh, about  2008 the MacBook Pros made out of aluminum showed up on the scene and with the faster processors, these MBP’s also required different RAM than the older MacBook Pro models did as DDR3 1066 SDRAM sodimms became the standard memory upgrades for the MacBook Pro  and with them came the ability to accept 4GB of RAM –  a big bump as now the MacBook Pros could accept 4GB of RAM in the form of 2x2gB memory upgrade modules.  In 2009, the MacBook Pros could accept 8GB of RAM which was really a a big deal, but so was the price – when you could first install 8GB into a MacBook Pro, the cost was almost one thousand dollars, which was the same as or close to the cost of the MacBook  Pro. Thankfully  ram prices for MacBook Pros  have dropped considerably and for most MBP’s that will accept 8GB of RAM you can now max out your MacBook Pro for under $100 from most memory vendors.</p>

<p><strong>PC3 1333 DDR3 MacBook Pro RAM Upgrades</strong></p>

<p>In 2011, – last month to be exact – Apple has released the latest and best MacBook Pros to date with faster processors, longer battery life and… <strong>the same 8GB of RAM</strong> as the previous models. This is a disappointment  as the rumor sites were sure we’d  see the latest MacBook Pros to support 16GB of RAM. But last week, OWC announced that they have tested and  approved for sale 16GB RAM for MacBook Pro models  in 2011. But these are the <strong>most expensive ram upgrades for MacBook Pro</strong> I have ever seen and at the time I write this will cost you more than the MacBook Pro you will want to ugprade.</p>

<p>[table id=15 /]</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="buying macbook RAM">Buying MacBook Pro RAM</a></strong></p>

<p>Once you have determined what MacBook Pro you have, which can be tricky –  but one way is to just go to the apple menu  and  select about this Mac, which at very least will show you what kind or speed of RAM you need which helps you narrow down the above 3 choices for MacBook Pro RAM  from 3 different ram types to three.  An example would be in my case, I’m typing this on a 2008 Apple MacBook Pro which shows I have the maximum  4GB of MacBook RAM installed:</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  As you can see, my particular Apple MacBook Model uses 1066MHz RAM. The system runs the DDR3 1066MHz RAM at 1066.6 MHz, and thus the memory speed is reported as 1067MHz, instead of 1066MHz, but make no mistake you need to buy DDR3 SDRAM RAM upgrades if your MacBook reads the memory speed as 1067MHz.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Once you&#8217;ve nailed down what RAM upgrades you need to buy for the MacBook Pro, the next step is for you to choose whether you want to buy the cheapest MacBook  RAM you can find, or if you choose to buy name brand RAM such as Crucial Memory, which offer both a name brand product but also support as well that&#8217;s top notch too.  On a related note,  I got asked the other day if <a href="http://www.macmemorystore.com" rel="nofollow">Mac Memory Store</a> is any good?
</p>

<p>and my answer is, I don’t know. I have never bought RAM or dealt with them in any way. One way to check if a memory vendor is any good is to <a href="http://www.resellerratings.com">check the ratings they receive online</a>, but this isn’t always a good way to buy RAM either as people tend to complain far more than compliment so the results are weighted and usually for the worst. I can only recommend the best RAM Brands I can trust, and over the years have bought memory from myself, and I suggest you do the same if you’re looking to maximize your MacBook RAM but minimize the grief and trouble from dealing with unknown memory stores.</p>

<p>**2010 Apple Mac Mini Memory<br />
**[table id=5 /]</p>

<p>Mac Mini memory for the 2011 (well, OK..the 2010 Mac Mini as that’s the last time we’ve seen an Apple Mac Mini refresh) is sold either in <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/Mac_Mini_(1066_DDR3)/">individual memory modules</a> or as Apple <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/Mac_Mini_KITS_(1066_DDR3)/">Mac Mini memory upgrade kits</a> and with those two pages you should be able to, without much trouble find the best deal on Mac Mini RAM for your new Mac Mini.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013FK9U2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0013FK9U2"><img class="size-full wp-image-1052 alignnone" title="Cheapest Mac Mini" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-14-at-10.51.55-AM.png" alt="Best Deal Mac Mini" width="283" height="168" /></a></p>

<p>**<br />
**</p>

<p>Regardless whether you plan to use the Mac Mini as just the <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26x%3D0%26ref_%3Dnb_sb_noss%26y%3D0%26field-keywords%3Dmac%2520mini%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">cheapest Apple computer you can buy</a></strong> today or if you plan on using the Apple Mac Mini as a fileserver for videos, photos or movies the Mac Mini will run faster, smoother and perform better overall with more RAM.</p>

<p>Thanks to the latest Mac Mini redesign which allows you to upgrade the Mac Mini RAM yourself without the added expense and hassle of having to have an Apple authorized dealer perform the ram upgrade for you, even if you are on the strictest budget you should upgrade the RAM to the maximum ram possible for one reason:</p>

<p><strong>Mac Mini RAM is Cheap!</strong></p>

<p><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">But, hey don’t just take my word for it – check out the lowest prices on Mac Mini memory upgrades: </span></strong></p>

<p>I won’t talk about individual Mac Mini prices but as you can see from the chart above, it’s not to hard to max out your Mac Mini for less than $100 from a selection of high quality RAM stores, as that’s the only memory store I will work with – the guys you can trust to ship and sell you the best Mac Mini RAM at the best price they can and back it up with a warranty. There’s a list of the best memory stores in the top right corner where you can <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/">buy Mac RAM cheap</a>.</p>

<p>When you’ve decided that you do need to ugprade the RAM on your Mac Mini, and you’ve bought it online and are ready to replace your old Mac Mini RAM the next step is to figure out how to do this Mac Mini memory upgrade yourself because for the first time since the Apple Mac Mini was introduced – <strong>you can upgrade the Mac Mini RAM yourself</strong></p>

<p>In fact, the Mac Mini RAM Upgrade has to be one of the easiest Apple computers to upgrade and Apple even supplies you with instructions on <a href="http://manuals.info.apple.com/en_US/Mac_mini_Mid2010_User_Guide.pdf">how to boost the Mac Mini 2010 Memory</a></p>

<p>You can install up to 8GB of RAM in the 2010 Mac Mini in the two memory upgrade slots that are available, meaning you will have to buy 4GB RAM modules that are DDR3 SDRAM running at 1066MHz in a a 240 pin sodimm configuration. This is the exact same memory that’s used in the Apple iMacs, MacBook and MacBook Pros from 2010 as well. (The newest iMacs released last summer use DDR3 RAM which won’t work)</p>

<p>There are loads of <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">memory stores</a> that will sell you <strong>RAM cheap for the Mac Mini</strong> but 8GB upgrade kits for the Mac Mini should be priced under $100 from most memory upgrade vendors online today.</p>

<p>Now that Apple does not require you to open the Mac Min by voiding your warranty, the new 2010 Mac Mini is way easier to upgrade the memory on and I suggest you Max out the RAM on your Mac Mini for the <a>fastest Mac Mini you can buy</a> in 2011.</p>
