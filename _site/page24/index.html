   <B> <h1><a href="/2012/08/where-to-buy-memory-cards-for-digital-cameras/">Where To Buy Memory Cards for Digital Cameras</a></h1></B>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content">**Memory cards for digital cameras**. If you don&#8217;t have one(or more) you are dead in the water and your [fancy digital camera might][1] as well be a door stop, or conversation piece for your coffee table. A digital camera memory card is to a digital camera or DSLR, what a roll of film or kodachrome (RIP) was to film cameras back in the day.

## **What Kind of Memory Cards for Digital Cameras Do I Need? **

For most of us memory cards for cameras in 2012 come in two different forms: compact flash and SDHC memory cards. The former tend to be used with higher end DSLR&#8217;s (My Nikon D300 takes compact flash) while the latter is mostly used in compact or more consumer based DSLR&#8217;s. One of the benefits of the SDHC cards over the compact flash is that they tend to be more compatible with other devices too and there&#8217;s a good chance your notebook Mac or PC will include a SDHC memory card reader built into the notebook, avoiding the need to use or carry an external memory card reader.

There are a few memory card types from Sony that tend to be less mainstream &#8211; their memorystick technology never really took the world by storm and it&#8217;s too soon to see if the Sony XQD technology will become mainstream. Right now, this is a very expensive memory card.

## What About Memory Card Speed?

Like a lot of things in the technology world &#8211; the faster the better, and this applies to memory cards too as the faster the card the faster your camera can write the file to the card and is ready to take the next shot. The last thing you want to do is be left waiting while your memory card writes your file(s) to your memory card. Common speeds are 45Mb/s for SDHC memory cards and 30 to 90 MB/s for compact flash memory cards.

## What Size of Memory Card Should I Buy For My Digital Camera?

I like to buy the biggest memory card I can buy for the best price I can find online. This may require some time and patience but you can get some really good deals on camera memory if you shop around. I tend to shoot JPEG vs RAW so my space requirements are much less than a RAW shooter with a high megapixel digital camera. I have an 8GB card in my Nikon D300 that&#8217;s been just fine for years, and I have never run out of room.

## **Where To Buy Memory Cards for Digital Cameras **

I like [**Amazon for lots of memory cards**][2] due to the fact that I have an Amazon Prime membership, so shipping is fast and free, but you should also check [**Adorama**][3] and[** B+H**][4] for Digital Camera memory cards too as they often feature deals on memory cards as well from time to time too.

   <B> <h1><a href="/2012/08/when-will-the-2012-mac-mini-release-date-be/">When Will The 2012 Mac Mini Release Date Be?</a></h1></B>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content">I am writing this on a** 2011 Apple Mac Mini**. It&#8217;s the higher end model, and my wife works with the l**ower end model too**. We&#8217;re a Mac Mini family. But both of these apple Mac Minis were released in 2011, not this year &#8211; and that means they are a year old now, [out of warranty][1] and slowly becoming obsolete. We would love to buy new Apple Mac Mini&#8217;s but there&#8217;s one problem. Apple has not released them yet. The only brand new Apple computer we have seen is the **MacBook Pro Retina** display, and even that model is a few months old now

## **When I think the Mac Mini Release Date Will Be**

The Apple Mac Mini is one of the more popular computers due to the fact that they are the cheapest Apple Mac you can buy. They are not the Apple computer under $500, but they are close. If you shop around you can buy a Mac Mini for a small discount  &#8211; about $35.00 on **Amazon**, **MacMall** or** Best Buy** for even less than the Apple Store charges. And speaking of the Apple Store, one way to get a cheap Mac Mini is to check the [**refurbished Apple Mac Mini section**][2] on the Apple Store online. It&#8217;s hit and miss with stock, but if you&#8217;re willing to wait this is the only way to buy a Mac under $500.00.

Another reason for the popularity of the Mac MIni is the fact that these make excellent home theater or audio servers. You don&#8217;t need fancy software of any kind. All you need is the free iTunes and some sort of wireless connector for your TV or stereo &#8211; usually in the form of an **airport express** or **Apple TV**. You don&#8217;t need a monitor once you&#8217;ve got the Mac Mini set up for serving your movie and music files and you can control the Mac Mini via your Apple iPhone thanks to the free Apple remote software.

All this said, there&#8217;s more than one computer from Apple we&#8217;re waiting for we haven&#8217;t seen a release date for the iMac either yet, or the Mac Pro yet too. All the rumors for the Mac Pro seem to state 2013 for it, but we could see a brand new [Apple iMac release as early as September 2012.][3] We&#8217;re already into the end of August, so that doesn &#8216;t leave much time and Apple usually refreshes the iPod line in the fall too to grab a good share of the holiday shopping season. We might even see an iPad 4 by the end of the year too.

So when to squeeze a Mac Mini release into all that? The Mac Mini would be a better choice than a new iMac release due to the cost and use as a media servier so I think that this will come first. When, I have no idea but my guess would be either late fall or early in January 2013 we should see a faster processor (probably the same as the MacBook Pro&#8217;s) and probably a ram increase too to [8GB of RAM][4] with a maximum of 16GB for the Mac Mini instead of the current 8GB maximum Apple recommends.

Of course, I could be wrong with all of this and Apple could wait until later in 2013 and continue to sell the best selling computer in their lineup, the MacBook Pro and MacBook Air, as these are 2012 Apple computers already. Like a lot of things in life, only time will tell **when the final release date for the Apple Mac Mini** will be.

   <B> <h1><a href="/2012/08/what-is-the-least-expensive-nikon-full-frame-camera/">What is the Least Expensive Nikon Full Frame Camera?</a></h1></B>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content">If you&#8217;re shooting any type of full frame lenses, your best bet is to shoot with a full frame camera vs a DX camera &#8211; especially if you&#8217;re shooting wide angle lenses and want to take advantage of their perspective and large viewing angle. On full frame cameras, the wide angles can really sing in getting you great photos whether you are shooting landscapes or group photos or perhaps you just want to get a different view on the world &#8211; shooting wide angle lenses allows you to do it.

If you&#8217;re shooting longer lenses, or even normal lenses on DX cameras like the Nikon D7000 for example, understand that any Nikon lens you mount on a Nikon DX camer will multiply the focal length by 1.5x. Your 35mm 1.8 becomes a 52mm 1.8 &#8211; In a way this is great because you now have a[ very fast normal lens for under $200][1], and if you shoot longer telephotos &#8211; they really help you extend your reach &#8211; great for shooting sports or birds when you can&#8217;t get close to the action.

[<img class="size-full wp-image-6174 alignleft" title="Best full frame nikon camera" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Screen-Shot-2012-08-23-at-9.31.50-AM.png" alt="cheapest full frame Nikon camera" width="291" height="298" />][2]

**The Advantages of Full Frame Cameras**

The advantage of full frame cameras usually come in the terms of image quality. Because a full frame or FX camera&#8217;s sensor is bigger the images tend to be more natural because you&#8217;re not cramming as much pixels into such a small space. For me, the advantages of full frame are the wide angle lens use, but there&#8217;s ways around it by buying DX wide angle lenses but even at 18mm wide you may not find that wide enough. I would much prefer to shoot with my Nikon 20mm f/2.8 at 20mm than an 18-55 DX lens where the math works out to a 28mm focal length.

**The Cheapest Nikon Full Frame Camera**

For Nikon shooters, we currently have two options if you want to shoot in full frame, and that comes in the form of the Nikon D800 or Nikon D700.

The Nikon D700 is the cheaper of the two with a street price of about $2200. This is a four year old camera though and offers the technology that was the best at the time with 12 megapixels of resolution, outstanding low light performance and 51 point autofocus system. Check [**Adorama**][3], [**Amazon**][4] and [**B+H**][5] for the best prices on the Nikon D700

The Nikon D800 is the much newer full frame camera from Nikon and offers much higher resolution &#8211; almost 3x as much at 36MP, faster processors, and much newer technology than the much older Nikon D700. You&#8217;ll pay a premium for this though with a street price for the Nikon D800 of about $3000.00 online. Check [**Amazon**][2], [**B+H** ][6]and [**Adorama**][7] for prices.

At the current time, the cheapest Nikon full frame camera is the Nikon D700. Is it worth it to skip the Nikon D700 and go to the Nikon D800? One question you have to ask yourself is do you shoot video, or are you planning to? The Nikon D700 does not offer HD video shooting while the Nikon D800 does. In my mind, this is the major difference between the Nikon D700 and Nikon D800 and depending on your answer the price you pay for the Nikon D800 &#8211; even though you may end up paying more for it than the Nikon D700 might be worth it.

   <B> <h1><a href="/2012/08/what-is-the-best-sony-5-1-receiver-price/">What is the Best Sony 5.1 Receiver Price?</a></h1></B>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content">Sony receivers for both home theater use and even stereo listening can be great bargains, if you shop around and analyze your needs on what you plan on using the 5.1 receiver for. All come with a plethora of features that include several audio and video inputs, HDMI in and out, and a stereo tuner for AM and FM listening. Of course, being a 5.1 receiver from Sony, that means there are also front speakers, a center speaker and surround speaker connectors to. You&#8217;ll need to buy your speakers for your sony receiver separately, and there&#8217;s too many options to list here today. But, let&#8217;s look at a few Sony 5.1 Receivers and their prices. One of these should be the best Sony receiver for you.

# 

# Sony STRDH520 7.1 Channel 3D AV Receiver

[<img class="size-full wp-image-6169 alignleft" title="best sony receiver" alt="cheapest sony receiver" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Screen-Shot-2012-08-23-at-8.05.56-AM.png" width="461" height="356" />][1]

This Sony is a 7.1 vs 5.1 receiver, but don&#8217;t worry about that as all this means is there are an extra set of surround speaker connectors on the back of the receiver, and you don&#8217;t need to use them if you don&#8217;t need or want to. This is one of the best selling home theater receivers under $300 and definitely worth consideration thanks to it&#8217;s impressive feature set:

  * 100 watts per channel for all seven channels.
  * 6 HD connections. Four are HDMI and 2 component video
  * 3D Pass Thru
  * HD Digital Cinema Sound
  * Dolby TrueHD, Pro logic IIz and dts HD enhanced audio codecs

This is a full featured receiver for both audio and HT from Sony, and the best part is all this[** only costs a little over $200. **][2]

But what if you need more features and want to spend a little more money for a Sony receiver to get those features? The Sony mentioned above might be the best budget receiver from Sony, but it may not be the best overall deal. Sometimes, it&#8217;s best to spend a bit more money on a Sony receiver.

# Sony STRDH830 Sony 3D 7.1 Channel A/V Receiver

This Sony [**will cost you a bit more money**][1], double in fact compared to the cheaper STRDH5220 above, but you get one important feature that I think every receiver for 2012 should have, and that&#8217;s iPod connectivity. The Apple iPod has become the defacto standard when it comes to portable music, but when you&#8217;re at home or office you want to listen to something with a little more oooph, and the Sony receiver above offers that in spades and will sound much better than the Apple earbuds that came with your Apple iPod.

The best part? This Sony receiver even includes an Apple iPod dock, unlike some other brands that force you to buy an iPod dock for your stereo or home theater receiver separately. This is the perfect marriage between the two biggest electronics companies in the world today.

Besides the fact that you can use the iPod with this receiver, the Sony STRDH830 also offers more power (140 watts, instead of 100 watts), another HDMI input (5 vs 4), the ability to upscale analog video to 1080i, an advanced on-screen digital display, Digital audio calibration for perfect sound from all your speakers, and Bravia sync so you only need one remote control when used in conjunction with your Sony Bravia HDTV.

Overall, I think that this is the much better value receiver from the two. Yes, you pay more up front, but the higher end Sony includes an iPod dock, and connectivity options, and I know for me, that&#8217;s worth much much more than the minimal increase in cost.

<br>

		<div class="post-content">Boy, if there&#8217;s one theme for 2012 when it comes to releases of new Apple computers, one word comes to mind and that&#8217;s stingy. In recent years we would have had at very least two different models released this year from Apple &#8211; more if you consider items like the Apple iPad too. 

This time last year, we saw new MacBook Pros in Feb 2011, new Apple iMacs in May 2011 and new Apple Mac Minis in July 2011. Yet here it is at August 2012 and the only new model from Apple is the new MacBook Pro&#8217;s (and Air&#8217;s too) but for the most part &#8211; with the exception of the Apple MacBook Pro Retina Display &#8211; all the others considered new are really just the same old notebooks from Apple with faster graphics cards and processors and USB 3.0 ports. 

The l[ast release date for the iMac][1] was in May 2011, so we&#8217;re long overdue for a new consumer desktop of some sort &#8211; even if it&#8217;s not an iMac, there&#8217;s a lot of us who are chained to their desk much more than some other road warriors, and we don&#8217;t need to pay the portable tax of more money for a smaller screen and battery power we don&#8217;t use when we would much rather appreciate a large display and more comfortable ergonomics a desktop system provides. 

That&#8217;s a long time between iMac releases and I&#8217;m surprised that Apple hasn&#8217;t offered up a new iMac for the summer 2012 back to school crowd, or maybe they&#8217;re trying to get this market into their portable notebooks like the MacBook Air or MacBook Pro which probably offer a bigger profit margin. 

I&#8217;m going to guess we will not see an iMac release in August as everybody is on holiday and it&#8217;s way too late to catch the back to school market now. This leaves us with September or October. By then, 90+ days will have passed on the MacBook Pro release date and history shows us that Apple tends to save the fall for the iPods as these are the hottest holiday electronics gift for the holidays year after year. 

We may have to wait until January 2013 to see an new Apple iMac, and my guess is it will be something revolutionary &#8211; like the release of the MacBook Pro Retina Display was for the aging MacBook Pro line. The iMac has essentially been unchanged for years now and for most of us you would be hard pressed to tell one year from another at first glance when comparing iMac models, so it would be very refreshing to see not only a new and improved iMac but also a completely new design too. 

My totally uneducated guess is Apple will wait until the new year the iMac release date. They alreada have a bunch of really great products to get them through the remainder of 2012 and I think they should concentrate their efforts on future products that offer more for Apple and their bottom line. 

As far as computing technology goes an Apple Desktop of any kind is far from cutting edge in 2012 as more and more of us migrate to using portables, tablets and even smartphones.

One of the best things about technology is that sooner or later everything becomes affordable and one area where this is especially true is when it comes to hard drive technology. What once was unreachable for the average consumer is now available on sale for under $50.00 depending on the size of the hard drive you are shopping for.

First, we have to determine whether you need an internal 2.5 inch hard drive or an external 2.5 inch hard drive because in most cases they have different uses. Internal 2.5 inch hard drives usually are available as SATA hard drives and are designed to fit in notebook computers, netbooks or some small desktop computers like nettop desktop computers. You may even find a 2.5 inch hard drive in older Apple TV models too.

External 2.5 inch hard drives, are, as the name implies designed to be connected to your computer externally. In most instances, the only difference between an internal hard drive and an external hard drive is that the small portable external hard drives tend to be powered by an USB port and are compatible with Macs or PCs via the USB 2.0 and USB 3.0 port. External 2.5 inch hard drives are the perfect solution for small and portable storage when need to move files from computer to computer or just need extra room for your music, files, photos or movies to be stored. External 2.5 inch hard drives are also a perfect solution as a backup drive too.

**Where to Buy Under $50.00 2.5 inch Hard Drives. **

One of the first places I check for hard drives of any size is at **<a>Amazon</a>**, as the prices tend to be the lowest and **[there&#8217;s always a hard drive on sale][1].** Another place to check for hard drive deals is [**Crucial**][2], as they too &#8211; after years of selling memory upgrades have ventured into the hard drive arena as well. I find that Amazon is my go-to for anything and not just hard drives and I have found it&#8217;s really hard to beat their price when it comes to finding the best 2.5 inch hard drive for the best price.

   <B> <h1><a href="/2012/08/is-8gb-of-ram-enough-for-photo-editing/">Is 8GB of RAM Enough For Photo Editing?</a></h1></B>
		

<br>

I think so.

Most notebooks today and desktops too, ship with about 4GB of RAM and so I recommend you double the memory on your Mac or PC to 8GB &#8211; especially for photo editing as some of the more advanced processing like sharpening or unsharp mask in Photoshop take a lot of processing and memory power.

Most photo editing software will run fine on less ram, but with 8GB of RAM being so cheap I think if you do any photo editing, even if you&#8217;re just using Apple iPhoto, you would be wise to install the additional memory upgrade.

Minimum memory requirements for the photo editing software just means that the software will open on your Mac or PC and all functions should run. But, they don&#8217;t say how fast the work will get done, and if you really want to increase the photo editing or post processing process in your photography workflow, an 8GB ram upgrade is a no brainer if you ask me.

Some Macs, like the new MacBook Pros and the iMacs will even accept 16GB of RAM which of course doubles the ram from 8GB to 16Gb and speeds up the process when it comes to photo editing even more.

Adding more ram allows your Mac or PC to get more work done faster and avoid the spinning pinwheel as you wait for your computer to catch up with your current photo editing task or function and with ram prices being so cheap, you can fill your Mac or PC with memory for much less than you may think.  At the time I write this, 8GB is priced about $50, and 16GB runs you double the price at about $100. If you have a new MacBook Pro released this summer &#8211; expect to pay a bit more &#8211;  especially if you want to max out the MacBook Pro&#8217;s ram to the full 16GB &#8211; current street prices cost about $175.00 for 16GB of RAM

**In a way, both Crucial and Apple are correct.**

Let me explain:

You see, the Apple iMac last saw a refresh over a year ago, in May 2011and at the time 16gB was the maximum memory supported for the Apple iMac due to the fact that only 4GB memory modules in a 1333Mhz configuration were available and even a year ago it would cost you over $100 for 8GB of RAM for the iMac and a whopping $400 if you bought the RAM from Apple directly.

So, when Apple released the iMac they stated that 16GB was the maximum ram you can buy by upgrading all four available memory slots with 4GB DDR 3 SDRAM sodimms: 4x4GB = 16GB

Fast forward to today where you can buy 8GB memory modules for iMac that were not available at the time of the iMac&#8217;s release date, so in this case Crucial is correct because if you were to buy 4x8GB DDR3 sodimms for the iMac from Crucial you&#8217;d have 32GB installed.

Is It Safe To Install 32GB of RAM into an Apple iMac

Here&#8217;s the tricky part. It&#8217;s more than likely OK that you&#8217;ll be fine installing 32GB of RAM in your iMac and seeing that the recommendation comes from Crucial and not some questionable seller on eBay I&#8217;m going to stick my neck out and say you&#8217;ll probably be fine with the 32GB in your iMac. After all, Crucial&#8217;s big slogan is that crucial memory is guaranteed to work with your computer.

All this said, because Apple states the maximum of 16GB, that&#8217;s where I would stop. Why? Because there&#8217;s a good chance your warranty is toast if you install more than the amount of RAM recommended by Apple at the time of release.

I know that personally, with my Mac Mini bought in March, I stopped at 8Gb even though I could technically install 16GB in my Mac Mini I choose not to because I didn&#8217;t want to void my one year of Applecare and adding more ram than what Apple suggests could do that. Perhaps when I replace the Mac Mini or the Applecare Warranty lapses I may attempt an upgrade of more RAM.

It all comes down to how comfortable you are with voiding your warranty in the rare case that something may go wrong with 32GB of RAM in a 2011 iMac.

I can&#8217;t recommend you go higher than 16GB of RAM, regardless of memory upgrade advice from Crucial.</div>

      No.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      If the RAM on your Mac is bad, or has gone bad <strong>it&#8217;s toast.</strong>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Your only option is to replace the RAM with new RAM and if you&#8217;re going to go to the trouble of buying new RAM to replace the dead RAM, I suggest you double (or even triple the RAM too) at the same time for on reason only. RAM is so cheap.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Just like current interest rates the prices have never been so low for so much memory in the over 15 years I have been monitoring RAM prices. It&#8217;s just a few years ago, you would have to pay over $1000 for a 16GB ram upgrade for the iMac and now that same upgrade will cost you nothing at all in comparison &#8211; usually under $100 and even less if you sell your old RAM. (this option may not be available to you if your current RAM upgrade has gone bad)
    </p>
    
    <p>
      But, before you go and replace ram be sure that it&#8217;s gone bad. I know <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/diagnosing-memory-problems-on-your-computer&ei=zBQhUKXIMKK36QHgt4HIBQ&sa=X&oi=unauthorizedredirect&ct=targetlink&ust=1344347092798233&usg=AFQjCNG5ydFAjs1OvQvZX3BSNGyZZVKosg">Microsoft windows offers a memory test option</a>, and you can test the RAM on your Mac too using <a href="http://cdn.command-tab.com/2008/memtest_422.zip">memtest</a>.(direct download link).
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Another option to consider: Is the ram upgrade in your Mac or PC seated properly. I know from personal experience, this has happened to me where I thought I had installed memory on my Mac Mini only to find that I hadn&#8217;t and that the Mac would crash every time I woke from sleep. So I flipped the Mac Mini over, unscrewed the handy plastic cover (if only all Macs allowed such an easy upgrade) and removed and re-installed my memory upgrade ensuring that it was fully installed &#8211; sometimes you have to press hard on the memory module to have the ram seat in the memory upgrade slot correctly.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Once I had re-installed the RAM on my Mac Mini &#8211; all my crashing and startup errors were gone. It wasn&#8217;t the RAM that was bad afterall, it was the crummy installation job by yours truly.  It costs you nothing to try and reinstall your ram in your computer or complete a full memory test so I suggest you check these two items before you spend your hard earned money on RAM you may not need to buy.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      If it turns out your memory really has gone south, the only option is to replace the RAM, but RAM is so cheap it&#8217;s worthwhile upgrading the RAM over replacing your PC. 8Gb of RAM currently is priced about $50 for most computer models and if your Mac or PC can handle it &#8211; I suggest going all the way to 16GB of RAM with street prices running you only about $100 for 16Gb of RAM today.
