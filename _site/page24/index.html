   <B> <h1><a href="/2012/08/what-is-the-least-expensive-nikon-full-frame-camera/">What is the Least Expensive Nikon Full Frame Camera?</a></h1></B>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content">If you&#8217;re shooting any type of full frame lenses, your best bet is to shoot with a full frame camera vs a DX camera &#8211; especially if you&#8217;re shooting wide angle lenses and want to take advantage of their perspective and large viewing angle. On full frame cameras, the wide angles can really sing in getting you great photos whether you are shooting landscapes or group photos or perhaps you just want to get a different view on the world &#8211; shooting wide angle lenses allows you to do it.

If you&#8217;re shooting longer lenses, or even normal lenses on DX cameras like the Nikon D7000 for example, understand that any Nikon lens you mount on a Nikon DX camer will multiply the focal length by 1.5x. Your 35mm 1.8 becomes a 52mm 1.8 &#8211; In a way this is great because you now have a[ very fast normal lens for under $200][1], and if you shoot longer telephotos &#8211; they really help you extend your reach &#8211; great for shooting sports or birds when you can&#8217;t get close to the action.

[<img class="size-full wp-image-6174 alignleft" title="Best full frame nikon camera" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Screen-Shot-2012-08-23-at-9.31.50-AM.png" alt="cheapest full frame Nikon camera" width="291" height="298" />][2]

**The Advantages of Full Frame Cameras**

The advantage of full frame cameras usually come in the terms of image quality. Because a full frame or FX camera&#8217;s sensor is bigger the images tend to be more natural because you&#8217;re not cramming as much pixels into such a small space. For me, the advantages of full frame are the wide angle lens use, but there&#8217;s ways around it by buying DX wide angle lenses but even at 18mm wide you may not find that wide enough. I would much prefer to shoot with my Nikon 20mm f/2.8 at 20mm than an 18-55 DX lens where the math works out to a 28mm focal length.

**The Cheapest Nikon Full Frame Camera**

For Nikon shooters, we currently have two options if you want to shoot in full frame, and that comes in the form of the Nikon D800 or Nikon D700.

The Nikon D700 is the cheaper of the two with a street price of about $2200. This is a four year old camera though and offers the technology that was the best at the time with 12 megapixels of resolution, outstanding low light performance and 51 point autofocus system. Check [**Adorama**][3], [**Amazon**][4] and [**B+H**][5] for the best prices on the Nikon D700

The Nikon D800 is the much newer full frame camera from Nikon and offers much higher resolution &#8211; almost 3x as much at 36MP, faster processors, and much newer technology than the much older Nikon D700. You&#8217;ll pay a premium for this though with a street price for the Nikon D800 of about $3000.00 online. Check [**Amazon**][2], [**B+H** ][6]and [**Adorama**][7] for prices.

At the current time, the cheapest Nikon full frame camera is the Nikon D700. Is it worth it to skip the Nikon D700 and go to the Nikon D800? One question you have to ask yourself is do you shoot video, or are you planning to? The Nikon D700 does not offer HD video shooting while the Nikon D800 does. In my mind, this is the major difference between the Nikon D700 and Nikon D800 and depending on your answer the price you pay for the Nikon D800 &#8211; even though you may end up paying more for it than the Nikon D700 might be worth it.

   <B> <h1><a href="/2012/08/what-is-the-best-sony-5-1-receiver-price/">What is the Best Sony 5.1 Receiver Price?</a></h1></B>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content">Sony receivers for both home theater use and even stereo listening can be great bargains, if you shop around and analyze your needs on what you plan on using the 5.1 receiver for. All come with a plethora of features that include several audio and video inputs, HDMI in and out, and a stereo tuner for AM and FM listening. Of course, being a 5.1 receiver from Sony, that means there are also front speakers, a center speaker and surround speaker connectors to. You&#8217;ll need to buy your speakers for your sony receiver separately, and there&#8217;s too many options to list here today. But, let&#8217;s look at a few Sony 5.1 Receivers and their prices. One of these should be the best Sony receiver for you.

# 

# Sony STRDH520 7.1 Channel 3D AV Receiver

[<img class="size-full wp-image-6169 alignleft" title="best sony receiver" alt="cheapest sony receiver" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Screen-Shot-2012-08-23-at-8.05.56-AM.png" width="461" height="356" />][1]

This Sony is a 7.1 vs 5.1 receiver, but don&#8217;t worry about that as all this means is there are an extra set of surround speaker connectors on the back of the receiver, and you don&#8217;t need to use them if you don&#8217;t need or want to. This is one of the best selling home theater receivers under $300 and definitely worth consideration thanks to it&#8217;s impressive feature set:

  * 100 watts per channel for all seven channels.
  * 6 HD connections. Four are HDMI and 2 component video
  * 3D Pass Thru
  * HD Digital Cinema Sound
  * Dolby TrueHD, Pro logic IIz and dts HD enhanced audio codecs

This is a full featured receiver for both audio and HT from Sony, and the best part is all this[** only costs a little over $200.Â **][2]

But what if you need more features and want to spend a little more money for a Sony receiver to get those features? The Sony mentioned above might be the best budget receiver from Sony, but it may not be the best overall deal. Sometimes, it&#8217;s best to spend a bit more money on a Sony receiver.

# Sony STRDH830 Sony 3D 7.1 Channel A/V Receiver

This Sony [**will cost you a bit more money**][1], double in fact compared to the cheaper STRDH5220 above, but you get one important feature that I think every receiver for 2012 should have, and that&#8217;s iPod connectivity. The Apple iPod has become the defacto standard when it comes to portable music, but when you&#8217;re at home or office you want to listen to something with a little more oooph, and the Sony receiver above offers that in spades and will sound much better than the Apple earbuds that came with your Apple iPod.

The best part? This Sony receiver even includes an Apple iPod dock, unlike some other brands that force you to buy an iPod dock for your stereo or home theater receiver separately. This is the perfect marriage between the two biggest electronics companies in the world today.

Besides the fact that you can use the iPod with this receiver, the Sony STRDH830 also offers more power (140 watts, instead of 100 watts), another HDMI input (5 vs 4), the ability to upscale analog video to 1080i, an advanced on-screen digital display, Digital audio calibration for perfect sound from all your speakers, and Bravia sync so you only need one remote control when used in conjunction with your Sony Bravia HDTV.

Overall, I think that this is the much better value receiver from the two. Yes, you pay more up front, but the higher end Sony includes an iPod dock, and connectivity options, and I know for me, that&#8217;s worth much much more than the minimal increase in cost.

<br>

		<div class="post-content">Boy, if there&#8217;s one theme for 2012 when it comes to releases of new Apple computers, one word comes to mind and that&#8217;s stingy. In recent years we would have had at very least two different models released this year from Apple &#8211; more if you consider items like the Apple iPad too. 

This time last year, we saw new MacBook Pros in Feb 2011, new Apple iMacs in May 2011 and new Apple Mac Minis in July 2011. Yet here it is at August 2012 and the only new model from Apple is the new MacBook Pro&#8217;s (and Air&#8217;s too) but for the most part &#8211; with the exception of the Apple MacBook Pro Retina Display &#8211; all the others considered new are really just the same old notebooks from Apple with faster graphics cards and processors and USB 3.0 ports. 

The l[ast release date for the iMac][1] was in May 2011, so we&#8217;re long overdue for a new consumer desktop of some sort &#8211; even if it&#8217;s not an iMac, there&#8217;s a lot of us who are chained to their desk much more than some other road warriors, and we don&#8217;t need to pay the portable tax of more money for a smaller screen and battery power we don&#8217;t use when we would much rather appreciate a large display and more comfortable ergonomics a desktop system provides. 

That&#8217;s a long time between iMac releases and I&#8217;m surprised that Apple hasn&#8217;t offered up a new iMac for the summer 2012 back to school crowd, or maybe they&#8217;re trying to get this market into their portable notebooks like the MacBook Air or MacBook Pro which probably offer a bigger profit margin. 

I&#8217;m going to guess we will not see an iMac release in August as everybody is on holiday and it&#8217;s way too late to catch the back to school market now. This leaves us with September or October. By then, 90+ days will have passed on the MacBook Pro release date and history shows us that Apple tends to save the fall for the iPods as these are the hottest holiday electronics gift for the holidays year after year. 

We may have to wait until January 2013 to see an new Apple iMac, and my guess is it will be something revolutionary &#8211; like the release of the MacBook Pro Retina Display was for the aging MacBook Pro line. The iMac has essentially been unchanged for years now and for most of us you would be hard pressed to tell one year from another at first glance when comparing iMac models, so it would be very refreshing to see not only a new and improved iMac but also a completely new design too. 

My totally uneducated guess is Apple will wait until the new year the iMac release date. They alreada have a bunch of really great products to get them through the remainder of 2012 and I think they should concentrate their efforts on future products that offer more for Apple and their bottom line. 

As far as computing technology goes an Apple Desktop of any kind is far from cutting edge in 2012 as more and more of us migrate to using portables, tablets and even smartphones.

One of the best things about technology is that sooner or later everything becomes affordable and one area where this is especially true is when it comes to hard drive technology. What once was unreachable for the average consumer is now available on sale for under $50.00 depending on the size of the hard drive you are shopping for.

First, we have to determine whether you need an internal 2.5 inch hard drive or an external 2.5 inch hard drive because in most cases they have different uses. Internal 2.5 inch hard drives usually are available as SATA hard drives and are designed to fit in notebook computers, netbooks or some small desktop computers like nettop desktop computers. You may even find a 2.5 inch hard drive in older Apple TV models too.

External 2.5 inch hard drives, are, as the name implies designed to be connected to your computer externally. In most instances, the only difference between an internal hard drive and an external hard drive is that the small portable external hard drives tend to be powered by an USB port and are compatible with Macs or PCs via the USB 2.0 and USB 3.0 port. External 2.5 inch hard drives are the perfect solution for small and portable storage when need to move files from computer to computer or just need extra room for your music, files, photos or movies to be stored. External 2.5 inch hard drives are also a perfect solution as a backup drive too.

**Where to Buy Under $50.00 2.5 inch Hard Drives. **

One of the first places I check for hard drives of any size is at **<a>Amazon</a>**, as the prices tend to be the lowest and **[there&#8217;s always a hard drive on sale][1].** Another place to check for hard drive deals is [**Crucial**][2], as they too &#8211; after years of selling memory upgrades have ventured into the hard drive arena as well. I find that Amazon is my go-to for anything and not just hard drives and I have found it&#8217;s really hard to beat their price when it comes to finding the best 2.5 inch hard drive for the best price.

   <B> <h1><a href="/2012/08/is-8gb-of-ram-enough-for-photo-editing/">Is 8GB of RAM Enough For Photo Editing?</a></h1></B>

I think so.

Most notebooks today and desktops too, ship with about 4GB of RAM and so I recommend you double the memory on your Mac or PC to 8GB &#8211; especially for photo editing as some of the more advanced processing like sharpening or unsharp mask in Photoshop take a lot of processing and memory power.

Most photo editing software will run fine on less ram, but with 8GB of RAM being so cheap I think if you do any photo editing, even if you&#8217;re just using Apple iPhoto, you would be wise to install the additional memory upgrade.

Minimum memory requirements for the photo editing software just means that the software will open on your Mac or PC and all functions should run. But, they don&#8217;t say how fast the work will get done, and if you really want to increase the photo editing or post processing process in your photography workflow, an 8GB ram upgrade is a no brainer if you ask me.

Some Macs, like the new MacBook Pros and the iMacs will even accept 16GB of RAM which of course doubles the ram from 8GB to 16Gb and speeds up the process when it comes to photo editing even more.

Adding more ram allows your Mac or PC to get more work done faster and avoid the spinning pinwheel as you wait for your computer to catch up with your current photo editing task or function and with ram prices being so cheap, you can fill your Mac or PC with memory for much less than you may think. Â At the time I write this, 8GB is priced about $50, and 16GB runs you double the price at about $100. If you have a new MacBook Pro released this summer &#8211; expect to pay a bit more &#8211; Â especially if you want to max out the MacBook Pro&#8217;s ram to the full 16GB &#8211; current street prices cost about $175.00 for 16GB of RAM

</div>

**In a way, both Crucial and Apple are correct.**

Let me explain:

You see, the Apple iMac last saw a refresh over a year ago, in May 2011and at the time 16gB was the maximum memory supported for the Apple iMac due to the fact that only 4GB memory modules in a 1333Mhz configuration were available and even a year ago it would cost you over $100 for 8GB of RAM for the iMac and a whopping $400 if you bought the RAM from Apple directly.

So, when Apple released the iMac they stated that 16GB was the maximum ram you can buy by upgrading all four available memory slots with 4GB DDR 3 SDRAM sodimms: 4x4GB = 16GB

Fast forward to today where you can buy 8GB memory modules for iMac that were not available at the time of the iMac&#8217;s release date, so in this case Crucial is correct because if you were to buy 4x8GB DDR3 sodimms for the iMac from Crucial you&#8217;d have 32GB installed.

Is It Safe To Install 32GB of RAM into an Apple iMac

Here&#8217;s the tricky part. It&#8217;s more than likely OK that you&#8217;ll be fine installing 32GB of RAM in your iMac and seeing that the recommendation comes from Crucial and not some questionable seller on eBay I&#8217;m going to stick my neck out and say you&#8217;ll probably be fine with the 32GB in your iMac. After all, Crucial&#8217;s big slogan is that crucial memory is guaranteed to work with your computer.

All this said, because Apple states the maximum of 16GB, that&#8217;s where I would stop. Why? Because there&#8217;s a good chance your warranty is toast if you install more than the amount of RAM recommended by Apple at the time of release.

I know that personally, with my Mac Mini bought in March, I stopped at 8Gb even though I could technically install 16GB in my Mac Mini I choose not to because I didn&#8217;t want to void my one year of Applecare and adding more ram than what Apple suggests could do that. Perhaps when I replace the Mac Mini or the Applecare Warranty lapses I may attempt an upgrade of more RAM.

It all comes down to how comfortable you are with voiding your warranty in the rare case that something may go wrong with 32GB of RAM in a 2011 iMac.

I can&#8217;t recommend you go higher than 16GB of RAM, regardless of memory upgrade advice from Crucial.</div>

    <p>
      No.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      If the RAM on your Mac is bad, or has gone bad <strong>it&#8217;s toast.</strong>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Your only option is to replace the RAM with new RAM and if you&#8217;re going to go to the trouble of buying new RAM to replace the dead RAM, I suggest you double (or even triple the RAM too) at the same time for on reason only. RAM is so cheap.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Just like current interest rates the prices have never been so low for so much memory in the over 15 years I have been monitoring RAM prices. It&#8217;s just a few years ago, you would have to pay over $1000 for a 16GB ram upgrade for the iMac and now that same upgrade will cost you nothing at all in comparison &#8211; usually under $100 and even less if you sell your old RAM. (this option may not be available to you if your current RAM upgrade has gone bad)
    </p>
    
    <p>
      But, before you go and replace ram be sure that it&#8217;s gone bad. I know <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/diagnosing-memory-problems-on-your-computer&ei=zBQhUKXIMKK36QHgt4HIBQ&sa=X&oi=unauthorizedredirect&ct=targetlink&ust=1344347092798233&usg=AFQjCNG5ydFAjs1OvQvZX3BSNGyZZVKosg">Microsoft windows offers a memory test option</a>, and you can test the RAM on your Mac too using <a href="http://cdn.command-tab.com/2008/memtest_422.zip">memtest</a>.(direct download link).
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Another option to consider: Is the ram upgrade in your Mac or PC seated properly. I know from personal experience, this has happened to me where I thought I had installed memory on my Mac Mini only to find that I hadn&#8217;t and that the Mac would crash every time I woke from sleep. So I flipped the Mac Mini over, unscrewed the handy plastic cover (if only all Macs allowed such an easy upgrade) and removed and re-installed my memory upgrade ensuring that it was fully installed &#8211; sometimes you have to press hard on the memory module to have the ram seat in the memory upgrade slot correctly.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Once I had re-installed the RAM on my Mac Mini &#8211; all my crashing and startup errors were gone. It wasn&#8217;t the RAM that was bad afterall, it was the crummy installation job by yours truly. Â It costs you nothing to try and reinstall your ram in your computer or complete a full memory test so I suggest you check these two items before you spend your hard earned money on RAM you may not need to buy.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      If it turns out your memory really has gone south, the only option is to replace the RAM, but RAM is so cheap it&#8217;s worthwhile upgrading the RAM over replacing your PC. 8Gb of RAM currently is priced about $50 for most computer models and if your Mac or PC can handle it &#8211; I suggest going all the way to 16GB of RAM with street prices running you only about $100 for 16Gb of RAM today.

The Fiio E9 Desktop Headphone Amplifier is designed to give you more ooomph or power for higher end headphones that are more power hungry, but this Headphone Amplifier is a great bargain to get better sound from your computer thanks to the output power of 1watt at 16 Ohms or 800mW at 600 Ohms. This Headphone Amplifier can be used in multiple modifications &#8211; either in your home audio system with passive loudspeakers or in your computer area with either headphones or both active and passive speakers

I bought the Fiio E9 Headphone Amp for one reason, and one reason only: I wanted a big and easy to use volume button without having to adjust the computer&#8217;s volume via keyboard or a mouse. The extra amplification with the highly regarded Burr Brown OPA2134 Op Amps was really just a bonus. Another reason to buy the Fiio E9 is the fact that it plays very nicely with the [Fiio E7 USB DACÂ ][2]Â I reviewed recently and results in a powerful headphone amp and DAC [all for under $200 on sale][3].

The Fiio E9 Headphone Amplifier is finished in anodized aluminum and feels like a sturdy audio device with a weight of 445 grams, this has a very good feel for it and doesn&#8217;t feel light and cheesy at all.

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5581" title="JIM_5846" alt="JIM_5846" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/JIM_5846.jpg" width="1024" height="734" />][4]

The front of the Fiio E9 Â is where you&#8217;ll find yourself interacting with the unit the most and the design could not be simpler: A big smooth volume button that takes up almost the entire front of the unit accompanied by two headphone jacks &#8211; one for 1/8 (3.5mm) and one for 1/4 (6.35mm) connectors. There&#8217;s also a power indicator light that when first turned on glows red for one second, and then switches to blue. I&#8217;m not sure why they designed this other than to indicate that at first it gets power and then a second later it&#8217;s ready to use? When you turn the power off to about 7pm (as in photo above) the power light obviously goes out too.

I have two complaints about the Fiio E9&#8217;s front. One, after a few months the volume got scratchy when adjusting &#8211; it probably only needs to be cleaned with Â a can of air or possibly contact cleaner, but I have only had this a few months and other items I have owned that have knobs and switches do not seem to be affected by dust Â like the volume knob on the Fiio E9.

The other issue I have is the indented ports on the headphone jacks sometimes mean the headphone jack can easily pop out or it can be hard to seat the jack. This holds especially true with the 1/8th mini jack. I hope that on future products Fiio decides to omit this and sit the headphone jack inputs flush, the same as they are for the 3.5mm ports on the back of the unit.

Speaking of the back of the unit, there&#8217;s more than one way and one port on this headphone amp:

**Line In**Â This port allows you to hook any line output to the Fiio E9. For example, use one of the outputs on your home stereo connected to this port and you can use the headphone Amp with your home audio stereo if it lacks a built in headphone amplifier and output, and even if it does the Fiio E9 will probably sound better anyway. You will need a [rca to 3.5mm adapter cable][6] (not included) to do this. I wish Fiio had also included a RCA left/right input instead of making the input a 1/8inch headphone jack.

**Pre OutputÂ **This allows you to connect the fiio headphone amplifer to an amplifier and use this as a pre-amplifier. You could, for example connect your iPod to the line in port, and connect the pre-out port to an amplifier and use the fiio as a preamplifier. The output from this would be a fixed output, and would bypass the volume control on the Fiio E9. You would use the volume control from your amplifier or if applicable &#8211; your source.

**Line OutÂ **This port allows you to output the sound via a 3.5mm port to an amplifier, and unlike the pre-output option, this allows volume adjustment via the volume knob on the front of the headphone amplifier.

**Gain SwitchÂ **This is pretty self explanatory. If you have sensitive headphones you won&#8217;t need the extra gain, but if you have highÂ impedance headphones flip the gain switch to the up position.

**USB InputÂ **This allows you to connect your computer to the headphone amplifier, but this only works if you[** buy the Fiio E7**][7] as well and connect it to the dock (see the photo below) . If you don&#8217;t and plan on using it just with a line in, you&#8217;ll still get the benefits of the headphone amplifier but miss out on the functionality the USB IN provides

**Power InputÂ **Pretty self explanatory &#8211; you need to plug it in using the included power adapter (see photo below)

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5579" title="JIM_5843" alt="JIM_5843" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/JIM_5843.jpg" width="1024" height="680" />][8]

[click to enlarge photo][8]

The top of the Fiio E9 offers one connection and it&#8217;s proprietary and only works with other Fiio DAC&#8217;s like the Fiio E7. Â I have both the DAC and this amp, and it&#8217;s a match made in heaven as the amplifier charges the fiio E7&#8217;s battery so when you need to use the Fiio E7 as a portable headphone amplifier you&#8217;ll be all charged up and ready to go. When the Fiio E7 is plugged in, the amplification comes from the Fiio E9 and not the Fiio E7. You&#8217;re using the Fiio E7 as a DAC only when docked into the Fiio E9.

## **Fiio E9 SpecificationsÂ **

The biggest specification is more power for your headphones than you could get out of your iPod, smartphone or notebook computer. This is the perfect companion for more power Â hungry headphones. The Fiio E9 ships with loads of power. Using Sennheiser HD 25&#8217;s I am never able than to go louder than 9 o&#8217;clock on the dial for comfortable listening. The texas instruments TPA6120 amplifier offers loads of room and with a total harmonic distortion of 0.00014%, the Fiio E9 offers clean sound.

Two Channel Power output via line out, or 3.5mm and 6.35mm headphone jacks.

On/Off and Mute functions uses sealed relays and and ALPS sealed low noise potentiometer

BB OPA2134 audio butter with low noise, low distortion (0.0008%)

## Fiio E9 Connection Options

Probably one of the bigger features of the Fiio E9 is the choices on how you can use it. Using the USB IN or Line IN, you have six different connection options: (USB In requires [purchase of Fiio E7][12])

**Line In Connection Choices**

1. Source via 3.5mm out to 3.5mm line in to 3.5mm or 6.35mm headphones

2. Source via 3.5mm out to 3.5mm line in to 3.5mm line out to amplifier to speakers

3. Source via 3.5mm out to 3.5mm line in to 3.5mm line out to active powered speakers

**USB In Connection Choices**

4. Computer USB to USB IN to 3.5mm or 6.35mm headphones

5. Computer USB to USB IN to 35mm line out to amplifier to speakers

6. Computer USB to USB IN to 3.5mm line out to active speakers

## Summary

For the money (usually under $100) this is a good looking headphone amplifier that looks good and sounds even better Â &#8211; especially when paired with the Fiio E7 that it was designed for. I find myself listening to music I haven&#8217;t played in years, because the sound is so clear than the sound output I have been used to by using my MacBook Pro&#8217;s headphone amp. I really,really appreciate the old school volume control where a quick tweak of the dial adjusts volume control without me having to stop my workflow to find a sound menu or keyboard button &#8211; this feature alone is worth the price and makes computer audio much more enjoyable.

On good recordings, the sound and power output are nothing less than breathtaking. On lesser recordings this device, like a lot of audio devices that are high quality and don&#8217;t color the sound at all will want you to stop listening, but this is the fault of the original recording and not the Headphone Amplifer. With high quality parts from Texas instruments and with processors and chips usually reserved for high end audiophile equipment costing much more, the Fiio E9 (and matching Fiio E9) could be the best bargain in headphone amplification and listening this year.

  Fiio E7 Portable DAC and Headphone Amplifier
</h2>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  MSRP $99.99 (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003N0XDT4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=ramseeker-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B003N0XDT4"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>much cheaper online at Amazon</strong></span></a>)
</p>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5533" title="JIM_5414" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/JIM_5414.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" />

The Fiio E7 is a very cheap USB DAC and one of the cheapest USB DACs I have used to date. I bought this to partner with the Fiio E9 (review to come) headphone amplifier as I wanted a knob or dial to adjust the volume on my headphones as opposed to having to control the headphone volume with my computer on my Apple Mac Mini. I find that I&#8217;m listening to headphones more and more and I wanted to get better sound out of my Mac. Little did I know how versatile this USB DAC and headphone amplifier is:

The front side of the DAC/Headphone Amp offers what is either a love it, or hate it mirror finish. I&#8217;m not keen on it due the fact that the mirror finish attracts fingerprints easily, and if you&#8217;re using this more as a portable headphone amp for your ipod or smartphone this could be a consideration.

**Fiio E7 Input Options**[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5543" title="JIM_5450" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/JIM_5450.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="507" />][1]

As the photo above shows there are three different ways to get your music to/through the USB DAC/Headphone Amp.

The first is an AUX input that consists of a 1/8 headphone jack allowing you to plug any source into the DAC as long as it has the standard mini headphone jack size for it&#8217;s output Â (or, you can convert it to this. Up next, is a proprietary input jack that can accept accessories such as the Fiio Line out adapter.

There&#8217;s also a line in connector that&#8217;s proprietary for connecting to the Fiio E9 headphone amplifier. This allows you to easily dock the Fiio E7 into the Fiio E9. According to the website this is supposed to make the Fiio E7 sound even better &#8211; probably due to the more power in the Fiio E9

Lastly, the mini USB input for connecting the Fiio E7 to your computer for use as a small headphone amplifier/DAC.

## **Fiio E7 Output Options**

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5542" title="JIM_5448" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/JIM_5448.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="401" />][2]

The flipside of the E7 from Fiio is where you connect your headphones into. Â A nice touch is Â that there&#8217;s two headphone jacks on the top. Â If you plan on using this as a USB DAC I suggest you spend the few dollars and invest in the Fiio Line Out Dock Â that plugs into the Fiio&#8217;s connector on the bottom of the DAC and offers a mini USB input and a true Line Out connector instead of using the headphones. Â It&#8217;s clear that with the omission of Â the line level output as standard equipment that Fiio designed the E7 with the intention of using it as a headphone based unit first and a desktop DAC second. But with a few bucks spent ([under $10 online][3]) you can fix this.

## **Fiio E7 Volume and Controls**

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5541" title="JIM_5447" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/JIM_5447.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="331" />][4]

On the left side of the small DAC and headphone amplifier are four buttons that are pretty self explanatory. Volume Up and Down, Menu Options Â and Exit and Power.

## **Fiio E7 Operation and Menu Options**

Menu Button: Click it once to enter the menu, and twice to enter submenu or to confirm your menu choice. Speaking of choices, the Fiio E7 offers a few different options to control this tiny headphone amp and DAC:

**EQ/Bass Boost.** There&#8217;s 3 different levels of bass boost from 1 to 3. I found I like the 1 setting. Â A true audiophile would have a straight and no processing, but I find for headphone use especially it&#8217;s nice to add a bit more bass.

**USB ChargingÂ **You can choose to turn off the charging when USB is connected. Â I don&#8217;t see a reason why you would need to switch this off, but there you go.

**Sleep Function.** To save battery life set the Fiio E7 to sleep from 10 to 90 minutes at ten minute intervals. Or, turn off the sleep function completely.

**Keylock.Â **Set the Fiio E7 to lock the buttons after a specified time interval Â from 20 to 60 seconds.

**Maximum Volume.Â **This is a very useful to save damage to your ears that could be permanent. You can set the volume from 20 to 60 (the maximum volume) I found [using my headphonesÂ ][5]Â I rarely went past 20 so there&#8217;s lots of extra power to spare assuming you&#8217;re using relatively sensitive headphones.

**Volume MemoryÂ **You can choose to remember what volume you last had when you turned off the Fiio E7 or you can choose not to.

## **Fiio E7 Features and Specifications**

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5544" title="JIM_5479" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/JIM_5479.jpg" alt="" width="608" height="640" />][6]The Fiio E7 is one of the best selling headphone amplifiers Â due to the fact that for the price, this is best value for a feature packed yet portable DAC that&#8217;s just as comfortable with home use as it is portable.

**USB Audio Decoding** The problem with the digital audio converter in your iPod or notebook is that the part is not the same high quality as the parts inside the Fiio E7. Â But with the portable headphone DAC, you can set your computer&#8217; operating system to output the sound via USB which the Fiio can then decode.

**Name Brand Chips for DecodingÂ **The Fiio E7 ships with the Texas Instruments 2706 chip for a USB receiver and for the digital to analog conversion it&#8217; Â powered by Wolfson DAC chips &#8211; the WM 8740

**Built In Headphone Amplifier and Pre Amp**The Fiio E7 pre-amp section is powered with a Texas Instrument TPA6130A for processing and an AD8692 chip for headphone amplifier section.

**Standard 3.5mm Line In JackÂ **I had already mentioned this earlier as this is a great way not only to hook up your iPod or iPad to the Fiio, but also any item that can outuput sound via a very standard and popular 3.5mm headphone port.

**Dual Headphone OutputsÂ **A great way to share your music with others.

**Digital Volume Control** offers fast and precise volume adjustment

**Built In Equalizer** with 3 different levels of bass boost

**Built In BatteryÂ **offers up to 80 hours of use, Â and full charge from USB port in less than six hours.

**Â Specialized Docking PortÂ **for connecting the Fiio E7 to Â the Fiio E9 for even greater versatility and performance.

**Aluminum Case and Small Size **96mm x 55mm x 15.5 mm and weight of just 100g allow it to easily be portable with lightweight and strength of the aluminum case.

**USB Charging OptionÂ **This allows you to turn off the USB charging for even greater performance by allowing you to turn Â off the charging circuitry completely via a menu option. This prolongs the battery lifespan and allows you to achieve even cleaner sound.

**Volume Memory and Maximum Volume **Protect your ears and pick up where you left off when you turn the Fiio E7 back on.

**Automatic Keylock Â **Assures you won&#8217;t bump the buttons when it&#8217;s in your pocket

**Sleep TimerÂ **Saves you on battery life.

## **Fiio E7 Technical SpecificationsÂ **

**No Drivers Needed.** Â Will play fine with all Windows Software and Mac OS Â too.

**Output Power **150mW at 16 Ohms and 16mW at 300 Ohm

**Headphone Impedence Range** 16 Ohm to 300 Ohm

**Signal To Noise Ratio **95db on Line In, 100db on USB In

**Total Harmonic Distortion** .0009% on Line In and Â .0008% on USB In.

**Frequency Range** 10Hz to 100KHz

**Recharging**Â USB 5V DC 400mA

## What&#8217;s in the Box

Fiio E7 Portable DAC/Headphone Amplifier

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5533" title="JIM_5414" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/JIM_5414.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" />][7]

The Box

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5538" title="JIM_5440" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/JIM_5440.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" />][8]

USB 2.0 Cable &#8211; USB Mini to USB A

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5537" title="JIM_5439" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/JIM_5439.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="395" />][9]

Rubber Band. This allows you to wrap this around your iPod or Smartphone and have both the Fiio E7 and your source in one easy group.

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5536" title="JIM_5438" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/JIM_5438.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="506" />][10]

Soft Velvet (faux, I bet) case to protect your Fiio E7 from scuffs and scratches.

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5539" title="JIM_5443" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/JIM_5443.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" />][11]

Rubber Bumper Case protects the Fiio E7 from bumps when used as a portable Â DAC/Headphone Amp[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5535" title="JIM_5437" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/JIM_5437.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="302" />][12]

3.5mm to 3.5mm cable. Connect on end to your iPod headphone jack and the other end to the AUX input on the Fiio E7. (You&#8217;re better off buying the [Fiio L9 L-Shaped iPod Cable][13] for your iPod. This allows a better output on your iPod and bypasses the iPod&#8217;s DAC)

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5534" title="JIM_5429" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/JIM_5429.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="444" />][14]

## **Using the Fiio E7**

Now that we&#8217;ve looked at the specs and stats of the Fiio E7, **how does it sound?**

I found the sound to be accurate in both use as a headphone DAC (I used the Fiio E9 for the amplifier section, bypassing the Fiio&#8217;s amplification) and as a DAC for my home music server via the USB input and both sound great.

The sound is very accurate so if you have an inferior recording, it will show. Â This DAC does not hide or color the sound I have found. For the money I spent on the Fiio E7, this might be the best USB DAC I have used and reviewed to date. With a street price well under the $99.99 MSRP this is a cheap USB DAC and headphone amp that offers great value for those wanting more power and better sound for both their Apple iPods, or home music server systems.

The one thing I could do without is the mirrored finish as it collects fingerprints very easily, Not photographed is the included cleaning cloth to help with this though. Fiio E7 comes with an amazing amount of free accessories too allowing multiple uses and configurations when out and about or use at home with 2 different cases. Â It&#8217;s light, has oodles of power (I never made it past 1/3) has decent specifications when it comes to distortion and well, just sounds great.

## **Where To Buy the Fiio E7**

<div style="float: right; margin-right: 5px;">
</div>

**[I bought mine at Amazon][15]** and I ask that if ****[you&#8217;re considering buying the Fiio E7 online that you do too][15]****. I get a very small commission and your Amazon purchases allow me to buy more stuff to review. Nobody is giving me free products &#8211; I bought the Fiio E7 for review with my own money. This is the same item you will get at purchase and not a review sample or prototype. Thank You.
