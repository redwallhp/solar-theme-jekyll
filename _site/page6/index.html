<p>That’s a question I get asked a lot – probably second after ‘what is the best memory, or what is the cheapest memory. And ramseeker isn’t the easiest to navigate sometimes if you don’t know what type of memory you have I also get asked what ram do I need for my computer? (BTW,  if you need help with your memory upgrades feel free to email me. I’m here to help you with your ram upgrades)</p>

<p>Back to the best RAM brand. There’s two ways you can buy ram: one that will save you the most money or for a little more money you can buy brand name ram which comes with the knowledge that you paid a bit more for your ram but at least it’s a brand name you can trust.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW">Kingston RAM: Best Selling Memory Upgrades</a></strong></p>

<p>This applies to anything, really and not just ram. Even computers are priced this way – you can buy an Apple Computer  (and pay for the privilege) or you can buy a lesser bran  name.  Once I needed a PC to run some windows program so I found the  cheapest laptop I could find. It worked great for the price but support was non-exisitent as when I needed help with my PC (it was a windows machine. it’s only a matter of time before you need help) the company was long out of business. It was a no-name laptop and I got no-name support to match.</p>

<p>With RAM though you’re better off because even generic memory gets tested to work from the memory vendors before it ships and if you buy ram regardless of brand from the stores I list you won’t have a problem with RAM not working. These stores are all reputable memory vendors and I have mentioned this before.</p>

<p>Some brands you might see are toshiba, samsung, micron (which is crucial), lexar for digital camera ram…just to name a few. It all comes down to your comfort level and what’s most  important to you – getting the cheapest RAM you can buy or spending a  littl more for brand name ram. Your budget and memory needs  all come into play when you need to buy memory – brand name or generic, the choice is ultimately up to you.</p>

<p>So you want to know the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/pc/index.php#lowest" title="cheapest pc ram">cheapest ram right now</a>?</p>

<p>Before I can answer that we need a bit of information before I can begin to help you. Do you have a mac or pc? Are you looking for ram for your digital camera? how about a memory stick?</p>

<p>What size of RAM can your mac/pc/digital camera take?</p>

<p>What type of memory can your mac/pc/digital camera use?</p>

<p>We’re not done yet.  Do you have a memory or ram budget? You’re in the market for the cheapest RAM and you’re definitely at the right place but I want you to understand that price – and this is for any thing, not just ram – is only part of the package deal when shopping for RAM and Memory Upgrades</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00200K1SY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00200K1SY"><img title="Cheapest Camera RAM" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-3.43.05-PM.png" alt="Cheap RAM for Digital Cameras" width="290" height="314" /></a></p>

<div>
</div>

<p>Do you care if the ram is name brand ram or are you happy with generic ram? How about used ram? That actually would be the cheapest ram, but it’s used and  any savings you might acquire buy shopping for used ram could be eaten up by support costs and other habits. You can sell your old ram too and that would make your new ram even cheaper or at very least – offset the costs of  ram when you are ready to buy new ram.</p>

<p>How about a gurantee? do you need one?  What if by chance, the ram goes bad. Do you want or need a 1-800 phone number to call? Are you OK with email support? Are you a whiz kid who knows all there ever needs to know about ram and memory and you’re just in the market for the lowest price ram and you don’t care about support for your ram purchase.</p>

<p>These are all things to consider when  you need to buy ram and you are in the need for cheapest ram. The cheapest ram for an older notebook for blogging means a whole other thing if you’re looking to upgrade hundreds of computers at the same time. Saving a few dollars in ram in this case might not be worth it.</p>

<p>How are you going  to pay for the ram . Visa, mastercard?  Paypal? <a href="http://www.canadianonlinebanking.com" title="canadian online banking">wire the money</a> to the vendor? Purchase Order? All of these different payment offer differernt fee structures and payment terms. For the hobbyist a credit card works best probably. For the commercial order you’re probably want to go with a store that will accept your PO. so  you can cross the ‘upgrade office computers’ task off your to do list.</p>

<p>Once you’ve decided  on all these options and probably a few I haven’t even thought of then I can help you<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="buy the cheapest ram"> buy the cheapest RAM </a>for the right price with the right features you need for your application.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2010/08/macbook-pro-memory-upgrade/">MacBook Pro Memory Upgrade</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>As desktop computers become more and more obsolete and notebook computers more and more powerful, especially in the case of Apple Computer and their notebooks that offer processing speed and performance unheard of only a few short years ago more and more Apple customers new and old are looking to upgrade their MacBook Pros with a</p>

<p>I mean ram upgrades for MacBook Pros, not hard drive upgrades for MacBook Pros although those are a good idea with larger hard drives for MacBook Pros being available and newer SSD technology maturing where you get even faster performance out of your MacBook Pro than you ever could with a traditional hard drive.</p>

<p>But for today I mean ram upgrades for your macbook pro. Just a few short years ago, heck even one year ago MacBook Pro RAM or Memory – especially the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_Pro_KITS_(1066_DDR3)-8gb/" title="8GB MacBook Pro RAM">8GB Macbook Pro RAM</a> would set you back a pretty penny, with costs for ram hovering about $1000 to max out your MBP.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_Pro_(1066_DDR3)/" title="macbook pro memory upgrade">MacBook Pro Memory Upgrade</a></strong><br />
[table id=1 /]<br />

<p><strong><a href="&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I">Best MacBook Pro Prices</a></strong></p>

<p>But over time the bigger ram chips or modules get cheaper and cheaper and now 8GB Memory Upgrade Kits aren’t priced too high. OK, they’re still pretty expensive when you compare them to<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_Pro_KITS_(1066_DDR3)-4gb/" title="4GB ram for macbook pro "> 4GB RAM for MacBook Pros</a> and I bet there’s more fun ways to spend your money like on a new iPhone or iPad but for just a few hundered dollars you can achieve maximum performance and speed from your professional macbook from Apple.</p>

<p>And why not upgrade the ram on your MacBook Pro? You already forked over $2000 or more to buy the macbook pro so what’s a few hundred more? In fact, some memory stores will offer you credit for your old MacBook Pro RAM which makes your MacBook Pro memory upgrade even cheaper.</p>

<p>Let’s assume you manage to get $50 for your old ram.  (This is just a guess). As I write this MacBook Pro 8GB Memory Upgrade Kits go for about $250 online. For $200, or less than 1/10th of what you paid for your MacBook Pro in the first place you could be rockin’ it with a MacBook Pro running at full speed. No more annoying  apple multi-colored wheel or progress bar while you wait for your Mac to catch up. This is especially important for processor intensive tasks such as iMovie or Photoshop users.</p>

<p>It always amuses me when I get people looking for the best deal on ram for macbook or the cheapest macbook pro ram. It’s my opinion that a MacBook Pro Memory Upgrade is worth it at any cost with today’s ram prices.</p>

<p>With the latest and greatest new MacBook Pro models released by Apple earlier this spring (2010) one of the best features in my opinion was that the new Apple MacBook Pros could now be fitted with 8GB of RAM, DDR3 1066 RAM specifically made for the Apple MacBook Pros.</p>

<p>[table id=8 /]</p>

<p>I’ve been listing the DDR3 ram for MacBook and MacBook Pro for quite some time now,  but it’s only  been since oh, April 2010 that the 8GB RAM for Apple MacBook Pros really became to be in demand and popular. You probably found this page by searching for macbook pro ram or ram for macbook pro or ddr3 ram or 8gb ddr3 and I won’t disappoint you: you can find the<strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="best price macbook pro 8gb ram"> best price on  MacBook Pro 8GB DDR3 RAM.</a></strong></p>

<div>
</div>

<p>On the page where I list the 8GB MacBook Pro RAM you’ll be looking at MacBook Memory upgrades that are marketed as memory upgrade kits but you shouldn’t dismiss the fact that you might be able to get a better price on MacBook Pro ram by searching for 2x4GB memory upgrades and doing the math yourself.</p>

<p>The memory stores that are online  and carry MacBook Pro RAM are different for each and every one of them as some memory shops prefer to list the MacBook Pro memory  as individual module as it makes it easier for them to list the ram prices individually regardless of what you need – even if you need to install the ram in matched pairs.</p>

<p>Other stores are a bit more savvy with the marketing so they market memory as kits which could result in a higher sale per order. If they can sell you two memory modules instead of one they will. There’s nothing wrong with memory shops trying to increase their memory sales, just like there’s no problem with you wanting to get the best deal you can on MacBook Pro RAM.</p>

<p>And you can get the best deal on ram but you should check both the <a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-1548159-10273954?url=http://www.crucial.com/store/affiliateredirect.asp?imodule=CT51264BC1067&amp;aid=1027395&amp;cid=777292&amp;subid=89&amp;PRS&amp;uscj&amp;cjsku=CT51264BC1067">4GB memory modules for MacBook Pro</a> in addition to the <a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-1548159-10273954?url=http://www.crucial.com/store/affiliateredirect.asp?imodule=CT2KIT51264BC1067&amp;aid=1027395&amp;cid=777292&amp;subid=89&amp;PRS&amp;uscj&amp;cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1067">MacBook Pro 8GB memory kits</a> as there’s a chance one or the other might be the better memory deal for you. ram prices change over time sometimes a memory vendor selling macbook pro memory upgrade kits will have the better deal and some times its memory modules end up being the better ram deal.</p>

<p>Well, it can be expensive or pricey for memory but that just means you’re not shopping hard enough for the best deal on ram, or if you prefer: inexpensive mac memory, or cheap memory for your mac.</p>

<p>The good news is you’re at the right place to get a fair deal on high quality memory upgrades. I’ve been confused in the past as an online store that sells memory but I leave that to the memory professionals such as 18004Mememory, Memory X, OEMPCWORLD, RAMJET, Data Memory Systems, OWC, Crucial Technology  and a few other memory stores that either specialize in Apple memory or memory for your macs for much less than what you might pay from name brand memory stores such as directly from Apple.</p>

<p>If you’re looking for cheap ram from Apple directly you’ll be looking long and hard to fin  some. They do sell ram but it’s expensive: 8GB for MacBook Pro will set you back $600 as opposed to much much less – about half price – when you buy ram from the memory stores I do list.</p>

<p>At one point I used to offer a much longer list of memory stores that sold RAM but they haven’t been in business for decades or even longer. I think OWC has been helping Apple users get a good deal on upgrades since ’88. That’s a long time to be in business and you don’t accomplish that by under selling at the lowest ram price. You get to 25 years in business by supporting the Apple community and making sure you offer a competitive product at a competetive price and that’s what I specialize in: tracking and monitoring ram prices from the memory stores that have been around for some time and offer great deals and more importantly – great support on the products they sell.</p>

<p>Even yours truly has 13 years tracking ram prices so I know a good deal on ram when I see it ( ram just gets cheaper and cheaper year after year) Buy good ram that’s cheap or <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="inexpensive mac ram">inexpensive mac memory </a>from a memory store you can trust and  you will have problem  free computing regardless  what apple computer you have and need to upgrade</p>

<p>Too much.</p>

<p>And that’s how ramseeker was born. I searched and found lots of other memory stores online that offer guranteed memory to fun just fine in your MacBook Pro for much much less than what the RAM costs when buy it directly from Apple.</p>

<p>As I write this it costs <a href="http://store.apple.com/us/memorymodel/ME_17_266_MBP_ICI7" title="8gb macbook pro ram ">$600 for an 8GB memory upgrade kit from the apple store</a> today.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>[table id=1 /]</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-3.48.40-PM.png"><img title="Cheap MacBook Pro RAM" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-3.48.40-PM.png" alt="Best MacBook Pro Memory" width="313" height="293" /></a></p>

<p>Compare that to about $250 for the same RAM from a selection of memory stores that have been in business for at very least a decade if not longer and offer a gaurantee on all ram they sell. That’s fair savings for about ten minutes effort searching online for the best price macbook pro ram, no? If the difference were closer I might even argue ordering that you buy your ram directly from Apple as you have to hand it to Apple, they do support the products they sell. At least in the very few times I have had problems with any Apple products they usually take care of it if the macbook or anything is under warranty.</p>

<p>And you know what will happen if you do have trouble with your ram from third party memory suppliers?  It’s a good guess Apple will blame  the ‘bad ram’ . There was a thing oh, it must be a decade  now where  Apple tweaked the OS a bit and a lot of users were having problems with  their ram not being recognized.  This was kind of a big deal in the Mac web so I got on the phone and called every one of these memory stores I list and every store told me they would replace the ram if their memory was at fault.</p>

<p>When you buy Apple RAM you do get the satisfaction of knowing in the event of something going wrong you’ve got Apple RAM in an Apple Computer and reciepts to back it up making for an easy life in the event you may have trouble.</p>

<p>But I don’t know… that’s a pretty big price premium for MacBook RAM. I guess the question is for you to decide if the price to pay apple for ‘apple’ ram . (which in my personal  macbook was just crucial memory anyway). I vote no. I’m all for getting the most value out of my hard earned money and every store I list memory prices from is reputable and sells MacBook 8GB for much less than what the Apple Store does and yet still offers excellent service and prices.  You can buy 8GB from Apple but it’ll cost you for the privilege. There’s much <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_Pro_KITS_(1066_DDR3)-8gb/" title="cheap macbook pro 8gb ram">cheaper 8GB MacBook Pro RAM</a> available and that’s what I recommend.</p>

<p>What’s the** **<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="best ram for mac mini"><strong>best ram for mac mini</strong></a>?. That’s a question I get and have to answer a lot here so I thought I’d write this to help you when you need to decide on buying mac mini ram.</p>

<p>With the release of the new Apple Mac Mini, Apple’s offering a very powerful computer that’s tiny but if you’ve already have a keyboard and mouse and monitor you can save some money and  just buy a mac mini. Lots of buyers of the mac mini also are using these small apple computers as media servers as more and more entertainment is available to buy online.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-3.56.25-PM.png"><img title="Mac Mini Deals" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-3.56.25-PM.png" alt="Best Price on Mac Mini" width="491" height="216" /></a></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013FK9U2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0013FK9U2">Best Price on Mac Mini</a></strong></p>

<p>Anyway, the <strong>RAM for Apple Mac Mini</strong></p>

<p>If you have the original mac mini that uses PC2700 RAM you might be better off upgrading the mac mini to a newer mac mini model as these tiny macs,while small are getting a wee bit dated and adding RAM may or may not be the best deal depending on how you plan on using the mac mini.</p>

<p>That said, I’ll let you decide and you here’s where you can <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/Mac_mini/" title="best mac mini PC2700">buy the best price on ram for the older mac minis that used the PC2700 so-dimms </a>from a few years back now.</p>

<p>Next up, are the intel core duo and intel core 2 duo mac minis. These are a much better deal and until a month or so ago were the most current mac mini you could buy. These mac minis use the much more technologicially advanced so-dimms that are DDR2 PC5300. The intel core 2 duo <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/Mac_Mini_(PC_5300)/" title="fill a mac mini with ram">mac minis full of ram </a>are a great deal if you can find one for cheap. Tecnically apple states that you should have a ‘apple authorized’ service center install ram on this (and all mac minis, unless they have changed this)  but it doesn’t take long and you can do it yourself easily enough. Chances are if you’re looking to upgrade an intel core 2 duo mac mini the warranty is gone anyway (unless you have applecare).  Best prices for Mac Mini PC5300 DDR sodimms are right here.</p>

<p>Lastly, the new Mac Minis. I’ve written above how these are a great deal so I’ll spare you  but the big deal in my mind is that you can now <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/Mac_Mini_KITS_(1066_DDR3)/" title="fill a mac mini with 8GB of ram">fill a mac mini with 8GB of RAM</a> (4gbx2) if you choose, just like the macbooks – it’s the same ram for Mac Minis. Until recently the  most ram you could install in a Mac Mini was 4GB. Not anymore – with 8GB of ram or memory the new Mac Mini is a powerful and versatile apple computer and also the <strong>cheapest mac you can buy.</strong></p>

<p>Let’s get this cleared up right away, whatever the price – whether it’s the lowest price or the highest price it doesn’t really matter: <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="memory and ram">Memory and RAM</a> are the same thing and can be used or interchanged when talking about upgrades for your computer. RAM is an acronym for random access memory. See? the RAM name even has the word memory in the description.</p>

<p>But enough about that. What about the prices you say ?  You want memory prices (or ram prices) and that is why you’re here. You plunked some terms into google or bing or MSN or whatever search engine and you’ve landed here looking for (I’m going to guess here) the best ram prices for you computer.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW"><img title="Best Apple Memory Upgrade" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-4.04.05-PM.png" alt="Best RAM Upgrade" width="531" height="274" /></a></p>

<p>Congratulations! You’re here. At ramseeker all I do is track ram and memory prices from online stores you can trust (there was a time I would track prices from everybody, but oh boy the complaints).  Yes I said trust.</p>

<p>You’ve seen  the ‘lifetime guarantee’ stickers on the websites if you have been shopping for ram for any length of time. My first response to these guarantees is to ask ‘who’s lifetime?’  – mine or the store getting my money.</p>

<p>Well, let me tell you about all the memory stores on ramseeker. Every one has been in business selling and supporting nothing but memory (well, that’s a lie – a few sell hard drives and others stuff too)  and they have been in business for at very least: 10 years, most closer to 15 years and then in some cases over twenty years of experience selling ram at the best fair price they can, that is made and manufactured to exact specifications supplied by the manufacturer.</p>

<p>You really can’t go wrong regardless of  what memory price you choose if you stick  to my list of approved memory stores. In fact if the small chance you do buy memory from any one of the memory vendors I list on ramseeker and you do have a problem. ( I can remember 1 time in 13 years,  I think) I’ll help you to try and get it sorted out.</p>

<p>But that won’t happen if you use a memory store I list. The same can’t be said if you end up on eBay or craigslist and you buy some crappy memory from somebody somewhere else. If you buy cheap ram elsewhere that’s great but ask yourself how long they’ve been in business. I make my living with my computer. My time is money and I want to install the ram I can find at the best price and forget about ram and memory prices until I need to buy more ram.  I suggest you do the same and save yourself  a world of troubleshooting. Buy quality memory from quality ram stores and be happy with your purchase.  Yes it’s that easy to get the best memory price and be happy with your ram.</p>

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p> <br />
That’s great that you need the best ram upgrade for iMac but the very first thing we need to do is figure out which apple iMac you use. Maybe you already know this as some apple  fans and websites have a lot of knowledge about all the different types of iMacs and not just ram so if you’ve come with the knowledge of what ram you need for your particular iMac feel free to skip ahead and start to <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="shop for iMac Memory">shop for iMac Memory now</a>.<br />
I track and monitor memory prices on a whole bunch of different iMacs over the years and Apple has this annoying  habit of just calling the iMac ‘iMac’ regardless of year or design. They’re all just iMacs according to Apple and the latest is the ‘iMac’ model that was just released. This has been called different names to differentiate between the older models. I have seen the new iMac as iMac Summer 2010 or iMac mid July or if you’re me I classify the Apple iMacs by ram types they use.If you’re looking for the <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="best ram upgrade for iMac">best ram upgrade for iMac </a></strong>you’ve definitely come to the right place.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8IO6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8IO6">Best Apple iMac Prices</a></strong></p>

<p>But for the rest of us: a little lesson on how to find out what  iMac you have, or at very least I want to help you figure out what RAM you need for iMacs. Here’s how and this technique will work not only with iMacs but with  MacBooks or any other apple computer too.</p>

<p>Go to your apple menu in the left hand corner.</p>

<p>Select: About this Mac</p>

<p>Up comes a window that tells you how much RAM you have and how to see what RAM  you need.</p>

<p>Here’s mine: It’s a MacBook. I know this because apple has screen printed it right on the screen for me to see – nice and handy.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>It will show the processor speed. This is good and in my case I have a MacBook Pro 2.4Ghz. I’ll write this down.</p>

<p>Then I see I have 4GB of RAM installed already (which is the maximum already). And this ram runs at 1067mhz., which is real close to the 1066Mhz RAM I need to buy ( apple rounds up the speed of the memory. My macbook pro ram runs at 1066.6 Mhz , so apple calls it close enough to 1067MHz)</p>

<p>In my case I know know I have a MacBook Pro 2.4GHz and it runs at 1066Mhz, so if I were to shop for ram for my macbook  I would want to buy MacBook Pro 1066Mhz RAM</p>

<p>And that’s all there is to it to find out how much ram  you have. If you need help figuring any of this out be sure to contact me and I’ll be happy to help you get the best RAM upgrade for your iMac or any computer.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2010/08/4gb-ram-for-black-macbook/">4GB RAM for Black MacBook</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001265GI2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001265GI2">Cheap MacBook Memory</a></strong></p>

<p>It depends on which particular black macbook you have but you may be able to install up  to 6gb of RAM inside a black macbook. You would do this by installing one 4GB memory chip into one memory slot while with the other memory upgrade slot you install a 2 gb memory module.</p>

<p>The black MacBooks either max out at 2 GB of RAM or 4GB of Memory depending on what model you have. The later Apple MacBooks will run up to 6GB of memory unofficially, meaning that it’s not supported or documented by apple and some of the earlier models will recognize 3GB of RAM.</p>

<p>Personally, I don’t think it’s worth the bother to upgrade your Black MacBooks past what is recommended by Apple as I think you’re just asking for trouble. Just because you can, doesn’t mean you should.</p>

<p>The intel core duo black macbooks released in 2006 will max out at 2GB of  PC5300 DDR2 RAM.  You will need to buy <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_(PC5300_DDR)-1gb/" title="black macbook 1GB RAM">2x1GB PC5300 DDR sodimms </a>to get the maximum RAM  for this black macbook model</p>

<p>The intel core 2 duo <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_(PC5300_DDR)-1gb/" title="2gb ram black macbooks">black macbook models also max out with 2GB of RAM </a>and the same  memory configuration is required: 2x1GB PC5300 DDR sodimms are needed to get the maximum ram</p>

<p>The intel core 2 duo black macbooks with the ‘santa rosa’ processor will take more ram than the 2GB of predecessors and will recognize <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_(PC5300_DDR)-2gb/" title="black macbook 4GB RAM">4GB of ram by installing  2x2GB PC53000 DDR so-dimms. </a></p>

<p>the 2008 intel core 2 duo black macbook will also take 4GB by replacing the standard memory that came from the factory with<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_(PC5300_DDR)-2gb/" title="2x2GB for black macbooks"> 2x2GB 4GB memory upgrades for black macbook </a></p>

<p>So yes, you could squeeze either 3GB or 6GB into your black macbook depending on what particular black macbook model you have but it’s not something I can recommend. Some trusted memory vendors (OWC comes to mind) say that the larger memory will work just fine with the dark colored apple notebooks but I can’t recommend it and sleep at night.</p>

<p>But for the later black macbooks there’s no reason why you can’t<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="4gb ram for black macbooks"> install 4GB RAM for Black MacBook</a> and rest assured your black macbooks will run just fine with the ram maxed out at 4GB.</p>

<p>RAM prices drop over time. They just do. Especially for the latest and greatest memory for your apple, dell, sony or toshiba as these days all computer brands use the same memory types and sizes but over time ram prices drop:</p>

<p>Here’s an example for iMac Memory:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2010-08-09-at-4.33.42-PM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-212" title="ram prices drop over time" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2010-08-09-at-4.33.42-PM.png" alt="imac ram prices get cheaper" width="523" height="319" /></a></p>

<p>Wild eh? (there’s my canadian showing). The iMac RAM (this particular graph is from 2008 data) dropped from $90 to $40 over the period of the year. That’s a resonable savings over the price of the year.</p>

<p>Can you afford to wait for ram prices to drop? Let’s pretend you make your living with your iMac, or any computer it doesn’t matter but you make money online with your computer. Maybe you’re a photographer who uses photoshop or a writer or maybe you just blog and hope to make a few bucks here and there.. it doesn’t really matter what computer you use or what you do to make money with your computer: my question to you is : what’s it worth to you to wait until ram prices drop?</p>

<p>About a year ago you would have to pay about 1000 dollars to upgrade your iMac to the maximum at the time. The Mac web went crazy! ‘what – they cried – that’s almost the sam price as the iMac!’ What they didn’t realize that for some, even at $1000 for memory upgrades was still the bargain of the year.  If you’re making money with your computer either offline or  online it doesn’t matter the $1000 is the biggest bargain for memory if it means more work getting done easier and smoother.</p>

<p>A lot of people think that the lowest price on ram is so important, but if you make more than that with your skills, your computer and your maxed out memory  the price of the upgrade is really not an issue, especially when you amortize the ram costs over the time you own your computer. I’ve worked it out in other posts, but the ram for my MacBook Pro works out to about $4 a month. Pretty cheap ram if you ask me.</p>

<p>Granted, you could wait for ram prices to drop and as you see in the image above they do – and usually the ram prices drop pretty fast for newer models as more and more memory gets manufactured and  there’s more places to <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="buy ram and memory ">buy ram and memory</a> for your new computer it only makes sense that demand will grow and prices will drop.</p>

<p>The question really is: Can you afford to wait for ram prices to drop, and not <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/pc/" title="when will ram prices come down?">when will ram prices come down</a>?</p>

<p>Wow. <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">8GB RAM for Apple MacBook Pros</a> sure have dropped over the past year or so. I think it was the fall of 2008 when the Unibody 17 inch MacBook Pro was released from Apple as it was the very first Apple MacBook Pro to accept and acknowledge 8GB of RAM Memory Upgrades.</p>

<p>[table id=1 /]</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MX5YWI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001MX5YWI"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1336" title="Cheap MacBook Pro RAM" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-3.48.40-PM.png" alt="Best MacBook Pro Memory" width="313" height="293" /></a></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MX5YWI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001MX5YWI">Cheap 8GB MacBook Pro RAM</a></strong></p>

<p>With 8GB of RAM installed inside a MacBook Pro you could essentially use the MacBook Pro as a desktop replacement – especially the 17 inch version of the Apple MacBook Pros with it’s super big and bright LCD display you really didn’t need an external monitor or any other third party display (of course you could hook up the Apple MacBook Pros to an Apple Cinema Display and really benefit from the maxed out ram and you would have two displays to see all your work at a glance.)</p>

<p>But the downside of buying 8GB of RAM for MacBook Pros back then was the price. To buy 8GB of RAM for the Apple MacBook’s you’d have to fork over almost one thousand of your hard earned dollars to upgrade the ram in your macbook pro to the maximum ram avialable. Heck you could pretty much buy a macbook for the same price as some memory stores were charging for MacBook Pro RAM at the time.</p>

<p>But good things come to those who wait – especially in  the  technical or computer  industry where the rule is that the stuff gets faster and bigger while the price usually gets cheaper.  And for those looking to buy RAM or Memory that’s a good thing because now your MacBook Pro 8GB RAM Memory upgrade isn’t all that pricey – especially when you compare it to years past where you would have to pay a pretty hefty premium to be able to use and afford 8GB of Memory in a MacBook Pro.</p>

<p>As I check the latest <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="ram prices">ram prices </a>on ramseeker I find that at the time of writing,  I can grab 8GB of RAM from many memory stores that are trusted and recommended, such as other world computing, Memory X, 18004Memory, Data Memory Systems and Crucial Technology  – they all offer 8GB of RAM KITs for a pretty good deal – especially when you combine the 8GB RAM and install it in a new MacBook Pro (Spring 2010).  As I write this, the best price for 8GB of RAM for MacBook Pros go for about $250.00 which is a far cry from the $1000 or so you would pay just a year or so ago.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_Pro_KITS_(1066_DDR3)-8gb/" title="MacBook Pro 8GB Memory">MacBook Pro 8GB RAM</a> Prices sure have dropped over time.</p>

Want to know a little secret? RAM for all current Apple Computers are all pretty much the same. So when you ask me: Hey, Jim – what’s the cheapest mac mini ram? you could also be asking about the cheapest macbook ram and macbook pro ram too.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013FK9U2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0013FK9U2">Cheapest Apple Mac Mini</a></strong></p>

<p>Assuming of course, that your memory requirements are the same speed. ie: 1066MHz macbooks and macbook pro’s and  the newer mac mini’s all use the same ram. iMac too, until about a week or so ago when Apple released the new Apple iMacs – they use DDR3 1333 RAM Memory so you can’t swap it out with the other Mac models. Yet, anyway.  If Apple has released the new iMacs you can guess that the notebook computers will soon be using the 1333 MHz  speed too over time.</p>

<p>Anyway, you’re here because you want to know the cheapest Mac Mini RAM, and I’m happy to help but we need to know a few things first. Most important is what Mac Mini?  Some of earlier Mac Minis used DDR PC2700 SDRAM and then when the intel based Mac Minis came out for years they required the use of DDR2 PC5300 so-dimms and thing s pretty stayed the same for a year if not more and then finally apple released the Mac Mini’s that required the DDR3 1066MHz so-dimms and currently are the faster and most popular ram for Mac Mini computers.</p>

<p>How to find out how what ram you need for your specific Mac Mini is pretty easy:</p>

<p>Go to your Apple Menu in the top left corner of the screen and select ‘about this mac’. What comes up is a screen that shows you how much ram you have installed, and most importantly – what speed of RAM for your Apple Mac Mini you need to buy. Once you’ve got all this info you’re off to the races and you can see the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="cheapest mac mini ram">cheapest mac mini ram </a>at a glance here on ramseeker:</p>

<p>Use the links above and you will find the the cheapest mac mini ram from the 3rd party memory stores I list, (and have been listing for 13+ years now).</p>

<p>One last word of caution: I don’t think the Mac Mini RAM is supposed to be installed by a  “Apple Authorized Service Provider” At least the <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2616" title="mac mini ram install">older Mac Minis had this requirement</a> and I can’t see any reason why this would have changed.</p>

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><div style="float: right; margin-right: 5px;">
</div>

<p><strong>June 2012</strong> – You can now, at long last install 16GB of RAM into a MacBook Pro into the Newest 2012 13 inch and 15 inch Apple MacBook Pro models, but if you want to buy the MacBook Pro with Retina Display you’re hosed when it comes to installing ram after purchase. Like the MacBook Air the ram on the soon to be best selling MacBook Pro is soldered to the motherboard and thus, unremovable and not able to accept an upgrade.</p>

<p><strong>September 2011.</strong> <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/">Crucial Technology</a> now carries <a href="http://www.kqzyfj.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT102464BF1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT102464BF1339">8GB DDR3 SODIMMS</a> at reasonable prices making the 16GB MacBook Pro RAM Upgrades affordable for professionals needing the most RAM possible for the Apple MacBook  Pro.</p>

<p>[table id=15 /]</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>:16GB RAM for MacBook Pro is now available from <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/2011-apple-macbook-pro-16gb-memory-upgrades/">OWC</a> and more memory vendors as time goes by. At the time I write this, 16GB MacBook Pro RAM is far from cheap and might cost more than the MacBook Pro you intend to install it in. Check here For <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_Pro_DDR3_1333Mhz_Memory_Upgrade_Kits-16gb/">current MacBook Pro RAM 16GB prices</a></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002YUF8ZG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002YUF8ZG">8GB DDR3 for Apple MacBook Pro </a></strong></p>

<p>Two words: not yet.</p>

<p>For 16GB MacBook Pro RAM at the time being anyway. 8GB is the most memory you can  install in the MacBook Pros currently.  This will change I guarantee it. The question is: when? When will I be able to install and use MacBook Pro RAM that’s 16GB?</p>

<p>When did Apple release the last batch of MacBook Pros? Spring 2010, right? And just a week or so ago, Apple announced the new iMacs and they can easily use 16GB of RAM and are the first to do so ( Well,…OK, the Mac Pro’s too, soon enough).</p>

<p>But when will the MacBook Pros be able to use 16GB of Memory  (wow, I remember when 16MB was a lot of ram for an apple computer). I would guess we will see new MacBook Pros in late fall or MacWorld 2011 might be a good time to announce the new MacBook Pros too. (this assumes Apple releases computers only arranged around the Macworld shows which doesn’t seem to be the case lately. This used to be a big deal – the macworld trade shows, but with the internet growing and growing you don’t have to have a trade show much any more really. If Apple sneezes it’s online or tweeted or live blogged  in milliseconds anyway)</p>

<p>Back to my crystal ball gazing about when we’ll see new MacBook Pros that could take 16GB of memory and as I said earlier: late 2010 or early 2011. I have NO inside info, but this is just an educated guess.  It might be later if apple just does a simple speed bump to the MacBook Pros and uses the same 1066MHz memory.</p>

<p>The biggest problem with squeezing 16GB into a MBP is just that: room. Pretty much every Mac portable has offered 1 and lately two memory upgrade slots, for the simple reason that as small as they are: so-dimms are still pretty big and there’s also lots of other things in your apple notebook that needed to be squeezed into tight spaces too.</p>

<p>So that means that we could be waiting for a bit. Assuming only 2 memory upgrade slots, there would have to be not only the technology to recognize and accept 16GB on any new future MacBook Pros there would also need to be 8GB macbook memory modules which I have yet to come across.</p>

<p>If you’re looking for 16GB MacBook Pro RAM you might be waiting for a while until the technology catches up. It will, it’s just a matter of when you can <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="16GB MacBook Pro RAM">buy 16GB MacBook Pro RAM</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_Pro_KITS_(1066_DDR3)-8gb/" title="macbook pro 8gB">8GB Memory MacBook Pro</a> prices are much more reasonable in price currently than they have been in the past.  In the past to upgrade your Apple MacBook Pro with 8gb of ram would have cost the same as a new macbook with memory prices for macbook pro being almost 1000 dollars you have to have deep, deep pockets to upgrade your macbook pro to 8GB total and unless you we doing high intensity work that required the most ram for whatever the cost such as photoshop or image editing or working with movies whether it be final cut or iMovie you might be inclined to stick with the stock ram in your mbp as upgrading  to 8GB MacBook Pro Memory sure was pricey.</p>

<p>That was then and this is now and for a few reasons, it makes a lot more sense to buy ram for your macbook pro. Especially now, with the back to school season and soon after the holiday shopping for 2010 season upon us sooner than we’d like it might make sense to upgrade with 8GB ram now.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MX5YWI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001MX5YWI">Cheap 8GB MacBook Pro RAM</a></strong></p>

<p>It’s always been my thought – and this applies to all memory upgrades whether it’s for apple notebooks or desktops is to max out the ram.  Adding the maximum ram  to your MacBook Pro means you only pay once for memory upgrades and then you’re done. My current computer is a macbook pro personally and I coughed up $100 (yes, I buy ram just like you) and maxed out my macbook pro and it just works. It will be close to two years with the same computer so my memory upgrade cost me about  $4 a month over the two years. That’s the same price as a fancy cup of coffee.  I have forgotten about my memory upgrade since as I bought my ram from a reputable memory vendor that sells quality ram built to apple specifications but without the extra price you can  sometimes pay when shopping for ram from Apple directly.</p>

<p>8GB of RAM is the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="most ram installed">most ram you can currently install</a> into a MacBook Pro and I suggest you do just that. As I write this 8GB will set you back about  $250 or so from many vendors for the 8GB MacBook Pro memory kits. Not the cheapest ram you can buy, no. $250 would buy a lot of cool apple toys like an ipod, or iphone or some other apple software or accessor but it won’t let you get your work done faster. We’re going to assume you’re a pro as you bought  the pro macbook for the extra features so you could benefit from bigger display, more speed , etc and you paid a pretty penny to do so. It only makes sense to squeeze the most you can out of your MacBook Pro and  install the maximum ram you can too. I bet if you’re making a living or even freelancing part time you’ll make the money back that you spent to buy 8GB Memory MacBook Pro in no time.</p>

<p>When you consider adding ram to a computer there’s a lot more to ask yourself  rather than just what’s the best memory deal I can get?  In fact, I have found that the best ram prices have very little to do with what you need when you consider<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="buy memory"> buying more memory</a> for your Apple or PC computer.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-4.28.41-PM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1360" title="Best Toshiba Laptop" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-4.28.41-PM.png" alt="Cheap Toshiba Notebook" width="643" height="429" /></a></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004G8QQ2I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004G8QQ2I">Cheap Toshiba Notebook Computers</a></strong></p>

<p>It doesn’t matter whether you have the latest computer or even a brand new computer you should  always  buy new ram not used memory. Yes, you can save money when you buy ram but you have absoltutely no gaurantee on the memory preformance. It’s quite possible you could damage your computer with used ram and that’s why I always recommend you start your search for memory here. I have been listing and tracking the best prices on ram from the best memory stores for longer than I care to share. Ok , since you asked I  have thirteen years experience with ram and memory upgrades and I have saved thousands of people just like you money on new computer ram upgrades from manufacturers like Apple, Dell, HP and Compaq. I guess I should also list<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/pc/" title="sony ram"> Sony RAM</a> and Toshiba memory too. You can get a great deal on ram when you shop for ram online.</p>

<p>I mean really, if the memory is designed to work and and is compatible with  both Macintosh and  Windows OS (or operating systems as they are sometimes called) does it matter where you bought the memory.</p>

<p>I can understand why you would  want to buy an apple computer as they offer good design and relatively and arguable affordability. The new Macs – and I mean all of them from <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/iMac_(DDR3_1333)/" title="imac ram memory">iMac</a> to <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_Pro_KITS_(1066_DDR3)/" title="macbook pro memory">MacBook Pros </a>to<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/Mac_Pro_(DDR3_1066)/" title="mac pro memory"> Mac Pros</a> they all offer value and that’s why they are the best selling computers today when you factor in ease of use and lack of viruses when all you want to do is surf the web and get some work done.</p>

<p>Maybe your’e here because you heard or read somewhere that the easiest computer upgrade you can do is to add ram or memory and  it’s true. RAM is so cheap these days.</p>

<p>I remember when I started to look  for the best deals on RAM and this is a time when even 1GB of RAM for a computer was astounding and a store online started to carry and sell 1GB RAM and I had to check with the store to be sure they hadn’t made a price mistake as the 1 GB of ram at the time was priced  at $2500. Wow, those were the days.</p>

<p>Fast forward to today where you  would  have a hard time even spending $2500 on an entire computer, let alone an upgrade for the computer. We’ve come a long way, baby – like the old cigarette ads used to say (I’m dating myself here)</p>

<p>But now it’s 2010 and all you wan to know is how much is memory? What does RAM cost ? Is there a gaurantee?  Does the RAM come with free shipping? How long has the memory store been in business. Is my credit card data with the memory store secure?</p>

<p>If you don’t ask all these questions when you are looking for the best price on ram and memory upgrades you should be. It’s your hard earned money you’re spending and lots of memory companies want to sell you ram so they can stay in business and profit.</p>

<p>You wan to save money on RAM which is why you searched for “what is the price to add ram to a computer” in  the first place. If you didn’t care you would just call dell or apple or  toshiba or wherever and pay full price or even more than full price for ram.</p>

<p>But if you do your homework you can not only save money on memory upgrades you can sleep better at night knowing you did the work and didn’t spend all your money on RAM when you have other expenses.</p>

<p>The good news is you are here and you want to know the price for computer upgrades and let me tell you, you’ve come to the right place. Where else can you buy ram from a selection of memory store that all offer the  best ram prices in some way. You’ll notice I didn’t say the lowest ram prices because you must consider other factors when buying ram such as frees shipping and customer service and all those other factors to consider when buying memory upgrades that I listed further up this article.</p>

<p>But if price is your main concern for modern computers in 2010 regardless of make or model they all pretty much can benefit for a DDR3 1066 or sometimes DDR3 1333 ram upgrade. Yes, there’s still a bit of demand for older memory chips as some schools and  cheap business (cheap people too) used older computers and are looking to squeeze every last drop of performance out of their computing dollar and a memory upgrade does just that. Dollar for dollar a ram upgrade is the best upgrade you can do for your desktop or notebook computer today.</p>

<p>Right, price.  ram prices change so much over time by the time I hit publish the ram prices will be old news and new ram modules will have become available. What usually happens is this: new ram is made. it’s pricey as it’s expensive. An example would be the 1GB ram when it first came on the market. You had to have very deep pockets to afford  1GB of ram a decade or so ago. We are seeing the same with newer ram modules too. 8GB for your iMac or MacBook Pro  if you’re an Apple fan is not cheap. Yet.</p>

<p>Notice that I said: Yet. The ram prices for expensive ram will drop and drop and drop until the demand  lowers and then the prices for ram for your older computer by this time will actually increase a bit as the demand has dropped so the prices have to rise.</p>

<p>But as I write this, I find that spending $100 or even less on memory upgrades will allow you get the maximum performance out of your computer and the price to add ram to you computer rarely exceeds the $100 price for most modern computers today.  There are a few exceptions to this rule as some of the professional computers need  more expensive memory. This makes sense in my thinking – if you are making a living with your computer you should expect to pay more for a memory upgrade than grandma who is just emailing the grand children on her netbook.</p>

<p>Regardless, RAM prices are cheap and I fully endorse that you should upgrade ram to the fullest and maximum you can afford for memory upgrades</p>

<p>I wish <a href="http://www.apple.com" title="apple">Apple</a> would release their models yearly instead of the way they do because after a while when you go to look up your iMac model you almost need a PHD to figure out what model of iMac you have and if you’re upgrading what iMac RAM or Memory you need to buy.  They do much better with  their releases of their phones which seem  to come out yearly now and the naming is a little easier to understand the iPhone 3 was in ’08 and then came the iPhone 3GS and lastly even with all it’s antenna problems has been named the iPhone 4.  Somewhere it makes sense to just upgrade the innards and keep it all the same as far as computer names but it sure was a lot easier when there was only one iMac, not many many different Apple iMac Models from which to choose.</p>

<p>Rant over,  Apple released new Apple iMac models earlier this week and I have already found some stores that carry <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/iMac_(DDR3_1333)/" title="Imac RAM">iMac RAM</a>. Its’ still early days but the stores that are the price leaders usually don’t cater to Apple Memory per se,  but carry computer memory for all types of RAM and not just Apple.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>[table id=2 /]</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8IO6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8IO6"><img title="IMac Deals" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-4.34.06-PM.png" alt="Best iMac Price" width="544" height="412" /></a></p>

<p>But those that are more in tune with the Apple market and Apple community tend  to get their Apple RAM listed first as they can do it  themselves and updated their pages to add apple iMac memory. Heck, one store even sent  me a press release saying  that they now carried the Apple iMac Memory for the new Apple iMac  2010. I’m going to call it that I think because this really is new and  released just in time for those wanting to buy a new Apple Computer for back to school or the Christmas holiday shopping season. Apple even has a deal now where if you buy a mac you get a free iPod too.</p>

<p>But, we’re here today to talk about RAM for the new iMacs.  As always I am  relectunt to tell you to buy from one specific memory store because it’s your money not  mine. But I can tell you that Crucial Technology, Other World Computing, Data Memory Systems and RAMJET all offer ram for the new iMacs in stock and ready to ship.</p>

<p>This ram is new to the Apple lineup and the first to include the DDR3 1333MHZ specification, so all or any memory you have from older Apple iMacs won’t work in the new Apple iMac models. You’ll have to buy new ram upgrades to upgrade the new Apple iMacs.</p>

<p>The other good news with  the release of  the summer 2010 iMacs  is they can accept more ram  – up to 16gb if your budget allows for it as there’s four memory slots on each of the new Apple iMacs and each slot can take 4GB of RAM.  So you could have 4GB, 8GB or 16GB memory upgrade configurations on the new iMacs.</p>

<p>Where do you buy the best 4GB RAM for MacBook?</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000K1KTNW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000K1KTNW">Cheap MacBook RAM</a></strong></p>

<p>That’s a very good question but it comes down to what you think best means. You might be looking for the lowest price on 4GB for MacBook or you might want to buy ram for macbook that can get to you the fastest as possible with overnight delivery and free shipping too if you can swing it. I have found to get free shipping on ram you have to spend $100 as a minimum  and unless you buy two 4GB ram for macbook or more you may not qualify for frees shipping when buying ram.</p>

<p>But then there’s another question:  what macbook? And you  can’t specify just ‘white macbook’ or even ‘black macbook’ as even with those two choices, it does specify things a bit and your macbook ram choices are narrowed down but that’s still not enough really. One way to figure out what type of ram you need is to go to the top left corner of your macbook pro and select ‘about this mac’ where you’ll see that the info provided will provide you with the speed of your computer  memory which might be helpful.</p>

<p>For a long time the macbooks  couldn’t take  or accept 4GB  RAM as they maxed out at 2gb of RAM with 2x1GB PC5300 DDR so-dimms for macbook being the only and biggest ram memory upgrades you could get. Then over the years memory for MacBooks got cheaper and it was found that some of the macbooks would acceptt 3GB of Macbook RAM with  a 1GB ram chip in one slot  and  a 2GB memory chip in the other.</p>

<p>And for a while that was the biggest macbook memory you could get.  But time marches on and  Apple released newer macbooks that shipped standard from the factory with <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_(1066_DDR3)-2gb/" title="2gb macbook ram">2GB of MacBook </a>RAM but you could pull the 2x1gB macbook memory and make keychains out of it or sell the ram on craigslist to offset the costs you could then take your  new found wealth and buy 2x2GB of RAM which  made your macbook run faster and would help you get to the the best <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_KITS_(1066_DDR3)/" title="best 4gb ram macbook">4GB of RAM for MacBook. </a></p>

<p>Fast forward to today, and there’s been a few speed bumps and some cosmetic changes to the Apple MacBook but for the most part it still looks and feels the same as the older macbook computers but these new macbooks  due to the faster processors  all used DDR3 1066 memory and the latest and greatest macbooks  still only accept 4GB of ram at most  and like all the others will require you to remove or replace the 2x1GB RAM chips and replace them with 2x 2GB Macbook RAM which will give you 4GB of RAM.</p>

<p>So now you know the history of the MacBook and how over time you could double the macbook ram from 2gb to 4gb you still cannot put 8GB  of RAM  into a MacBook and for that you’ll need to buy a MacBook  Pro which is much more expensive than a MacBook but offers a few advantages too  – one being the 8GB memory maximum for MacBook Pro .</p>

<p>The<strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="best 4gb ram for macbook"> best 4GB RAM for MacBook</a></strong> is when you buy ram from reputable memory stores that offer great prices and also a great prices on ram for MacBooks too.  Just remember to shop for RAM for MacBooks from a store that you can trust.</p>

<p>Ram Prices for 8GB RAM for MacBook Pro will, and do change over time. When you look or serarch  for 8 gigabytes of computer memory to to go inside or to be installed into a MacBook Pro you’r  really looking for 2x4GB memory modules because at the time of writing 8GB can only be installed in the newer MacBook Pro models from Apple and not all.</p>

<p>You can take the easy way out and<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="buy 8GB RAM"> buy 8GB of RAM</a> directly from Apple, but usually – and they’ve come a long way in the past few years  – yo will usually end up paying more for the MacBook RAM when you pick it up  from Apple. I’m not you so I don’t know and for you you might be worthwhile when you wan to Buy a MacBook Pro you don’t want to jerk around with having to buy your Mac from Apple and then your apple ram from another memory supplier or store. I get that. I’m a big fan of easy.</p>

<p>But how hard can it be? Order the MacBook  from whomever,  but buy your memory from a memory store you can trust. It just so happens that I  know a few stores that are reputable where you can get a pretty good deal on MacBook Pro memory.  Over the years I have personally used every vendors ram that I list without problem. In fact back in about 98 ( I know, you were 8) there was some sort of kerfuffle about some macs not recognizing the RAM and the Mac Web was all uptight – what if their memory didn’t work?  Nobody knew and nobody  bothered to pick up the phone  and ask: If I have ram trouble with your memory, then what happens? Such a simple question so I picked up the phone ( land line back in the day)  and called every memory store. Every store but one said without a doubt they fully guarantee the ram they sell and would replace it. Every single store. Not suprisingly, the memory store that didn’t gaurantee their stuff is long long out of business and  in fact, they let their domain name expire and a very nice gentleman in Montreal now runs  a memory store  and yes, he will guarantee the memory he sells.</p>

<p>So if you do need 8G RAM – buy ram from a store you can trust and be happy knowing that your MacBook Pro will run just fine and if in the small chance there is a problem that the memory is guaranteed.</p>

<p>Good question and first we need to understand one thing about memory and MacBook Pro Memory before we go there research the best price you can get on ram for MacBook Pros. The fact is, that if you chart it over time MacBook Pro RAM gets cheaper and cheaper. It wasn’t too long ago that the only MacBook Pro was the new unibody 17 inch MacBook Pro and yes you could finally install  8GB of memory into a MacBook Pro but you would need a lot of money to do so, to the  tune of over a thousand dollars.</p>

<p>Now, unless you’re NASA or some goverment  agency  or some business that rakes in hundreds of thousands of dollars each day,  you do not need a whole lot of RAM. And one thousand dollars for RAM upgrades is just well, silly. But that’s just one guys opinion, it’s bad enough I spent over $2000 on a MacBook Pro – the last thing my budget needs is another thousand dollars to spend on RAM.</p>

<p><strong>Cheaper MacBook Pro Memory</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I"><img title="Cheapest MacBook Pro" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-4.36.30-PM.png" alt="Cheap 2011 MacBook Pro" width="508" height="353" /></a></p>

<p>Thankfully, like a lot of things in life – the longer you wait the cheaper it gets. Especially with technology. Just like there’s now $100 iPhones, and $300 netbook computers you will soon be able to buy cheaper RAM for MacBooks too. Look at the Apple iPod. It had a crappy black and white screen, was as big as a house and only held 1000 songs. There was no way to upgrade the memory on the Apple iPods so you had to wait. Wait until Apple released cheaper iPods that would offer more storage and brighters screens, and now you can find cheap MP3 players for about the same amount of change you’d find in your seat cushions.</p>

<p>All this to say:<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="apple ram"> Apple RAM</a> or any memory upgrade gets cheaper over time. The big question becomes:  can you wait that long? Can you wait until the ram prices drop so you can get the best deal possible on MacBook Pro RAM? That’s really the biggest question. What’s your time worth? If you spend more and more time waiting than you do working then a ram upgrade is worth the price whatever it costs. But if all you are using your  Apple MacBook Pro for is for surfing the internet and email your MacBook Pro probably came with enough RAM right out of  the box.</p>

<p>But you want to upgrade your memory on your Mac, and you just want to know what the price range of MacBook RAM is, for crying  out loud. OK, OK I have rambled on long enough. As I write this the best price you get on  <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_Pro_(1066_DDR3)-2gb/" title="2gb macbook pro ram">MacBook Pro 2GB RAM memory modules are about $50 each</a> and to upgrade to the larger <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_Pro_(1066_DDR3)-4gb/" title="macbook pro 4gb ram">4GB RAM for MacBooks</a>, you will have to shell out about &amp;$150 each.  Prices on RAM change so if you’re reading this in the future these ram prices might not be applicable.</p>

<p>RAM Prices for MacBook Pros sure have dropped. You can max out the RAM on your MacBook Pro for about $300 now.  A year ago it would have cost you double that for the very same ram.  In another post I’ll show you how to get the cheapest RAM prices for MacBook Pros and  it’s pretty easy to do if you’ve done some frugal ram shopping.</p>

Frankly, if you buy pretty much any  ram that’s specified for your MacBook Pro and the thing boots up  – you’re good.<strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I">Best MacBook Pro Price</a></strong></p>

<p>There was one time many many years ago when all memory wasn’t the same and a lot of stores will try to get you to believe their ram is the best ram in the entire world but when it comes down to buttons and  brass tacks, all ram is pretty much the same as long as it’s tested and built to you specific Apple MacBook Pro memory requirements.</p>

<p>**But what’s the difference in MacBook Pro RAM? **</p>

<p>Customer service in my opinion. Is it easy to order online? Is your credit card secure when you place your order for MacBook Pro memory?</p>

<p>How about knowledge of the products they sell? Some memory stores are more interested in the lowest memory prices, and make up for any losses in sheer volume. Other memory sellers would much prefer a higher end customer that places an order for hundreds of quality ram parts all at once and so they market to those customers and go after the big corporate and school memory sales. Schools, especially can’t afford to upgrade their Macs every year- especially in this sour economy and budget cuts so what they do is upgrade the ram for every computer in the school. That’s a pretty big memory order and can make or break a memory store’s bottom line.</p>

<p>But all you came here for was the best deal on the best RAM for your MacBook Pro. You love how the keyboard feels on your MacBook Pro, and how that 13 inch or 15 inch MacBook Screen is bright and all the free iApps that Apple included pretty much get every user  up and running with word processing, web browsing and email right out of the box. But now you just want to increase the MacBook Pro’s performance and get the best deal on  RAM as money is money, and the economy sucks and heck,  you might not even know if you’ll have a job next week so saving money on anything you buy, MacBook Cases, RAM or hard drive. All you know is you need RAM. Maybe you read a Mac Blog or the guy at the Apple Store told you you should upgrade your ram to get the most out of your MacBook Pro it doesn’t matter how you ended up sitting in front of your computer and  searching for the best value MacBook RAM,  you’re here and you want to know one thing and one thing only :</p>

<p>**What’s the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_Pro_KITS_(1066_DDR3)/" title="best ram for macbook pro">Best RAM for MacBook Pro</a>? **</p>

<p>I think you’ll find the best RAM for MacBook Pro  from a number of memory stores, and yes even Apple Store is you’re so inlined.. You’ll pay a bit more for it, and it’s a big pain booking an appointment at the Genius bar but at least you’ll be feeling the Apple vibe while you wait in line to get your MacBook fixed because the RAM doesn’t work.  Or, you could buy RAM form a list of Apple Memory stores that have been in business for over a decade and specialize  in nothing but RAM for your new or old MacBook Pro, and other macs too – iMacs, Mac Minis, Mac Pros, even those PC’s  you mac fans love to hate: Dell Memory, Toshiba RAM, Sony Memory – it doesn’t matter  as they are all very very reputable online memory stores that do nothing  but specialize in <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="apple memory upgrades">Memory Upgrades for Apple</a>.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2010/07/8gb-macbook-pro-ram-prices/">8GB MacBook Pro RAM Prices</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I">Cheapest MacBook Pro Deal</a></strong></p>

<p>Where to Buy 8GB of RAM? Well, that depends. If you want the lowest price you can find for Apple MacBook Memory you should scoot over  the the front page of ramseeker  and use my handy-dandy memory configurator  I’ve whipped up for you to useThe latest MacBook Models from Apple can now accept up to 8GB of ram which is quite a significant jump from the 4gb maximum of even a year or so ago. Why the increase of MacBook Pro memory 8GB. One factor that shouldn’t be overlooked is price. <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="ram prices drop">ram prices drop</a> over time and  at one point not too long ago you would have to pay a lot more money to get 8gb of RAM into any Apple Mac, not just the MacBooks and MacBook Pros. For a long time, the only Apple Computers that would accept more than 8GB of RAM were Mac Pro Models and even they maxed out at 32gb.</p>

<div>
</div>

<p>Let me explain a bit on how I categorize the Apple Memory into Groups. Long, long ago when I started I only had to worry about listing a few ram prices for popular Macs. This was back in the day of the PowerMac G3’s and  even 32mb would set you back a pretty penny. 1GB of ram would cost over $1000 and so it was pretty simple as I only had a few pages to keep track of all the memory  that I do here on ramseeker.</p>

<p>But then, Apple couldn’t leave well enough alone. Nope,  they had to come out with  new models all the time. First, the iBooks came out and then a bit later the MacBooks and MacBook Pros (an aside:  I never cared for my black macbook I used to have – it showed the fingerprints too easy). So I added more pages to <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="ramseeker">ramseeker</a>, and more and more memory stores and started a discontinued section for all the Apple Models that were, well – discontinued.</p>

<p>That’s all fine and dandy but then about  2003 or so, Apple changed the specifications on some of their Macs where you had to buy the memory in matched pairs –  0r memory upgrade kits – as I call them. And it seems as some memory stores started to list their memory upgrades for the Mac as memory upgrade kits and some other  – nope, they stuck to their guns and still listed all their memory upgrades as individual modules.</p>

<p>That’s fine, but how can I differentiate? I can’t list both memory kits for the MacBook Pro  and Memory Modules for the MacBook Pros on the same page as that wouldn’t be fair. When you go to sort by price when comparing ram prices the module prices would always show first, and then the memory upgrade KITs would come next, and that’s no good. So what I did was make two pages. One for MacBook Pro – single  module and another page for MacBook Pro KIT, including the 8GB Memory Kits that are such a good deal these days.</p>

<p>But it’s still a bit confusing when shopping for 8GB MacBook Kits as the older MacBook Pros accepted PC5300 DR2 SO -DIMMS but the newer MacBook Pro Models took the DDR3 1066 MHZ so there’s that to differntiate from too when MacBook Pro Memory Shopping.</p>

<p>But  here’ what you need. You need MacBook Pro DDR3 1066 ram prices, and check both the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_Pro_KITS_(1066_DDR3)/" title="Apple MacBook Pro Memory Kits">MacBook Pro Memory upgrade kits </a>and the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_Pro_(1066_DDR3)/" title="macbook pro memory modules">MacBook Pro memory modules</a> to0,as you never know who has the best deal on ram, and you shouldn’t discount the guys who choose to sell their ram individually instead of a package deal</p>

<p>Do your homework and  you’ll get the best deal you can on 8GB MacBook Pro RAM Prices.</p>

<p>When you are in need of memory for computer – and this applies to all types of computers regardess of  computer maker or model – there are a few things to consider before you call your local computer shop, buy memory online or start to search eBay for your computer memory needs.</p>

<p><a href="&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1375" title="Best Apple Computer Memory" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-8.22.30-PM.png" alt="Cheap Computer RAM" width="542" height="285" /></a></p>

<p><strong><a href="&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW">Cheap Computer Memory</a></strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Price</strong>. Is the computer memory you are interested in for you particular computer priced competitively? You’re going to get a much better deal on your computer memory if you buy it from a third party memory store that specializes in memory for Apple for an example than if you buy the memory from Apple directly (although in recent times Apple memory from the Apple Store is getting more competitive)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Compatibility</strong>. Will the memory you want work in your computer without issue? Have all the manufacturer’s memory specifications been met so that when you go to install the memory you will be sure that the computer memory you bought works with your computer. Memory is fragile and susceptible to  damage from static electricity.  Installing bad ram could mean your computer does not run smoothly or even not at all after you installed bad ram.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Customer service</strong>. If your main objective is number 1 above, price, you may have to be wiling to be sacrifice customer service for price. Are you willing to make that sacrifice. Personally  I am not and  would much rather buy my ram from a memory store I know and trust. Better yet if the store specializes in nothing but memory.  If you make your living with your computer, ask yourself how much your time is worth. Do you have th time and patience  and are willing to sacrifice the potential of lost income, just because your memory failed due to the fact that you bought cheap ram from a questionable price.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The good news is you can buy ram with confidence and get numbers 1,2 and 3 when you buy the memory from one of the vendors I recommend. all and any of the memory stores you see on ramseeker have been in the comptuter memory business for over a decade and do nothing all day but to sell you the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="best memory best prices">best memory upgrades at the best price</a>.</p>

<p>Whatever your memory ugpgrade needs might be, you owe it to yourself to get the best deal on the beset ram at the best price with the least amount of time and aggravation.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2010/07/how-to-buy-the-best-cheap-desktop-ram/">How To Buy the Best Cheap Desktop Ram</a></h1>

<div style="float: right; margin-right: 5px;">
</div>

<div style="float: right; margin-right: 5px;">
</div>

<p>Despite the fact that notebook computers seem to be outpacing the sales of desktop computers, there’s lots of times when buying a cheap desktop computer is a better deal than buying a cheap netbook, or laptop computer.</p>

<p>A desktop computer does indeed usually lack a handle to make it truly portable, but for the most part the desktop rises head and shoulders above the desktop computer for one reason that stands out in my mind and that’s expadability. The desktop computer usually has lots of room for <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="memory for desktops">memory upgrades</a>.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013FK9U2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0013FK9U2"><img title="Best Selling Apple Desktop" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-8.18.44-PM.png" alt="Cheap Desktop Computers" width="475" height="228" /></a></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013FK9U2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0013FK9U2">Apple Mac Mini. Best Selling Desktop Computer</a></strong></p>

<p>Desktop RAM is priced usually pretty much the same as notebook memory but the benefit of buying ram for your desktop is you can buy more ram  which in turn means more performance out of your desktop computer. Now if  all you use is a word processing document you don’t need to worry about speed as much as the computer is going to  be waiting on you to type. There’s a good chance that if all you use to compute is to do light email and web surfing and some data entry you don’t have to worry too much about computer speed. The computer, either desktop  or notebook will be waiting for you to finish typing. In the meantime, it just waits.</p>

<p>But, if you are a graphic designer, or  use  photo imaging tools such as photoshop or lightroom you’re going to need all the ram you can get your hands on, or at very least – all the memory you can afford to buy. Hard drives too but that’s another post all in itself.</p>

<p>You have your desktop computer and it’s too slow. You need to buy more ram. How much RAM you can add to your desktop will depend usually on the motherboard and how many memory upgrade slots are available. Can you install the memory in pairs?  Can you keep the the memory you have in the computer already, or will you need  to upgrade all your memory and replace the RAM you have? All these are good questions to ask and consider before you go looking to buy cheap ram for your desktop.</p>

<p>The good news is every memory store offers what is called as a memory configurator. It’s a pretty fancy term but all it does is help you find the the best ram you need at the best price. You usually enter  your computer brand,  or sometimes your motherboard type if the PC you want to upgrade is hand built by you or a custom PC store. The next thing the configurator does is ask you about the model of your computer</p>

<p>To find the model of your computer can sometimes be a bit tricky but it’s usually written on the back of your desktop computer or sometimes on the bottom if you have a notebook or  laptop. Once you have brand and model name of your computer a customized page on the memory store’s website is returned to you exlaining all you need to know about memory upgrade choices for your computer. Size of ram you need to get to the ram upgrade you want and whether you need to upgrade the memory in pairs, or if you can get away with just buying one memory module at a time.</p>

<p>Somes stores even offer different choices in quality: You can chose to buy more expensive but with higher quality parts – name brand memory. Or if your budget is tight and you just want to buy the cheapest ram you can find then they offer that too.</p>

<p>Buying cheap ram whether in desktop form or a notebook is not hard and you’ll get the best price on ram if you compare prices on ram  from a selection of stores as all memory stores offer different prices for their desktop memory. Take your time, find your desktop computer brand and model name and find a memory store you can trust and use their memory configurator to get the beat deal on desktop ram..</p>

<p>The answer to your question: what’s the most ram I can put into a macbook? is 4GB of RAM  can go into an Apple MacBook, if it’s the most recent model of Apple MacBook, or even a pretty recent model you can install 4GB of  RAM into the two slots. To do this, you will need to buy macbook ram in pairs, or single memory modules. There’s no real difference between the pairs and the  individual memory modules except for the fact that some stores sell macbook memory in kits, as opposed to individual pieces of ram.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002C7489S/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002C7489S"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1378" title="Cheap Apple MacBook" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-8.25.19-PM.png" alt="Best Price Apple MacBook" width="573" height="312" /></a></p>

<p>With the Macbooks, there are 2 different ram types you should consider: PC2 5300 DDR so-dimms were the first ram modules made available for macbook laptop computers, but as apple kept on releasing newer and newer macbooks they changed the memory requirements to DDR3 ram which runs at 1066MHz and that is the memory type that all newer macbooks require.</p>

<p>There’s a good chance your macbook came from the factory shipped with  just 2GB of memory installed wit 1x2gb in each available memory upgrade slot, so to upgrade to 4gb you will need to buy 2 2gb ram modules to buy ram for your macbook computer</p>

<p>If your macbook is new and released in 2010: 4GB</p>

<p>If you have an older macbook you want to upgrade, then chances are it’s maxed out already at 2GB  but be sure to check your model and then ask one of my recommended<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="where to buy memory"> memory stores t</a>o ask and double check your macbook memory requirements.</p>

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>Probably two of the hottest selling electronics right now have to be Mac Laptops otherwise known as MacBook and MacBook Pro and digital cameras. And the best part, is that without the one, you can’t use the other. A digital camera is pretty much useless if you cannot transfer your photos to your Mac Laptop and then share the with the world, or at very least your friends and family. And when you buy a mac laptop you are equipped with Apple’s software suite right out of the box and that includes iPhoto which offers a fast and easy way to organize, edit and share your photos.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I">MacBook Pro: Best Selling Apple Laptop</a></strong></p>

<p>**Where to Buy a Mac Laptop and Digital Camera. **</p>

<p>If you buy your Macbook from the Apple Store, you can save money but only on the refurbished Macbooks.  And these are fine and and easy way  to save some money, but for this article I am going to assume you want to buy a new mac laptop. Maybe you are starting school soon and you need to buy a new mac laptop  to take with you when you go away to school. I have searched high and low and I found the easiest way to save money on a Mac Laptop and a digital camera is to buy the two together at Amazon.</p>

<p>The reason for this is that when you do this you will get a deal on both and in some cases you can add accessories to both and save even more money on the macbook or macbook pro. One Apple notebook bundle you might want to consider is one that includes a case, and an extra charger and maybe some special cleaner for the display, or how about an extra charger? You can get  a pretty great deal on Apple bundles.</p>

<p>Right now, when you buy a new macbook you can get a free iPod too. This is only a back to school offer so if you’re interested in doing this I would buy your macbook soooner than later</p>

<p>For the digital cameras, there are many choices and I have written enough  for now, but you apply the same logic when buying a digital camer too. Find the discount digital camera you want and start adding accessories such as extra lenses. There are many ways to expand your digital camera with cases and digital camera memory too, so it’s best to bundle.</p>

<p>When you wan to get a deal on a Mac Laptop and Digital Camera, do your homework when making your choices and when you are ready to buy a macbook or buy a digital camera you will happy with the choices you have made.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: I orginally wrote this is 2010, and now that <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/2011-apple-macbook-pros-announced/" title="2011 Apple MacBook Pros Announced">2011 MacBook Pros</a> are readily available  I  thought it might be wise to update the <strong>MacBook Pro memory chart</strong> below to include <strong>2011 Apple MacBook Pro Memory Prices</strong> as well.<br />
[table id=15 /]</p>

<p>The ram below is for the <strong>February 2011 Apple MacBook Pro models</strong> and can accept up to 8GB of RAM, according to Apple and 16Gb if you ask a few other memory stores. I don’t recommend you install more than 8GB of memory as this is the maximum MacBook Pro memory specification as indicated by Apple.</p>

<p>[table id=7/]</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The Best Memory for MacBook Pro 2010 really just needs to be cheap, good and meet  apple’s standards for memory upgrades.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1380" title="Apple MacBook Pro" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-8.27.38-PM.png" alt="Best Selling Apple Laptop" width="517" height="321" /></a></p>

<p>That’s  it.</p>

<p>What  I can tell you is that the MacBook Pro’s for 2010 have two slots and with the spring 2010 refresh, all the MacBook Pros can now accept up to 8 GB of  RAM.</p>

<p>You’ll need to buy DDR3 1066 SDRAM so-dimms and I suggest visiting one of the memory stores I already track prices for as these guys both know their stuff and have macbook memory in stock and ready to ship. If you want, you can pay a bit more and buy crucial memory and you’re paying for the brand name and all those full color glossy ads in the magazines. But they offer a a good product at  a pretty competetive price.</p>

<p>they are not the cheapest around for MacBook Pro RAM so if every penny and dollar counts, check for prices on MacBook Memory and find the beat deal on ram for the MacBook Pro’s that you can and go with it. The RAM for the MacBook Pros is  easy to install. I found the bottom of the macbook case to be a bit fiddly to get off but once I had it’s just a matter of slipping out the old ram and installing two four gig macbook ram chips if you’re looking to upgrade to the full 8GB on the MacBook Pros.</p>

<p>Can you get away with 4GB?  Sure and if you’re doing most emailing and web browsing you’ll be fine. But it is my opinion you should max out the macbook pro memory. You have  paid apple for pro features anyway so you might as well dip into your pockets just a bit more and get the most ram you can possibly install with a MacBook Pro. Ram for the MacBook Pros is pretty cheap these days and you’ll never have enough ram.</p>

<p>But there really is no Best Memory for MacBook Pro’s. Buy from a company that specializes in Apple RAM and you’ll do fine.</p>

<p>In fact, the cost is so low these days, that ram prices and comparing ram prices over time you will find that the price to add ram to macbook is so very cheap that it doesn’t make sense not to add ram to your macbook, or macbook pro or any other portable apple computer you have or thinking of  buying.</p>

<p>When you buy a MacBook or MacBook Pro from Apple, or Amazon, or MacMall, or wherever else you want to buy an apple computer from you should always upgrade your macbook or macbook pro ram and memory to the maximum amout of memory  you possibly can, or in some cases, afford to.</p>

<p>If you can afford to upgrade your memory, why not do it in a way that makes sense? Don’t buy the first memory upgrade you see. Yes, you might be able to buy memory from your macbook pro or macbook right from  apple, but when you buy memory from apple, the ram is very expensive and you can buy cheaper ram from other  online memory stores for much less money than what you would spend if you bought the same memory from anywhere else, including the Apple Store.</p>

<p>If you need to<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="buy ram apple computer"> buy ram for any apple computer</a>, I suggest go check ram prices as they change daily sometimes. The good news is ram prices have dropped over time and you can still get some really good deals on ram for less than what you would pay if you bought your memory from the Apple Store, or Costco, or even Walmart. And do you really want to buy your memory  from Apple? Apple is interested in one thing and that’s profit. Don’t let the apple koolaid get to you –  they are in business to make as much money as possible and will continue to do so over the years.</p>

<p>But  if you buy ram from some memory stores that specialize in Apple Memory and yet still  allow you  to get the best price you can on memory upgrades that meet Apple’s high standards.</p>

<p>It doesn’t cost much to upgrade the MacBook or MacBook Pro’s with the most RAM possible. You will be glad you did upgrade your computer as your computer will run faster  and will crash, well never. It’s a Mac. Fill it with memory and forget about what the costs of ram upgrades are until you are ready to buy memory again.</p>

<p>You’re here at this page because you want to do one thing: Buy Apple RAM Memory for Cheap.</p>

<p>But this does not mean that you dear reader, are cheap. No no no, this just means that you want to buy memory at the best price you can from a reputable store that offers free shipping, hassle free warranty and knows Apple Memory and RAM inside and out. With new Apple Models comign out from Apple all the time you know that after spending all that money on a new Mac computer, it only makes sense to buy memory from memory stores that support you and also the mac community.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW"><img title="Cheap Apple Memory" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-8.33.14-PM.png" alt="Best Priced Apple RAM" width="525" height="282" /></a></strong></p>

<div>
</div>

<p>Sure, you could buy ram from some generic computer store but these guys are just moving boxes for the most part. They have no idea about the individual apple computer or what memory your mac takes, and there’s a real good chance they don’t even care. This is why you want to buy apple ram from apple authorized memory stores that support the  Apple community, because believe it or not, we’re all in this together. yes, that means you with the apple logo shaved into the back of your head.</p>

<p>And this is why I only  list the best memory for Apple from the best stores for Apple Memory: The ones that specialize in Apple Memory and not much else. Vendors like Crucial,  OWC, MemoryX, 1-800-4-Memory , RAMJET  just to name a few. We’re  talking years and years of  experience of making memory (yes, that’s right, they actually make the ram to precise apple specifications) just for your new or old Mac so that it will run the fastest it possibly can but without any startup issues or crashes due to buying bad ram.</p>

<p>If you’re looking for Cheap RAM, stop.  Pay a few dollars more (we’re talking less than a coffee at starbucks here for most memory stores)  and  buy ram that’s not cheap, but is good. In fact, it’s great.</p>

<p>I know my time is important to me, so that’s why when I upgrade my apple computer,  I **buy the best ram at the best price **I can find  from a memory store I can trust and then, I’m done.</p>

<p>When shopping for ram or memory upgrades for the Apple MacBooks that released earlier this year in 2010 you don’t need to really worry about what the fastest ram is. Speed, really isn’t the issue here. Yes, it has to be DDR3 1066 SDRAM but there’s no fast ram or slow ram for the new Apple Macbooks.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1388" title="Cheapest Appel MacBook Pro" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-8.36.11-PM.png" alt="Best Price on new macbook pro" width="525" height="299" /></a><br />

<p>In fact, there’s no Apple RAM, as long as the memory is certified to be compatible with Apple, you’re good.</p>

<p>I’d be much more concerned about two things when shopping for Apple MacBook Pro RAM:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Price.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Customer  Service.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Some days, you’ll luck out and get the best  of both worlds, and  if you do buy from any of the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="apple memory store">Apple Memory Stores </a>I list you’ll do just fine in both regards. Every memory store I list has been with me for way longer than the MacBook Pro has been around, so you’re sure to get good customer service and a fair price from any vendor.</p>

<p>That said, don’t be surprised that like all things in life, you get what you pay for and the lowest price might not be the best deal sometimes. (Not always but it happens)</p>

<p>The memory stores that always offer the lowest prices on RAM do so because  they’re hoping for volume. If they sell 100 orders a day and make a dollar each, they’ve profited $100. But  they have to deal with 100 different  customers. Customers that are more concerned about price than service a lot of times and don’t care that the memory takes longer to ship, or that the store’s lifetime warranty might not be up to snuff. He’s a busy man – he’s got 100 cheap customers to ship ram to today.</p>

<p>In contrast let’s take the memory vendor that offers ram for a few dollars more. Because he’s making ten dollars on each sale, he (or she) makes only ten sales to reach  that hundred dollars. This store is happy to to make less, but not have to deal with the more price concious consumers. Because vendor B only has ten orders to ship, they’re more than willing to help you troubleshoot, answer pre-order questions or hold your hand along the way and offers support if you need it.</p>

<p>I list both at ramseeker and always have – and have never promoted the lowest price. I allow you to chose  which is more important to you: low price or better service</p>

<p>Again you lucked out, and I don’t list any stores that don’t specialize in memory upgrades and have watched more than one low price leader go the way of the dodo bird over the years.</p>

<p>So when I get questions on what is the fastest ram or what is the best ram, I always say: Pick the price and store that you like and order ram from any of the memory stores I list and you will be happy with your memory purchase.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2010/04/what-does-upgrading-imac-memory-cost/">What does upgrading iMac Memory Cost?</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>[table id=2 /]</p>

<p>The prices, or costs for the different Apple iMac Models and memory upgrades over the years have changed as new technology has been introduced, which results in new Apple Mac Memory being needed depending on what model of iMac you plan to upgrade with more memory.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8IO6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8IO6">Cheapest Apple iMacs</a></strong></p>

<p>The latest iMacs released in 2008 and 2009 require the use of DDR3 1066 SDRAM so-dimms, and depending on the particular iMac you have you can upgrade to either 4gb or 8gb of ram for the newer, modern iMacs.  About a year ago when the newest iMac models at the time were released – 8gb of ram for the iMacs would cost as much as the computer itself. 8GB memory kits, especially when you bought them from the Apple Store directly were prohibitively expensive at prices hovering around the $1000 mark for an 8GB iMac ram upgrade kit.</p>

<p><strong>iMac Prices Have Dropped</strong></p>

<p>Thanks to more demand of the 8GB memory kits  the prices have dropped considerably when you want to buy two 4 gig memory modules and install them in your new Apple iMac. Now (spring 2010), <strong>the cost to max out your iMac and fill it with ram is a much more reasonable cost of about $350-400.</strong></p>

<p>The 4GB memory upgrades from Apple have even dropped recently, so though it still costs more to upgrade your iMac when you<a href="http://www.apple.com" title="apple ram"> buy ram directly from Apple</a>, it’s a possibility now as the prices, while still more than if you bought the ram from a third party memory shop, is priced more reasonably than before. But you’ll still pay about a $100-200 price for the Apple RAM over the same ram when bought elsewhere.</p>

<p>The 4GB RAM and memory modules (1066 DDR3)  are still pricier than their smaller sized memory chips. If you can get away with it, you might be able to <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/iMac_KITS_(DDR3_1066)/" title="save money on imac ram">save</a></strong> <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/iMac_KITS_(DDR3_1066)/" title="save money on imac ram">some money on iMac ram</a></strong> by not maxing out your current Apple iMac and just upgrading to 4GB with 2×2 memory modules as the 2GB ram is still priced much lower than the 4gb module. It would make sense that if a 2gb module costs $1, than a 4GB memory upgrade would be priced at $2, but not so. At time of writing this, 2GB RAM for iMacs costs about $44.00, while the 4GB RAM for Apple iMacs cost 4x as much with street prices being in the $175-200 range from most stores.</p>

<p>It really is up to you to decide what the best ram upgrade option is for your iMac. If you can afford to, and justify <strong>the cost an 8GB iMac upgrade makes the most sense</strong> as you will get the fastest speed from your iMac. But if money is a factor, you should work  with the 4GB upgrade kit. <strong>4gb of RAM is more than enough memory</strong> for the tasks suited to the iMac, such as web browsing, email  and using the iLife software that came with your Apple iMac.</p>

<p>If you need any help with <strong>RAM upgrades for your iMac,</strong> I’m more than happy to help.</p>

		<div class="post-content"><p><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="imac ram">iMac RAM</a>, or iMac Memory if you prefer, comes in many different memory configurations and specifications over the years as Apple has elected to keep the iMac monitor regardless of processor or even design changes, as soon as the last model is replaced with a new model, the new model is called iMac and is the older iMac model. As far as apple is concerned, an iMac is whatever th e most current version of the iMac Family.</p>

<p>[table id=2 /]</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8IO6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8IO6">Cheap Apple iMac Prices</a></strong></p>

<p>**iMac Names **</p>

<p>Sometimes to avoid confusion, Apple will add a description to their iMacs such as iMac Intel i5 processor, or iMac G5 , or even iMac 27 inch. Some way to differentiate between the many iMac models. But for the most part, and especially when marketing Apple’s consumer based all in one desktop computer. Then it’s just iMac. But when you’re shopping for an iMac from even the apple store or amazon or looking up info in the apple knowledgebase the iMac model is usually specified by some name other than just iMac.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/iMac_(DDR3_1066)/" title="iMac Memory">iMac Memory </a></strong></p>

<p>When it comes down to iMac Memory, and when there was only the first iMac available, things were pretty easy  –  I created a page specifically for iMac RAM, and didnt’ do much planning for future iMacs to be honest. And then Apple went and released the slot loading iMac and now I had to differentiate between the two iMac models as they now take different memory. But, as there was only two different iMac models at the time I still, just made another page and called it iMac 350 to 500, or something along those lines.</p>

<p>Apple went  and really put the kinks into my plans when they released the iMac Flat Panel models as then I had to not only track the lowest price, but there was two different types of RAM – one slot was user accessible yet the other slot you had to take your iMac into an apple certified repair center to get the other ram slot upgraded (what a stupid system, eh?). But still, there’s only 3 iMacs so I just made a new page to track the new ram that these new iMacs came with (pc133 sodimms) and i created a page called PC133. The Flat Panel iMacs release is when I had to rethink for future iMacs as I realized that this was the future, and apple would once release new computers that were new iMacs and completely different than their predecessors, yet would be named just iMac.</p>

<p>With the release of the new Flat Panel iMacs that took PC2100 DDR sdram sodimms, I would just name the model and then (usually in brackets) I would put the memory type to differentiate the different iMac models.</p>

<p>I continue with this naming strategy, up to and including the iMacs with Intel i5 processors as these models take DDR3 1066 SDRAM  so the pages are named in the format of: Model Name (Memory Type) for the current and all iMac models.</p>

<p>The only downside for this system is that you have to know what memory type you need to take full advantage. I have tried to make things easier for you by separating the pull down menu so that I list current apple models first, and then list the older discontinued models.</p>

<p>If you need any help with iMac RAM you can feel free to contact me and I will be glad to help you get the right memory for your iMac at the best price.</p>

<p>I have specialized in Apple Memory for over 13 years and have tracked memory prices for each and every mac made since about 1997, starting with the Beige PowerMac G3 desktops and working all the way through iBooks, iMacs and PowerBook and MacBook Pro RAM.</p>

<p>So today I thought I’d start with a little primer on the what apple ram you need for your mac computer. Now I realize that there’s very little demand for older mac memory as its’ been my personal experience to upgrade my computer when I buy it to the fullest capacity over the years and then just forget about it. But if you’ve got an older Mac Computer you want to upgrades – maybe it’s a hand me down, or a hobby project, or maybe you just need a cheap computer for some word processing tasks, then older macs are still a very viable solution. You don’t need to spend thousands of dollars on a new MacBook Pro if all you’re doing is some email and web work. A used Macbook would do you quite nicely. But regardless of the model of older mac computer you end up buying you can still get a good deal more use out of it if you buy some more memory. Especially on the older Macs – adding more ram or adding a bigger hard drive can mean a world of difference in performance.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/Power_Mac_G3_(Beige)/" title="Beige Desktop G3 RAM">Beige Desktop G3 RAM</a></strong></p>

<p>The memory on the beige G3’s can run 256mb memory modules and you can still buy 256mb ram for beige G3’s for just $15. The memory you need for this computer is PC100 SDRAM</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/Power_Mac_G3_(Blue_White)/">Blue and white PowerMac G3</a></strong></p>

<p>It seems just like yesterday that these were released with their cool  iMac inspired color schemes and cool handles to carry them and the nifty way the entire side of the computer swings out for easy ram upgrades. These will accept 256mb memory upgrades that cost as little as $15 these days.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/Power_Mac_G4_(PC100)/" title="powermac g4 memory">PowerMac G4 PC100</a></strong></p>

<p>These  PowerMac  G4’s used pretty much the same case as the Blue and White PowerMac G3’s but that’s where the difference ended for these computers. PC100 SDRAM is used in these models, regardless whether you had the ‘yikes’ version or the AGP video card version. These accepted 512mb  which is now priced at $23 and up.</p>

<p>These 3 desktop  computers from Apple are just a few of the older mac computers I still track and monitor memory prices for. Even though these discontinued Macs are deemed obsolete by today’s standards, if you fill them with RAM and upgrade the hard drives they can still be considered great little computers for email or word processing.</p>

<p>PC memory has really dropped in prices over the last few years. Ten years ago, 1GB of <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/pc/" title="ram for pc">RAM for a PC </a>would have cost over two thousand dollars when it was first released.  It has been my experiences that the price of ram just keeps getting cheaper and cheaper until demand for the memory starts to dwindle due to new technologies being released over time and  the older ram usally rises in price a small percentage as the demand drops.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013FK9U2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0013FK9U2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1372" title="Best Selling Apple Desktop" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-8.18.44-PM.png" alt="Cheap Desktop Computers" width="475" height="228" /></a></p>

<p><strong>It doesn’t matter what ram costs</strong></p>

<p>[table id=7 /]</p>

<div>
</div>

<p>Regardless of whether you are buying a PC  or Apple computer, or perhaps you’re creating a new PC from scratch  and you need ram it is always best to buy the most ram  you can afford as the benefits far outweigh the costs.</p>

<p>For example 8GB 1066 DDR3 memory (also known as DDR3 PC8500) is priced still pretty expensively. Not as much as a year ago, where it would cost you over a thousand dollars for this memory configuration, but enough still today that 8G of DDR3 will cost in the $400 to $500 price range.</p>

<p>If you can do with smaller amounts of ram, 1GB of  DDR3 ram for PC’s  costs under $20. The ram prices for 1GB have risen in recent months down from a low of $11.00 for 1GB  of RAM. If you need more than 1GB of memory, the 2GB RAM for most desktop and laptop PC computers costs just $40 or so, which is another bargain. If you’ve been paying attention this works out to double what the 1GB RAM costs so you will still be getting a bargain.</p>

<p>It’s only when you get into either exotic memory types (such as RAMBUS or RDRAM) or larger sizes, where the technology and demand haven’t met up yet for the sweet spot of memory upgrade and low price – is where you’ll get bitten for a high ram price.</p>

<p>The 2Gb memory size at the time being seems to be the best size of memory module for your PC computer – it doesn’t matter  – desktop or notebook computers. On notebook computers you are usually physically limited  due to size and also heat  on how much ram you can install in a netbook or notebook computer. On a desktop computer your ram upgrade options are usually much more as you have more ram slots to install memory into and so on most PC’s you can use cheap ram with small sizes to save money on ram upgrades.</p>

<p>Your PC manufacturer will be able  to help you with how much RAM you can install and what type of ram you need, but when yo have this information at your arsenal you can upgrade the memory to the maximum.<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="ram is cheap"> RAM is cheap</a>. Max out the ram on your PC and you can enjoy years of trouble free computing.</p>

<p>It has been my policy  to always monitor <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="apple memory">apple memory</a></strong> prices that are generic, as my thinking is this:  Generic is the best memory you can buy if you want to save money on ram, be it for apple, dell, hp or sony computers.

<p><strong>The Difference Between Generic and Brand Name Memory Upgrades</strong></p>

<p>First off, there’s the price. Generic memory is cheaper, no doubt and it’s made and manufactured to the same standards as the name brand ram but there’s no fancy logo on the generic ram, it’s made and assembled with parts that are, well, generic.</p>

<p>Brand name on the  hand is supplied by brand name manufacturers such as crucial technology, samsung, or micron (which manufactures memory for crucial technolog. With brand name, you’re paying for an established memory brand as opposed to a memory store that sticks their sticker on generic ram.</p>

<p>The difference is small, but the brand name ram might be a better option if your life depends on your memory working  100 percent all the time and any downtime would cost you a substantial amount of money. This isn’t  to say the generic memory isn’t’ good and reliable, and if you buy it from the memory stores I recommend such as <a href="http://www.ramjet.com" title="ramjet memory">RAMJET</a>, <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">Crucial</a>,  or <a href="http://18004memory.com" title="18004memory">18004memory</a> to name few memory stores, they back up the ram with their warranty and all these stores have been in business for over ten years at very least, some are closer to 20 years experience. They wouldn’t be in business that long if they sold bad ram.</p>

<p>The <strong>best memory for Apple</strong> is what you can afford and value. If you appreciate the brand name memory, then buy the name brand ram. If you think ram is ram is ram, then save money on ram and buy the generic ram.</p>

<p>Which ever <strong>method</strong> you choose when deciding what is the best memory for your mac, do yourself a favor and upgrade your apple computer to the maximum ram that your machine can allow as that will boost your performance of the computer you spent a lot of money on. Don’t be cheap on ram. Buy as much as you can afford, and your apple computer will accomodate. This one upgrade will offer you the most benefit when it comes to having a reliable computer that runs without any hiccups or service requirements.</p>
