<p>The answer to your question: what’s the most ram I can put into a macbook? is 4GB of RAM  can go into an Apple MacBook, if it’s the most recent model of Apple MacBook, or even a pretty recent model you can install 4GB of  RAM into the two slots. To do this, you will need to buy macbook ram in pairs, or single memory modules. There’s no real difference between the pairs and the  individual memory modules except for the fact that some stores sell macbook memory in kits, as opposed to individual pieces of ram.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002C7489S/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002C7489S"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1378" title="Cheap Apple MacBook" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-8.25.19-PM.png" alt="Best Price Apple MacBook" width="573" height="312" /></a></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002C7489S/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002C7489S">Cheapest Apple MacBook</a></strong></p>

<p>With the Macbooks, there are 2 different ram types you should consider: PC2 5300 DDR so-dimms were the first ram modules made available for macbook laptop computers, but as apple kept on releasing newer and newer macbooks they changed the memory requirements to DDR3 ram which runs at 1066MHz and that is the memory type that all newer macbooks require.</p>

<p>There’s a good chance your macbook came from the factory shipped with  just 2GB of memory installed wit 1x2gb in each available memory upgrade slot, so to upgrade to 4gb you will need to buy 2 2gb ram modules to buy ram for your macbook computer</p>

<p>If your macbook is new and released in 2010: 4GB</p>

<p>If you have an older macbook you want to upgrade, then chances are it’s maxed out already at 2GB  but be sure to check your model and then ask one of my recommended<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="where to buy memory"> memory stores t</a>o ask and double check your macbook memory requirements.</p>

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>Probably two of the hottest selling electronics right now have to be Mac Laptops otherwise known as MacBook and MacBook Pro and digital cameras. And the best part, is that without the one, you can’t use the other. A digital camera is pretty much useless if you cannot transfer your photos to your Mac Laptop and then share the with the world, or at very least your friends and family. And when you buy a mac laptop you are equipped with Apple’s software suite right out of the box and that includes iPhoto which offers a fast and easy way to organize, edit and share your photos.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I">MacBook Pro: Best Selling Apple Laptop</a></strong></p>

<p>**Where to Buy a Mac Laptop and Digital Camera. **</p>

<p>If you buy your Macbook from the Apple Store, you can save money but only on the refurbished Macbooks.  And these are fine and and easy way  to save some money, but for this article I am going to assume you want to buy a new mac laptop. Maybe you are starting school soon and you need to buy a new mac laptop  to take with you when you go away to school. I have searched high and low and I found the easiest way to save money on a Mac Laptop and a digital camera is to buy the two together at Amazon.</p>

<p>The reason for this is that when you do this you will get a deal on both and in some cases you can add accessories to both and save even more money on the macbook or macbook pro. One Apple notebook bundle you might want to consider is one that includes a case, and an extra charger and maybe some special cleaner for the display, or how about an extra charger? You can get  a pretty great deal on Apple bundles.</p>

<p>Right now, when you buy a new macbook you can get a free iPod too. This is only a back to school offer so if you’re interested in doing this I would buy your macbook soooner than later</p>

<p>For the digital cameras, there are many choices and I have written enough  for now, but you apply the same logic when buying a digital camer too. Find the discount digital camera you want and start adding accessories such as extra lenses. There are many ways to expand your digital camera with cases and digital camera memory too, so it’s best to bundle.</p>

<p>When you wan to get a deal on a Mac Laptop and Digital Camera, do your homework when making your choices and when you are ready to buy a macbook or buy a digital camera you will happy with the choices you have made.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: I orginally wrote this is 2010, and now that <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/2011-apple-macbook-pros-announced/" title="2011 Apple MacBook Pros Announced">2011 MacBook Pros</a> are readily available  I  thought it might be wise to update the <strong>MacBook Pro memory chart</strong> below to include <strong>2011 Apple MacBook Pro Memory Prices</strong> as well.<br />
[table id=15 /]</p>

<p>The ram below is for the <strong>February 2011 Apple MacBook Pro models</strong> and can accept up to 8GB of RAM, according to Apple and 16Gb if you ask a few other memory stores. I don’t recommend you install more than 8GB of memory as this is the maximum MacBook Pro memory specification as indicated by Apple.</p>

<p>[table id=7/]</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The Best Memory for MacBook Pro 2010 really just needs to be cheap, good and meet  apple’s standards for memory upgrades.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1380" title="Apple MacBook Pro" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-8.27.38-PM.png" alt="Best Selling Apple Laptop" width="517" height="321" /></a></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I">Cheapest Apple MacBook Pro</a></strong></p>

<p>That’s  it.</p>

<p>What  I can tell you is that the MacBook Pro’s for 2010 have two slots and with the spring 2010 refresh, all the MacBook Pros can now accept up to 8 GB of  RAM.</p>

<p>You’ll need to buy DDR3 1066 SDRAM so-dimms and I suggest visiting one of the memory stores I already track prices for as these guys both know their stuff and have macbook memory in stock and ready to ship. If you want, you can pay a bit more and buy crucial memory and you’re paying for the brand name and all those full color glossy ads in the magazines. But they offer a a good product at  a pretty competetive price.</p>

<p>they are not the cheapest around for MacBook Pro RAM so if every penny and dollar counts, check for prices on MacBook Memory and find the beat deal on ram for the MacBook Pro’s that you can and go with it. The RAM for the MacBook Pros is  easy to install. I found the bottom of the macbook case to be a bit fiddly to get off but once I had it’s just a matter of slipping out the old ram and installing two four gig macbook ram chips if you’re looking to upgrade to the full 8GB on the MacBook Pros.</p>

<p>Can you get away with 4GB?  Sure and if you’re doing most emailing and web browsing you’ll be fine. But it is my opinion you should max out the macbook pro memory. You have  paid apple for pro features anyway so you might as well dip into your pockets just a bit more and get the most ram you can possibly install with a MacBook Pro. Ram for the MacBook Pros is pretty cheap these days and you’ll never have enough ram.</p>

<p>But there really is no Best Memory for MacBook Pro’s. Buy from a company that specializes in Apple RAM and you’ll do fine.</p>

<p>In fact, the cost is so low these days, that ram prices and comparing ram prices over time you will find that the price to add ram to macbook is so very cheap that it doesn’t make sense not to add ram to your macbook, or macbook pro or any other portable apple computer you have or thinking of  buying.</p>

<p>When you buy a MacBook or MacBook Pro from Apple, or Amazon, or MacMall, or wherever else you want to buy an apple computer from you should always upgrade your macbook or macbook pro ram and memory to the maximum amout of memory  you possibly can, or in some cases, afford to.</p>

<p>If you can afford to upgrade your memory, why not do it in a way that makes sense? Don’t buy the first memory upgrade you see. Yes, you might be able to buy memory from your macbook pro or macbook right from  apple, but when you buy memory from apple, the ram is very expensive and you can buy cheaper ram from other  online memory stores for much less money than what you would spend if you bought the same memory from anywhere else, including the Apple Store.</p>

<p>If you need to<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="buy ram apple computer"> buy ram for any apple computer</a>, I suggest go check ram prices as they change daily sometimes. The good news is ram prices have dropped over time and you can still get some really good deals on ram for less than what you would pay if you bought your memory from the Apple Store, or Costco, or even Walmart. And do you really want to buy your memory  from Apple? Apple is interested in one thing and that’s profit. Don’t let the apple koolaid get to you –  they are in business to make as much money as possible and will continue to do so over the years.</p>

<p>But  if you buy ram from some memory stores that specialize in Apple Memory and yet still  allow you  to get the best price you can on memory upgrades that meet Apple’s high standards.</p>

<p>It doesn’t cost much to upgrade the MacBook or MacBook Pro’s with the most RAM possible. You will be glad you did upgrade your computer as your computer will run faster  and will crash, well never. It’s a Mac. Fill it with memory and forget about what the costs of ram upgrades are until you are ready to buy memory again.</p>

<p>You’re here at this page because you want to do one thing: Buy Apple RAM Memory for Cheap.</p>

<p>But this does not mean that you dear reader, are cheap. No no no, this just means that you want to buy memory at the best price you can from a reputable store that offers free shipping, hassle free warranty and knows Apple Memory and RAM inside and out. With new Apple Models comign out from Apple all the time you know that after spending all that money on a new Mac computer, it only makes sense to buy memory from memory stores that support you and also the mac community.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW"><img title="Cheap Apple Memory" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-8.33.14-PM.png" alt="Best Priced Apple RAM" width="525" height="282" /></a></strong></p>

<div>
</div>

<p>Sure, you could buy ram from some generic computer store but these guys are just moving boxes for the most part. They have no idea about the individual apple computer or what memory your mac takes, and there’s a real good chance they don’t even care. This is why you want to buy apple ram from apple authorized memory stores that support the  Apple community, because believe it or not, we’re all in this together. yes, that means you with the apple logo shaved into the back of your head.</p>

<p>And this is why I only  list the best memory for Apple from the best stores for Apple Memory: The ones that specialize in Apple Memory and not much else. Vendors like Crucial,  OWC, MemoryX, 1-800-4-Memory , RAMJET  just to name a few. We’re  talking years and years of  experience of making memory (yes, that’s right, they actually make the ram to precise apple specifications) just for your new or old Mac so that it will run the fastest it possibly can but without any startup issues or crashes due to buying bad ram.</p>

<p>If you’re looking for Cheap RAM, stop.  Pay a few dollars more (we’re talking less than a coffee at starbucks here for most memory stores)  and  buy ram that’s not cheap, but is good. In fact, it’s great.</p>

<p>I know my time is important to me, so that’s why when I upgrade my apple computer,  I **buy the best ram at the best price **I can find  from a memory store I can trust and then, I’m done.</p>

<p>When shopping for ram or memory upgrades for the Apple MacBooks that released earlier this year in 2010 you don’t need to really worry about what the fastest ram is. Speed, really isn’t the issue here. Yes, it has to be DDR3 1066 SDRAM but there’s no fast ram or slow ram for the new Apple Macbooks.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1388" title="Cheapest Appel MacBook Pro" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-8.36.11-PM.png" alt="Best Price on new macbook pro" width="525" height="299" /></a><br />

<p>In fact, there’s no Apple RAM, as long as the memory is certified to be compatible with Apple, you’re good.</p>

<p>I’d be much more concerned about two things when shopping for Apple MacBook Pro RAM:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Price.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Customer  Service.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Some days, you’ll luck out and get the best  of both worlds, and  if you do buy from any of the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="apple memory store">Apple Memory Stores </a>I list you’ll do just fine in both regards. Every memory store I list has been with me for way longer than the MacBook Pro has been around, so you’re sure to get good customer service and a fair price from any vendor.</p>

<p>That said, don’t be surprised that like all things in life, you get what you pay for and the lowest price might not be the best deal sometimes. (Not always but it happens)</p>

<p>The memory stores that always offer the lowest prices on RAM do so because  they’re hoping for volume. If they sell 100 orders a day and make a dollar each, they’ve profited $100. But  they have to deal with 100 different  customers. Customers that are more concerned about price than service a lot of times and don’t care that the memory takes longer to ship, or that the store’s lifetime warranty might not be up to snuff. He’s a busy man – he’s got 100 cheap customers to ship ram to today.</p>

<p>In contrast let’s take the memory vendor that offers ram for a few dollars more. Because he’s making ten dollars on each sale, he (or she) makes only ten sales to reach  that hundred dollars. This store is happy to to make less, but not have to deal with the more price concious consumers. Because vendor B only has ten orders to ship, they’re more than willing to help you troubleshoot, answer pre-order questions or hold your hand along the way and offers support if you need it.</p>

<p>I list both at ramseeker and always have – and have never promoted the lowest price. I allow you to chose  which is more important to you: low price or better service</p>

<p>Again you lucked out, and I don’t list any stores that don’t specialize in memory upgrades and have watched more than one low price leader go the way of the dodo bird over the years.</p>

<p>So when I get questions on what is the fastest ram or what is the best ram, I always say: Pick the price and store that you like and order ram from any of the memory stores I list and you will be happy with your memory purchase.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2010/04/what-does-upgrading-imac-memory-cost/">What does upgrading iMac Memory Cost?</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>[table id=2 /]</p>

<p>The prices, or costs for the different Apple iMac Models and memory upgrades over the years have changed as new technology has been introduced, which results in new Apple Mac Memory being needed depending on what model of iMac you plan to upgrade with more memory.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8IO6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8IO6">Cheapest Apple iMacs</a></strong></p>

<p>The latest iMacs released in 2008 and 2009 require the use of DDR3 1066 SDRAM so-dimms, and depending on the particular iMac you have you can upgrade to either 4gb or 8gb of ram for the newer, modern iMacs.  About a year ago when the newest iMac models at the time were released – 8gb of ram for the iMacs would cost as much as the computer itself. 8GB memory kits, especially when you bought them from the Apple Store directly were prohibitively expensive at prices hovering around the $1000 mark for an 8GB iMac ram upgrade kit.</p>

<p><strong>iMac Prices Have Dropped</strong></p>

<p>Thanks to more demand of the 8GB memory kits  the prices have dropped considerably when you want to buy two 4 gig memory modules and install them in your new Apple iMac. Now (spring 2010), <strong>the cost to max out your iMac and fill it with ram is a much more reasonable cost of about $350-400.</strong></p>

<p>The 4GB memory upgrades from Apple have even dropped recently, so though it still costs more to upgrade your iMac when you<a href="http://www.apple.com" title="apple ram"> buy ram directly from Apple</a>, it’s a possibility now as the prices, while still more than if you bought the ram from a third party memory shop, is priced more reasonably than before. But you’ll still pay about a $100-200 price for the Apple RAM over the same ram when bought elsewhere.</p>

<p>The 4GB RAM and memory modules (1066 DDR3)  are still pricier than their smaller sized memory chips. If you can get away with it, you might be able to <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/iMac_KITS_(DDR3_1066)/" title="save money on imac ram">save</a></strong> <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/iMac_KITS_(DDR3_1066)/" title="save money on imac ram">some money on iMac ram</a></strong> by not maxing out your current Apple iMac and just upgrading to 4GB with 2×2 memory modules as the 2GB ram is still priced much lower than the 4gb module. It would make sense that if a 2gb module costs $1, than a 4GB memory upgrade would be priced at $2, but not so. At time of writing this, 2GB RAM for iMacs costs about $44.00, while the 4GB RAM for Apple iMacs cost 4x as much with street prices being in the $175-200 range from most stores.</p>

<p>It really is up to you to decide what the best ram upgrade option is for your iMac. If you can afford to, and justify <strong>the cost an 8GB iMac upgrade makes the most sense</strong> as you will get the fastest speed from your iMac. But if money is a factor, you should work  with the 4GB upgrade kit. <strong>4gb of RAM is more than enough memory</strong> for the tasks suited to the iMac, such as web browsing, email  and using the iLife software that came with your Apple iMac.</p>

<p>If you need any help with <strong>RAM upgrades for your iMac,</strong> I’m more than happy to help.</p>

		<div class="post-content"><p><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="imac ram">iMac RAM</a>, or iMac Memory if you prefer, comes in many different memory configurations and specifications over the years as Apple has elected to keep the iMac monitor regardless of processor or even design changes, as soon as the last model is replaced with a new model, the new model is called iMac and is the older iMac model. As far as apple is concerned, an iMac is whatever th e most current version of the iMac Family.</p>

<p>**iMac Names **</p>

<p>Sometimes to avoid confusion, Apple will add a description to their iMacs such as iMac Intel i5 processor, or iMac G5 , or even iMac 27 inch. Some way to differentiate between the many iMac models. But for the most part, and especially when marketing Apple’s consumer based all in one desktop computer. Then it’s just iMac. But when you’re shopping for an iMac from even the apple store or amazon or looking up info in the apple knowledgebase the iMac model is usually specified by some name other than just iMac.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/iMac_(DDR3_1066)/" title="iMac Memory">iMac Memory </a></strong></p>

<p>When it comes down to iMac Memory, and when there was only the first iMac available, things were pretty easy  –  I created a page specifically for iMac RAM, and didnt’ do much planning for future iMacs to be honest. And then Apple went and released the slot loading iMac and now I had to differentiate between the two iMac models as they now take different memory. But, as there was only two different iMac models at the time I still, just made another page and called it iMac 350 to 500, or something along those lines.</p>

<p>Apple went  and really put the kinks into my plans when they released the iMac Flat Panel models as then I had to not only track the lowest price, but there was two different types of RAM – one slot was user accessible yet the other slot you had to take your iMac into an apple certified repair center to get the other ram slot upgraded (what a stupid system, eh?). But still, there’s only 3 iMacs so I just made a new page to track the new ram that these new iMacs came with (pc133 sodimms) and i created a page called PC133. The Flat Panel iMacs release is when I had to rethink for future iMacs as I realized that this was the future, and apple would once release new computers that were new iMacs and completely different than their predecessors, yet would be named just iMac.</p>

<p>With the release of the new Flat Panel iMacs that took PC2100 DDR sdram sodimms, I would just name the model and then (usually in brackets) I would put the memory type to differentiate the different iMac models.</p>

<p>I continue with this naming strategy, up to and including the iMacs with Intel i5 processors as these models take DDR3 1066 SDRAM  so the pages are named in the format of: Model Name (Memory Type) for the current and all iMac models.</p>

<p>The only downside for this system is that you have to know what memory type you need to take full advantage. I have tried to make things easier for you by separating the pull down menu so that I list current apple models first, and then list the older discontinued models.</p>

<p>If you need any help with iMac RAM you can feel free to contact me and I will be glad to help you get the right memory for your iMac at the best price.</p>

<p>I have specialized in Apple Memory for over 13 years and have tracked memory prices for each and every mac made since about 1997, starting with the Beige PowerMac G3 desktops and working all the way through iBooks, iMacs and PowerBook and MacBook Pro RAM.</p>

<p>So today I thought I’d start with a little primer on the what apple ram you need for your mac computer. Now I realize that there’s very little demand for older mac memory as its’ been my personal experience to upgrade my computer when I buy it to the fullest capacity over the years and then just forget about it. But if you’ve got an older Mac Computer you want to upgrades – maybe it’s a hand me down, or a hobby project, or maybe you just need a cheap computer for some word processing tasks, then older macs are still a very viable solution. You don’t need to spend thousands of dollars on a new MacBook Pro if all you’re doing is some email and web work. A used Macbook would do you quite nicely. But regardless of the model of older mac computer you end up buying you can still get a good deal more use out of it if you buy some more memory. Especially on the older Macs – adding more ram or adding a bigger hard drive can mean a world of difference in performance.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/Power_Mac_G3_(Beige)/" title="Beige Desktop G3 RAM">Beige Desktop G3 RAM</a></strong></p>

<p>The memory on the beige G3’s can run 256mb memory modules and you can still buy 256mb ram for beige G3’s for just $15. The memory you need for this computer is PC100 SDRAM</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/Power_Mac_G3_(Blue_White)/">Blue and white PowerMac G3</a></strong></p>

<p>It seems just like yesterday that these were released with their cool  iMac inspired color schemes and cool handles to carry them and the nifty way the entire side of the computer swings out for easy ram upgrades. These will accept 256mb memory upgrades that cost as little as $15 these days.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/Power_Mac_G4_(PC100)/" title="powermac g4 memory">PowerMac G4 PC100</a></strong></p>

<p>These  PowerMac  G4’s used pretty much the same case as the Blue and White PowerMac G3’s but that’s where the difference ended for these computers. PC100 SDRAM is used in these models, regardless whether you had the ‘yikes’ version or the AGP video card version. These accepted 512mb  which is now priced at $23 and up.</p>

<p>These 3 desktop  computers from Apple are just a few of the older mac computers I still track and monitor memory prices for. Even though these discontinued Macs are deemed obsolete by today’s standards, if you fill them with RAM and upgrade the hard drives they can still be considered great little computers for email or word processing.</p>

<p>PC memory has really dropped in prices over the last few years. Ten years ago, 1GB of <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/pc/" title="ram for pc">RAM for a PC </a>would have cost over two thousand dollars when it was first released.  It has been my experiences that the price of ram just keeps getting cheaper and cheaper until demand for the memory starts to dwindle due to new technologies being released over time and  the older ram usally rises in price a small percentage as the demand drops.</p>

<p><strong>It doesn’t matter what ram costs</strong></p>

<p>[table id=7 /]</p>

<div>
</div>

<p>Regardless of whether you are buying a PC  or Apple computer, or perhaps you’re creating a new PC from scratch  and you need ram it is always best to buy the most ram  you can afford as the benefits far outweigh the costs.</p>

<p>For example 8GB 1066 DDR3 memory (also known as DDR3 PC8500) is priced still pretty expensively. Not as much as a year ago, where it would cost you over a thousand dollars for this memory configuration, but enough still today that 8G of DDR3 will cost in the $400 to $500 price range.</p>

<p>If you can do with smaller amounts of ram, 1GB of  DDR3 ram for PC’s  costs under $20. The ram prices for 1GB have risen in recent months down from a low of $11.00 for 1GB  of RAM. If you need more than 1GB of memory, the 2GB RAM for most desktop and laptop PC computers costs just $40 or so, which is another bargain. If you’ve been paying attention this works out to double what the 1GB RAM costs so you will still be getting a bargain.</p>

<p>It’s only when you get into either exotic memory types (such as RAMBUS or RDRAM) or larger sizes, where the technology and demand haven’t met up yet for the sweet spot of memory upgrade and low price – is where you’ll get bitten for a high ram price.</p>

<p>The 2Gb memory size at the time being seems to be the best size of memory module for your PC computer – it doesn’t matter  – desktop or notebook computers. On notebook computers you are usually physically limited  due to size and also heat  on how much ram you can install in a netbook or notebook computer. On a desktop computer your ram upgrade options are usually much more as you have more ram slots to install memory into and so on most PC’s you can use cheap ram with small sizes to save money on ram upgrades.</p>

<p>Your PC manufacturer will be able  to help you with how much RAM you can install and what type of ram you need, but when yo have this information at your arsenal you can upgrade the memory to the maximum.<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="ram is cheap"> RAM is cheap</a>. Max out the ram on your PC and you can enjoy years of trouble free computing.</p>
