   <B> <h1><a href="/2010/07/what-is-the-best-ram-for-macbook-pro/">What is the Best RAM for MacBook Pro?</a></h1></B>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>[table id=15 /]</p>

<p><strong>The best Apple  MacBook Pro 2011 RAM</strong>, or memory as it’s also know is the RAM that meets your specific MacBook Pro’s requirements. Frankly, if you buy pretty much any  ram that’s specified for your MacBook Pro and the thing boots up  – you’re good.<strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I">Best MacBook Pro Price</a></strong></p>

<p>There was one time many many years ago when all memory wasn’t the same and a lot of stores will try to get you to believe their ram is the best ram in the entire world but when it comes down to buttons and  brass tacks, all ram is pretty much the same as long as it’s tested and built to you specific Apple MacBook Pro memory requirements.</p>

<p>**But what’s the difference in MacBook Pro RAM? **</p>

<p>Customer service in my opinion. Is it easy to order online? Is your credit card secure when you place your order for MacBook Pro memory?</p>

<p>How about knowledge of the products they sell? Some memory stores are more interested in the lowest memory prices, and make up for any losses in sheer volume. Other memory sellers would much prefer a higher end customer that places an order for hundreds of quality ram parts all at once and so they market to those customers and go after the big corporate and school memory sales. Schools, especially can’t afford to upgrade their Macs every year- especially in this sour economy and budget cuts so what they do is upgrade the ram for every computer in the school. That’s a pretty big memory order and can make or break a memory store’s bottom line.</p>

<p>But all you came here for was the best deal on the best RAM for your MacBook Pro. You love how the keyboard feels on your MacBook Pro, and how that 13 inch or 15 inch MacBook Screen is bright and all the free iApps that Apple included pretty much get every user  up and running with word processing, web browsing and email right out of the box. But now you just want to increase the MacBook Pro’s performance and get the best deal on  RAM as money is money, and the economy sucks and heck,  you might not even know if you’ll have a job next week so saving money on anything you buy, MacBook Cases, RAM or hard drive. All you know is you need RAM. Maybe you read a Mac Blog or the guy at the Apple Store told you you should upgrade your ram to get the most out of your MacBook Pro it doesn’t matter how you ended up sitting in front of your computer and  searching for the best value MacBook RAM,  you’re here and you want to know one thing and one thing only :</p>

<p>**What’s the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_Pro_KITS_(1066_DDR3)/" title="best ram for macbook pro">Best RAM for MacBook Pro</a>? **</p>

<p>I think you’ll find the best RAM for MacBook Pro  from a number of memory stores, and yes even Apple Store is you’re so inlined.. You’ll pay a bit more for it, and it’s a big pain booking an appointment at the Genius bar but at least you’ll be feeling the Apple vibe while you wait in line to get your MacBook fixed because the RAM doesn’t work.  Or, you could buy RAM form a list of Apple Memory stores that have been in business for over a decade and specialize  in nothing but RAM for your new or old MacBook Pro, and other macs too – iMacs, Mac Minis, Mac Pros, even those PC’s  you mac fans love to hate: Dell Memory, Toshiba RAM, Sony Memory – it doesn’t matter  as they are all very very reputable online memory stores that do nothing  but specialize in <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="apple memory upgrades">Memory Upgrades for Apple</a>.</p>

   <B> <h1><a href="/2010/07/8gb-macbook-pro-ram-prices/">8GB MacBook Pro RAM Prices</a></h1></B>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I">Cheapest MacBook Pro Deal</a></strong></p>

<p>Where to Buy 8GB of RAM? Well, that depends. If you want the lowest price you can find for Apple MacBook Memory you should scoot over  the the front page of ramseeker  and use my handy-dandy memory configurator  I’ve whipped up for you to useThe latest MacBook Models from Apple can now accept up to 8GB of ram which is quite a significant jump from the 4gb maximum of even a year or so ago. Why the increase of MacBook Pro memory 8GB. One factor that shouldn’t be overlooked is price. <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="ram prices drop">ram prices drop</a> over time and  at one point not too long ago you would have to pay a lot more money to get 8gb of RAM into any Apple Mac, not just the MacBooks and MacBook Pros. For a long time, the only Apple Computers that would accept more than 8GB of RAM were Mac Pro Models and even they maxed out at 32gb.</p>

<div>
</div>

<p>Let me explain a bit on how I categorize the Apple Memory into Groups. Long, long ago when I started I only had to worry about listing a few ram prices for popular Macs. This was back in the day of the PowerMac G3’s and  even 32mb would set you back a pretty penny. 1GB of ram would cost over $1000 and so it was pretty simple as I only had a few pages to keep track of all the memory  that I do here on ramseeker.</p>

<p>But then, Apple couldn’t leave well enough alone. Nope,  they had to come out with  new models all the time. First, the iBooks came out and then a bit later the MacBooks and MacBook Pros (an aside:  I never cared for my black macbook I used to have – it showed the fingerprints too easy). So I added more pages to <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="ramseeker">ramseeker</a>, and more and more memory stores and started a discontinued section for all the Apple Models that were, well – discontinued.</p>

<p>That’s all fine and dandy but then about  2003 or so, Apple changed the specifications on some of their Macs where you had to buy the memory in matched pairs –  0r memory upgrade kits – as I call them. And it seems as some memory stores started to list their memory upgrades for the Mac as memory upgrade kits and some other  – nope, they stuck to their guns and still listed all their memory upgrades as individual modules.</p>

<p>That’s fine, but how can I differentiate? I can’t list both memory kits for the MacBook Pro  and Memory Modules for the MacBook Pros on the same page as that wouldn’t be fair. When you go to sort by price when comparing ram prices the module prices would always show first, and then the memory upgrade KITs would come next, and that’s no good. So what I did was make two pages. One for MacBook Pro – single  module and another page for MacBook Pro KIT, including the 8GB Memory Kits that are such a good deal these days.</p>

<p>But it’s still a bit confusing when shopping for 8GB MacBook Kits as the older MacBook Pros accepted PC5300 DR2 SO -DIMMS but the newer MacBook Pro Models took the DDR3 1066 MHZ so there’s that to differntiate from too when MacBook Pro Memory Shopping.</p>

<p>But  here’ what you need. You need MacBook Pro DDR3 1066 ram prices, and check both the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_Pro_KITS_(1066_DDR3)/" title="Apple MacBook Pro Memory Kits">MacBook Pro Memory upgrade kits </a>and the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_Pro_(1066_DDR3)/" title="macbook pro memory modules">MacBook Pro memory modules</a> to0,as you never know who has the best deal on ram, and you shouldn’t discount the guys who choose to sell their ram individually instead of a package deal</p>

<p>Do your homework and  you’ll get the best deal you can on 8GB MacBook Pro RAM Prices.</p>

<p>When you are in need of memory for computer – and this applies to all types of computers regardess of  computer maker or model – there are a few things to consider before you call your local computer shop, buy memory online or start to search eBay for your computer memory needs.</p>

<p><a href="&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1375" title="Best Apple Computer Memory" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-8.22.30-PM.png" alt="Cheap Computer RAM" width="542" height="285" /></a></p>

<p><strong><a href="&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW">Cheap Computer Memory</a></strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Price</strong>. Is the computer memory you are interested in for you particular computer priced competitively? You’re going to get a much better deal on your computer memory if you buy it from a third party memory store that specializes in memory for Apple for an example than if you buy the memory from Apple directly (although in recent times Apple memory from the Apple Store is getting more competitive)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Compatibility</strong>. Will the memory you want work in your computer without issue? Have all the manufacturer’s memory specifications been met so that when you go to install the memory you will be sure that the computer memory you bought works with your computer. Memory is fragile and susceptible to  damage from static electricity.  Installing bad ram could mean your computer does not run smoothly or even not at all after you installed bad ram.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Customer service</strong>. If your main objective is number 1 above, price, you may have to be wiling to be sacrifice customer service for price. Are you willing to make that sacrifice. Personally  I am not and  would much rather buy my ram from a memory store I know and trust. Better yet if the store specializes in nothing but memory.  If you make your living with your computer, ask yourself how much your time is worth. Do you have th time and patience  and are willing to sacrifice the potential of lost income, just because your memory failed due to the fact that you bought cheap ram from a questionable price.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The good news is you can buy ram with confidence and get numbers 1,2 and 3 when you buy the memory from one of the vendors I recommend. all and any of the memory stores you see on ramseeker have been in the comptuter memory business for over a decade and do nothing all day but to sell you the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="best memory best prices">best memory upgrades at the best price</a>.</p>

<p>Whatever your memory ugpgrade needs might be, you owe it to yourself to get the best deal on the beset ram at the best price with the least amount of time and aggravation.</p>

<div style="float: right; margin-right: 5px;">
</div>

<p>Despite the fact that notebook computers seem to be outpacing the sales of desktop computers, there’s lots of times when buying a cheap desktop computer is a better deal than buying a cheap netbook, or laptop computer.</p>

<p>A desktop computer does indeed usually lack a handle to make it truly portable, but for the most part the desktop rises head and shoulders above the desktop computer for one reason that stands out in my mind and that’s expadability. The desktop computer usually has lots of room for <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="memory for desktops">memory upgrades</a>.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013FK9U2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0013FK9U2"><img title="Best Selling Apple Desktop" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-8.18.44-PM.png" alt="Cheap Desktop Computers" width="475" height="228" /></a></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013FK9U2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0013FK9U2">Apple Mac Mini. Best Selling Desktop Computer</a></strong></p>

<p>Desktop RAM is priced usually pretty much the same as notebook memory but the benefit of buying ram for your desktop is you can buy more ram  which in turn means more performance out of your desktop computer. Now if  all you use is a word processing document you don’t need to worry about speed as much as the computer is going to  be waiting on you to type. There’s a good chance that if all you use to compute is to do light email and web surfing and some data entry you don’t have to worry too much about computer speed. The computer, either desktop  or notebook will be waiting for you to finish typing. In the meantime, it just waits.</p>

<p>But, if you are a graphic designer, or  use  photo imaging tools such as photoshop or lightroom you’re going to need all the ram you can get your hands on, or at very least – all the memory you can afford to buy. Hard drives too but that’s another post all in itself.</p>

<p>You have your desktop computer and it’s too slow. You need to buy more ram. How much RAM you can add to your desktop will depend usually on the motherboard and how many memory upgrade slots are available. Can you install the memory in pairs?  Can you keep the the memory you have in the computer already, or will you need  to upgrade all your memory and replace the RAM you have? All these are good questions to ask and consider before you go looking to buy cheap ram for your desktop.</p>

<p>The good news is every memory store offers what is called as a memory configurator. It’s a pretty fancy term but all it does is help you find the the best ram you need at the best price. You usually enter  your computer brand,  or sometimes your motherboard type if the PC you want to upgrade is hand built by you or a custom PC store. The next thing the configurator does is ask you about the model of your computer</p>

<p>To find the model of your computer can sometimes be a bit tricky but it’s usually written on the back of your desktop computer or sometimes on the bottom if you have a notebook or  laptop. Once you have brand and model name of your computer a customized page on the memory store’s website is returned to you exlaining all you need to know about memory upgrade choices for your computer. Size of ram you need to get to the ram upgrade you want and whether you need to upgrade the memory in pairs, or if you can get away with just buying one memory module at a time.</p>

<p>Somes stores even offer different choices in quality: You can chose to buy more expensive but with higher quality parts – name brand memory. Or if your budget is tight and you just want to buy the cheapest ram you can find then they offer that too.</p>

<p>Buying cheap ram whether in desktop form or a notebook is not hard and you’ll get the best price on ram if you compare prices on ram  from a selection of stores as all memory stores offer different prices for their desktop memory. Take your time, find your desktop computer brand and model name and find a memory store you can trust and use their memory configurator to get the beat deal on desktop ram..</p>

<p>The answer to your question: what’s the most ram I can put into a macbook? is 4GB of RAM  can go into an Apple MacBook, if it’s the most recent model of Apple MacBook, or even a pretty recent model you can install 4GB of  RAM into the two slots. To do this, you will need to buy macbook ram in pairs, or single memory modules. There’s no real difference between the pairs and the  individual memory modules except for the fact that some stores sell macbook memory in kits, as opposed to individual pieces of ram.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002C7489S/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002C7489S"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1378" title="Cheap Apple MacBook" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-8.25.19-PM.png" alt="Best Price Apple MacBook" width="573" height="312" /></a></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002C7489S/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002C7489S">Cheapest Apple MacBook</a></strong></p>

<p>With the Macbooks, there are 2 different ram types you should consider: PC2 5300 DDR so-dimms were the first ram modules made available for macbook laptop computers, but as apple kept on releasing newer and newer macbooks they changed the memory requirements to DDR3 ram which runs at 1066MHz and that is the memory type that all newer macbooks require.</p>

<p>There’s a good chance your macbook came from the factory shipped with  just 2GB of memory installed wit 1x2gb in each available memory upgrade slot, so to upgrade to 4gb you will need to buy 2 2gb ram modules to buy ram for your macbook computer</p>

<p>If your macbook is new and released in 2010: 4GB</p>

<p>If you have an older macbook you want to upgrade, then chances are it’s maxed out already at 2GB  but be sure to check your model and then ask one of my recommended<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="where to buy memory"> memory stores t</a>o ask and double check your macbook memory requirements.</p>

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>Probably two of the hottest selling electronics right now have to be Mac Laptops otherwise known as MacBook and MacBook Pro and digital cameras. And the best part, is that without the one, you can’t use the other. A digital camera is pretty much useless if you cannot transfer your photos to your Mac Laptop and then share the with the world, or at very least your friends and family. And when you buy a mac laptop you are equipped with Apple’s software suite right out of the box and that includes iPhoto which offers a fast and easy way to organize, edit and share your photos.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I">MacBook Pro: Best Selling Apple Laptop</a></strong></p>

<p>**Where to Buy a Mac Laptop and Digital Camera. **</p>

<p>If you buy your Macbook from the Apple Store, you can save money but only on the refurbished Macbooks.  And these are fine and and easy way  to save some money, but for this article I am going to assume you want to buy a new mac laptop. Maybe you are starting school soon and you need to buy a new mac laptop  to take with you when you go away to school. I have searched high and low and I found the easiest way to save money on a Mac Laptop and a digital camera is to buy the two together at Amazon.</p>

<p>The reason for this is that when you do this you will get a deal on both and in some cases you can add accessories to both and save even more money on the macbook or macbook pro. One Apple notebook bundle you might want to consider is one that includes a case, and an extra charger and maybe some special cleaner for the display, or how about an extra charger? You can get  a pretty great deal on Apple bundles.</p>

<p>Right now, when you buy a new macbook you can get a free iPod too. This is only a back to school offer so if you’re interested in doing this I would buy your macbook soooner than later</p>

<p>For the digital cameras, there are many choices and I have written enough  for now, but you apply the same logic when buying a digital camer too. Find the discount digital camera you want and start adding accessories such as extra lenses. There are many ways to expand your digital camera with cases and digital camera memory too, so it’s best to bundle.</p>

<p>When you wan to get a deal on a Mac Laptop and Digital Camera, do your homework when making your choices and when you are ready to buy a macbook or buy a digital camera you will happy with the choices you have made.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: I orginally wrote this is 2010, and now that <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/2011-apple-macbook-pros-announced/" title="2011 Apple MacBook Pros Announced">2011 MacBook Pros</a> are readily available  I  thought it might be wise to update the <strong>MacBook Pro memory chart</strong> below to include <strong>2011 Apple MacBook Pro Memory Prices</strong> as well.<br />
[table id=15 /]</p>

<p>The ram below is for the <strong>February 2011 Apple MacBook Pro models</strong> and can accept up to 8GB of RAM, according to Apple and 16Gb if you ask a few other memory stores. I don’t recommend you install more than 8GB of memory as this is the maximum MacBook Pro memory specification as indicated by Apple.</p>

<p>[table id=7/]</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The Best Memory for MacBook Pro 2010 really just needs to be cheap, good and meet  apple’s standards for memory upgrades.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1380" title="Apple MacBook Pro" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-8.27.38-PM.png" alt="Best Selling Apple Laptop" width="517" height="321" /></a></p>

<p>That’s  it.</p>

<p>What  I can tell you is that the MacBook Pro’s for 2010 have two slots and with the spring 2010 refresh, all the MacBook Pros can now accept up to 8 GB of  RAM.</p>

<p>You’ll need to buy DDR3 1066 SDRAM so-dimms and I suggest visiting one of the memory stores I already track prices for as these guys both know their stuff and have macbook memory in stock and ready to ship. If you want, you can pay a bit more and buy crucial memory and you’re paying for the brand name and all those full color glossy ads in the magazines. But they offer a a good product at  a pretty competetive price.</p>

<p>they are not the cheapest around for MacBook Pro RAM so if every penny and dollar counts, check for prices on MacBook Memory and find the beat deal on ram for the MacBook Pro’s that you can and go with it. The RAM for the MacBook Pros is  easy to install. I found the bottom of the macbook case to be a bit fiddly to get off but once I had it’s just a matter of slipping out the old ram and installing two four gig macbook ram chips if you’re looking to upgrade to the full 8GB on the MacBook Pros.</p>

<p>Can you get away with 4GB?  Sure and if you’re doing most emailing and web browsing you’ll be fine. But it is my opinion you should max out the macbook pro memory. You have  paid apple for pro features anyway so you might as well dip into your pockets just a bit more and get the most ram you can possibly install with a MacBook Pro. Ram for the MacBook Pros is pretty cheap these days and you’ll never have enough ram.</p>

<p>But there really is no Best Memory for MacBook Pro’s. Buy from a company that specializes in Apple RAM and you’ll do fine.</p>

<p>** It does not cost a  lot  of money  to add ram to a MacBook.**</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I">Macbook Pro is the Best Selling MacBook</a></strong></p>

<p>In fact, the cost is so low these days, that ram prices and comparing ram prices over time you will find that the price to add ram to macbook is so very cheap that it doesn’t make sense not to add ram to your macbook, or macbook pro or any other portable apple computer you have or thinking of  buying.</p>

<p>When you buy a MacBook or MacBook Pro from Apple, or Amazon, or MacMall, or wherever else you want to buy an apple computer from you should always upgrade your macbook or macbook pro ram and memory to the maximum amout of memory  you possibly can, or in some cases, afford to.</p>

<p>If you can afford to upgrade your memory, why not do it in a way that makes sense? Don’t buy the first memory upgrade you see. Yes, you might be able to buy memory from your macbook pro or macbook right from  apple, but when you buy memory from apple, the ram is very expensive and you can buy cheaper ram from other  online memory stores for much less money than what you would spend if you bought the same memory from anywhere else, including the Apple Store.</p>

<p>If you need to<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="buy ram apple computer"> buy ram for any apple computer</a>, I suggest go check ram prices as they change daily sometimes. The good news is ram prices have dropped over time and you can still get some really good deals on ram for less than what you would pay if you bought your memory from the Apple Store, or Costco, or even Walmart. And do you really want to buy your memory  from Apple? Apple is interested in one thing and that’s profit. Don’t let the apple koolaid get to you –  they are in business to make as much money as possible and will continue to do so over the years.</p>

<p>But  if you buy ram from some memory stores that specialize in Apple Memory and yet still  allow you  to get the best price you can on memory upgrades that meet Apple’s high standards.</p>

<p>It doesn’t cost much to upgrade the MacBook or MacBook Pro’s with the most RAM possible. You will be glad you did upgrade your computer as your computer will run faster  and will crash, well never. It’s a Mac. Fill it with memory and forget about what the costs of ram upgrades are until you are ready to buy memory again.</p>

<p>You’re here at this page because you want to do one thing: Buy Apple RAM Memory for Cheap.</p>

<p>But this does not mean that you dear reader, are cheap. No no no, this just means that you want to buy memory at the best price you can from a reputable store that offers free shipping, hassle free warranty and knows Apple Memory and RAM inside and out. With new Apple Models comign out from Apple all the time you know that after spending all that money on a new Mac computer, it only makes sense to buy memory from memory stores that support you and also the mac community.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW"><img title="Cheap Apple Memory" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-8.33.14-PM.png" alt="Best Priced Apple RAM" width="525" height="282" /></a></strong></p>

<p>Sure, you could buy ram from some generic computer store but these guys are just moving boxes for the most part. They have no idea about the individual apple computer or what memory your mac takes, and there’s a real good chance they don’t even care. This is why you want to buy apple ram from apple authorized memory stores that support the  Apple community, because believe it or not, we’re all in this together. yes, that means you with the apple logo shaved into the back of your head.</p>

<p>And this is why I only  list the best memory for Apple from the best stores for Apple Memory: The ones that specialize in Apple Memory and not much else. Vendors like Crucial,  OWC, MemoryX, 1-800-4-Memory , RAMJET  just to name a few. We’re  talking years and years of  experience of making memory (yes, that’s right, they actually make the ram to precise apple specifications) just for your new or old Mac so that it will run the fastest it possibly can but without any startup issues or crashes due to buying bad ram.</p>

<p>If you’re looking for Cheap RAM, stop.  Pay a few dollars more (we’re talking less than a coffee at starbucks here for most memory stores)  and  buy ram that’s not cheap, but is good. In fact, it’s great.</p>

<p>I know my time is important to me, so that’s why when I upgrade my apple computer,  I **buy the best ram at the best price **I can find  from a memory store I can trust and then, I’m done.</p>

<p>When shopping for ram or memory upgrades for the Apple MacBooks that released earlier this year in 2010 you don’t need to really worry about what the fastest ram is. Speed, really isn’t the issue here. Yes, it has to be DDR3 1066 SDRAM but there’s no fast ram or slow ram for the new Apple Macbooks.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1388" title="Cheapest Appel MacBook Pro" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-8.36.11-PM.png" alt="Best Price on new macbook pro" width="525" height="299" /></a><br />

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I">Best MacBook Pro Prices</a></strong></p>

<p>In fact, there’s no Apple RAM, as long as the memory is certified to be compatible with Apple, you’re good.</p>

<p>I’d be much more concerned about two things when shopping for Apple MacBook Pro RAM:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Price.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Customer  Service.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Some days, you’ll luck out and get the best  of both worlds, and  if you do buy from any of the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="apple memory store">Apple Memory Stores </a>I list you’ll do just fine in both regards. Every memory store I list has been with me for way longer than the MacBook Pro has been around, so you’re sure to get good customer service and a fair price from any vendor.</p>

<p>That said, don’t be surprised that like all things in life, you get what you pay for and the lowest price might not be the best deal sometimes. (Not always but it happens)</p>

<p>The memory stores that always offer the lowest prices on RAM do so because  they’re hoping for volume. If they sell 100 orders a day and make a dollar each, they’ve profited $100. But  they have to deal with 100 different  customers. Customers that are more concerned about price than service a lot of times and don’t care that the memory takes longer to ship, or that the store’s lifetime warranty might not be up to snuff. He’s a busy man – he’s got 100 cheap customers to ship ram to today.</p>

<p>In contrast let’s take the memory vendor that offers ram for a few dollars more. Because he’s making ten dollars on each sale, he (or she) makes only ten sales to reach  that hundred dollars. This store is happy to to make less, but not have to deal with the more price concious consumers. Because vendor B only has ten orders to ship, they’re more than willing to help you troubleshoot, answer pre-order questions or hold your hand along the way and offers support if you need it.</p>

<p>I list both at ramseeker and always have – and have never promoted the lowest price. I allow you to chose  which is more important to you: low price or better service</p>

<p>Again you lucked out, and I don’t list any stores that don’t specialize in memory upgrades and have watched more than one low price leader go the way of the dodo bird over the years.</p>

<p>So when I get questions on what is the fastest ram or what is the best ram, I always say: Pick the price and store that you like and order ram from any of the memory stores I list and you will be happy with your memory purchase.</p>
