<p>This isn’t something that the hard drive manufacturers like to talk about, but it really is common sense: Most hard drives in use today use moving parts and after a while, those parts stop moving due to use.  Hard Drives are sensitive electronics that don’t like to be jolted or moved, and despite the advances in solid state hard drives or even the technology in keeping standard old school hard drives free of damaging shock there may be a time when you need help with your hard drive</p>

<p><strong>Western Digital Hard Drive Help</strong></p>

<p>There’s more than one manufacturer of hard drives and names like Seagate, Buffalo and even memory manufacturers are now getting into the game when it  comes to solid state drives, but Western Digital might very well be the best selling hard drive manufacturer in 2012 and beyond.</p>

<p>I have been lucky to not experience a hard drive failure in recent  times, so I haven’t had to call or email Western Digital for support. I did have to contact LaCie once but that was due to the fact that I lost the cables associated with the drive in a move and had to order new cables for once was at a time a very large hard dive at 1TB.</p>

<p>But if you haven’t been so lucky and need help with your hard drive from Western Digital, you’re usually in luck as most hard drive failures tend to happen in the first few months if they’re going to fail and this will happen  well into the two year limited warranty that comes with each Western Digital Hard Drive.</p>

<p>To contact Western Digital your best bet is to visit the <a href="http://support.wdc.com/">western digital support page</a> where you can find answers to your hard drive support questions including dowloads, registration, warranty services, installation help as well as phone and email support too.</p>

<p>I hope you’ve been lucky as I have when it comes to hard drive failure, but if you do need help with your WD hard drive, the folks at Western Digital are happy to help</p>

		<div class="post-content"><p>There’s two things I love about the internet:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>You can connect and interact with just about anybody and read and learn so much from each other.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You can shop online!</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>I have been shopping for notebook computer memory for close to 15 years now to help you guys get the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="best deal on ram">best deal on RAM</a>, and buy it much cheaper than from other over priced stores. (see the sidebar to the right of this article for some real cheap ram).</p>

<p>And one of the cheapest computers on sale right now tend to be from <a href="http://www.acer.com">Acer computer</a>. Add some memory to these cheapo notebooks and you’ve got a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/mn/search/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;scn=565108&amp;keywords=acer%20computer&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;qid=1325625023&amp;h=1bfcd6c6c93e9d31134cb3f88362b6f78c3f5b93&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;rh=n%3A565108%2Ck%3Aacer%20computer">fast and cheap notebook computer for under $600</a>.</p>

<p>Most all Acer notebooks come with a limited warranty, but usually once you’ve made your purchase the online store from which you bought your Acer won’t refund  your money and  this leaves you to have to contact Acer support in the rare case you do have a problem with your new Acer notebook.</p>

<p><strong>Acer  Contact Information</strong></p>

<p>To save you some time, here are the Acer Computer contact information:</p>

<p><a href="http://us.acer.com/ac/en/US/content/home">Acer USA</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.acer.ca/ac/en/CA/content/home">Acer Canada</a></p>

<p><a href="http://br.acer.com/ac/pt/BR/content/home">Acer Brasil </a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.acer.com.mx/ac/es/MX/content/home">Acer Mexico</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.acla.acer.com/ac/es/AR/content/home">Acer Latin America</a></p>

<p>There are also contact support for <a href="http://www.acer.com/worldwide/selection.htmlAc">Acer Europe and Acer Middle East and Asia Pacific </a>too, but the Americas tend to be the most popular when it comes to Acer users so I’ll stop the list there.</p>

<p>Once you find the region you are in you will be able to contact Acer  by phone or email and have any warranty issues you need to be taken care of. I have found that in the past most companies are willing to work with you when it comes to notebook warranty if you treat them like you would like to be treated</p>

<p>As a new Acer notebook PC  user, I hope to never have to use these contact numbers for my Acer notebook but it’s good to know that Acer support will help me in the rare instance I do have  a problem with my Acer notebook computer.</p>

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3124" title="Cheapest Apple  Memory Upgrades" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Screen-Shot-2011-10-08-at-1.48.34-PM.png" alt="Best Prices on Mac RAM" width="311" height="321" /></a>First, I need to determine what you need to buy before I can help further. “Memory Sticks” could be considered RAM memory modules, or they also could be understood as USB drives  or sometimes known as flash sticks too.</p>

<p><strong>Cheap Memory From Amazon</strong></p>

<p>In this case, I am going to assume you need to buy cheap memory modules. There are many memory stores willing to help you with getting the right ram for your desktop or notebook computer, but I am finding of late that when shopping for RAM, one of the best places to buy memory upgrades or menory sticks, if you prefer – is from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">Amazon</a>.</p>

<p>Over the years, Amazon has grown from selling  not only books but also computers and computer memory too and often times the ram you buy at Amazon is cheaper than even if you were to buy it  from the memory anufacturer directly.</p>

<p>An example, would be 8GB RAM for notebook computers –  one of the best selling memory upgrades in 2012 thanks to the fact that most 2012 notebooks on sale come from the factory direct with 4GB of DDR3 ram, so to double the ram in your notebook computer, you will need to add another 4GB of RAM by buying two memory modules. Due to size and space limitations most notebooks come with just  two ram upgrade slots to install the RAM into, which leaves you to replace the RAM you already have installed with larger memory modules and this is in the form of an<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002YUF8ZG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399349&amp;creativeASIN=B002YUF8ZG"> 8GB DDR3 memory upgrade KIT.</a></p>

<p>If you compare the prices on DDR3 memory sticks, you will see that in most instances, it’s hard to beat the lowest price on RAM from Amazon:</p>

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p><strong>Update: Yes</strong></p>

<p>Now that 2012 versions of the Mac Mini, iMac and MacBook Pro have been released you can use DDR3 1600MHz memory upgrades. In fact, here’s the best prices:</p>

<p>[table id=15 /]</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Screen-Shot-2011-12-06-at-1.41.25-PM.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3603" title="15 inch MacBook Pro Deal" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Screen-Shot-2011-12-06-at-1.41.25-PM.png" alt="Apple MacBook Pro Deal" width="298" height="293" /></a>Not Yet.</p>

<p>At present, all currently shipping Apple computers use DDR3 1333MHz as the fastest ram available for Apple computers. In the upcoming months, this may change  as new Apple computers are released in 2012, but for the time being we’re stuck with 1333Mhz  as the fastest RAM you can install in any Apple computer model</p>

<p>MacBook Pro models use DDR3 sodimms with a maximum of either 8GB or 16GB of RAM, depending on who you ask. Officially, all the MacBook Pros max out at 8GB of DDR3  1333 Mhz memory, but since released in Feb 2011, 8GB DDR3 memory modules have become available for sale and with the  price  dropping, 16GB of RAM for MacBook Pro is starting to become affordable.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>iMacs can accept more ram than the MacBook Pros thanks to more real estate to work with, as four memory upgrade slots are available for upgrades. Like the MBP’s the iMacs officially max out at 16GB but some have reported on 32GB of iMac memory working just fine.</p>

<p>The Mac Mini is the smallest and cheapest Apple computer on sale today, but the same rules apply to the Mac Mini as it does with the MacBook Pro – 8GB max, so say the folks at Apple. One thing to note is that if you can swap out ram between the iMac/Mac Mini/MacBook Pros as they all use the exact same memory upgrade in a 1333Mhz DDR3 sodimm format.</p>

<p>Even the Apple Mac Pro is still limited to 1333Mhz RAM upgrades and like the other model above – you can have a maximum ram for Mac Pro of either 32GB or 64GB. The Mac Pro  is getting a bit old in 2012 so it’s not too surprising that 8GB DDR3 sodimms were not available on sale, resulting in a maximum of 32GB (4GB x 8 slots)</p>

<p>I have no doubt that in time we will see DDR3 1600 memory requirements for Apple computers, but for 2011 and into 2012 you are limited to using DDR3 10600 memory upgrades for Apple computers</p>

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>After all the feedback recently after verizon decided to charge their customers to pay their bills ( and then rescinded after all the feedback was rightfully negative for this idea) I realized that I had no idea on how to pay my verizon bill and not get charged a fee for giving Verizon my hard earned money and with this, it all changes as if there’s on priority I wan to make it’s better money management.</p>

<h2 id="verizon-bill-payment-options">Verizon Bill Payment Options</h2>

<p>In the interest of full disclosure, my soon to be wife takes care of all the Verizon bill payments in our family, and I am pretty sure she sends payment  via <a href="http://myverizon.com/billpay">bill payment online</a>, but there are other options to make sure  your Verizon bill is paid on time and without penalty.</p>

<p><a href="http://myverizon.com/billview"><strong>View Your Verizon Bill Online</strong></a></p>

<p>One of the first things you are going  to need to do if you want to pay your Verizon bill – regardless of how you end up paying it is to be able to view your  bill online. I am only  a Verizon wireless customer so far, but I know I can not only view my bill with verizon anytime, but at the end of the month I get a paper bill that’s sometimes many many pages long in the mail.</p>

<p><strong>Pay Your Verizon Bill Online</strong></p>

<p>Paying your Verizon Bill online is probably one of the easiest when it comes to methods to get your Verizon account  taken care of . All you have to do is Sign in at My Verizon and click on Account and then Payment and Payment Options to pay Verizon Online</p>

<p><strong>Paying your Verizon Bill By Mail</strong></p>

<p>Verizon will accept your bill payment via check. All you do is send your  payment to Verizon at the address on your Verizon bill. Be sure to include a stamp and send the correct amount so you don’t get charged late payment fees.</p>

<p><strong>Pay Verizon in Person</strong></p>

<p>You can also visit one of many many Verizon outlets and make a payment in person with cash, credit or debit card. All of these methods are acceptable to Verizon.</p>

<p>As you can see, there all lots of ways to get your Verizon Bill paid in time so you continue to use their services and your Verizon account will remain in good standing.</p>

<p>I have yet to succumb to the siren call that is the Apple iPad as frankly,  I don’t know I would have as much use for it. I find that my fancy new Verizon phone pretty much does all an iPad  would and yet is still small enough to fit  in my pocket.</p>

<p>But, I’m getting close to pull the trigger on some sort of tablet, and preferably an iPad  due to the tight integration of other Apple products I already own, so now that I am in the market for a tablet of some kind, where do I find a good deal on an Apple iPad in Canada?</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.apple.ca">Apple Canada</a> iPad Deals </strong></p>

<p>You won’t find much in the way of deals on an iPad here, but  you can get your iPad engraved  – something you cannot do at any other computer store that I am aware of in Canada. There’s also the satisfaction of knowing you bought your iPad directly from Apple instead of some third party.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.futureshop.ca">Future Shop </a>iPad Deals</strong></p>

<p>The iPad is rarely on sale here, but I have seen the odd  sale on iPads here – especially when new Apple iPads are released. A good time to buy an iPad 2 is when the upcoming and rumored Apple iPad 3 is released.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.bestbuy.ca">Best Buy</a></strong> iPad Deals</p>

<p>Like Future Shop,  it’s not very often to see a deal on a brand new iPad from this store either.</p>

<p>The best way to get an iPad Deal might be to either import an iPad from the USA, but then you have the hassle of customs brokerage and assosciated fees, so please do your homework on how much money you will really save if you buy your iPad from the USA.</p>

<p>One last suggestion: If you’re patient you may be able to get a good deal on a iPad at craigslist if you feel you can trust the vendor. The iPad is an expensive electronic  device that’s portable and can be dropped so be sure to do your due diligence on buying a used iPad from an unknown  source.</p>

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>I am moving to the USA soon and in preparation for this we (my fiance and  I) have started  to consider a Verizon family plan, as this plan will allow me to use my Verizon phone in Canada as long as I stay away from data usage, as the costs for using data with Verizon in Canada is one cost I prefer not to have.</p>

<p>She orders the phones, and what should have been a simple transaction  – we buy the verizon phones, and she may have to call Verizon  to get her old Verizon phone number and all I would have to do would be to actiivate my phone, and then have her bring it to me in Canada.</p>

<p>But, Verizon  screwed  this up big time. Apparently it was our fault too, but she just ordered the phone, plan and then thought all would be good. Nope.</p>

<p>She had to call Verizon to get this all straightened out but the first question we had to answer was whom to call at Verizon?</p>

<p><strong>Verizon Contact and Customer Service Numbers</strong></p>

<p>There a lot of ways to<a href="http://www.verizonwireless.com/b2c/contact/index.jsp"> Contact Verizon</a>, email – self serve options, faqs so you don’t even have to call them at all and  you can resolve your own issues, but in our case we had to** Call Verizon at (800) 922-0204** and even though we had to jump through some hoops to make it all work, we did.</p>

<p>We had to get transferred at Verizon customer support to speak to a more advanced customer service than the poor souls on the front line but we did get it all worked out, but it was a comedy of errors. The phones she ordered arrived, but in the meantime we found that we had to ship one back for her to keep her old phone number with Verizon.</p>

<p>Then, as these were newer and popular phones at the time her replacement phone was backordered so we had  to wait. Later when her phone finally did show up, so did another as somehow Verizon managed to ship her two phones – one to her work and one to her home address and after we finally got that sorted out then we were finally able to stop having to contact Verizon to fix our mess and thankfully we have not had to contact Verizon since.</p>

Truth be told, I have an old school 30GB iPod that holds more than enough music I care to listen  to, but it’s starting to get older and I am hoping to buy a new iPod – from Amazon probably as I find that they usually have the<strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/mn/search/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;x=0&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;y=0&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;field-keywords=ipod&amp;url=search-alias%3Daps"> best iPod prices</a></strong>, when you compare iPod prices from them as opposed to buying an iPod direct from Apple.</p>

<p>And this means I will want to get rid of my <a href="http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/ipod/specs/ipod-5th-generation-enhanced-specs.html">old iPod</a> to help pay for the newer model. I am thinking about buying an Apple iPod Touch to replace my much older 30GB model, and I want to be able to reset the 30GB iPod to the same as it was when you bought it back in 2006, almost six years old  now. Wow.</p>

<p>I found an <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1320">Apple help document</a>  that shows me how to reset my 30GB iPod but  also for others too, so I thought I would share this, as I thought surely there’s somebody else wanting to set their iPod to factory settings.</p>

<p>In my case, all I needed to do was was toggle the hold switch, which means  turning the hold switch on and off and then at the same time I held down the menu button and the center button and in about 7 seconds the iPod reset itself. Apple suggests doing all this with your iPod either plugged into a computer or wall outlet, so I made sure it had power before I went ahead with my iPod reset.</p>

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>As great as Apple Computer is, there are times when either the Mac OS operating system or the application itself doesn’t work as it should resulting in you having to stop what you’re doing  and deal with this troublesome application that doesn’t want to play nice with your Mac.</p>

<p><strong>How To Force Quit Mac Software. </strong></p>

<p>One of the most common indicators that something is wrong with your Apple is  when you’re left sitting there waiting for your software to respond, and then after a while you realize that even on the slowest Apple computer made today – something is wrong with your Mac.</p>

<p>Sometimes,  the Mac will display the indicator or spinwheel displaying that it’s trying to catch up, but don’t be fooled – that appllication is stuck, even if the wheel is spinning your Mac gave up the ghost long ago.</p>

<p>When you’re ready to force quit Mac software, all you have to do is:</p>

<p>From the Apple Menu in the top left hand corner of your screen** choose the force quit menu item. <strong>Alternately, you can use the keyboard and  hi</strong>t Command – Option – Escape** to exit the Mac Application too. Lastly, the third way to force quit is to right click on the Application icon in the dock and  choose force quit. All three get you to the same result:quitting  the Mac software.</p>

<p>I suggest two things to make sure you see less chances of even needing to force quit  Apple software: The first, is to be sure you have enough ram installed. ram is cheap and one reason your application keeps hanging is that you don’t have enough ram to run the software for your Mac in the first  place.</p>

<p>My last suggestion is to restart your Mac.This is an optional step and not  required, but I have found more times than not that a good reboot fixes a lot of computer problems.</p>

<p>If you find yourself needing to force quite your Mac a lot, you may want to take your Mac into see an Apple Genius, or contact Apple Support to be sure there’s not  a problem with your Mac that a force quit will not fix.</p>

		<div class="post-content"><p>Maybe it’s the old guy in me, and even though I have been working in online sales for over a decade I never really ordered that much stuff online and would prefer to go to the store in person to check stuff out and decide whether I ant to spend  my money on a product or service.</p>

<p>There’s lots of reasons why I prefer to shop in person, but one of the best reasons is you can sometimes get a better deal if you shop at the store as opposed to shopping online. I have found more deals by physically  being in the right place at the right time.</p>

<p>This old school style of shopping especially holds true to cellular phones too. Usually they are staffed by eager kids who can work the phones with one hand  in seconds, as opposed to my old  fingers trying to figure out how to transfer my contacts from my memory card or some other problem.</p>

<p>And speaking of problems, one problem you have to solve first is the fact that you need to know where to go. When shopping online, you either do a google search for what you want to buy, or a good  place to check is also from Amazon, as – and  this especially holds true in the  USA – chances are they will have i – <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">in stock and on sale</a></strong>.</p>

<p>When it comes to finding Verizon stores in my area, I have found it easiest  to ask the<a href="http://www.verizonwireless.com">** mother ship** </a>rather than do a google  search and  weed through the sites that can’t help you.</p>

<p>Verizon offers a handy dandy <a href="http://www.verizonwireless.com/b2c/storelocator/index.jsp" title="Verizon store locator">Verizon Store Locator</a> where all you have to do is enter either your  zip code, or start your search for the best Verizon location for you by choosing your state and then after you do that you pick your city. You will be presented with  a list of  the closes verizon stores and you get to choose the radius of your search  from 5 miles, 15 miles, 25miles, or 75miles, depending on how far you want to travel.</p>

<p>This is the easiest way to find the best and  Nearest Verizon Locations so that you can go in person for either Verizon sales or support.</p>
