   <B> <h1><a href="/2011/12/windows-notepad-mac-software-alternatives/">Windows NotePad. Mac Software Alternatives</a></h1></B>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content">I&#8217;m switching from Mac to PC.  I know that the usual consensus in the online community, especially in  the blogger community is to switch from PC to Mac and not the other way around,  but when I went shopping for a brand new notebook this fall I really couldn&#8217;t justify the cost of a brand new MacBook computer of any shape or size when you can buy a comparable **[Windows 7 notebook][1]** for considerably  less money.

I find that the work (and increasingly, my play time too)  I do with my computer is done in the cloud. I write in the cloud, check email in the cloud but there&#8217;s one area that I still use an application for and that&#8217;s a simple text editor. I don&#8217;t have a need for anything complicated and even Microsoft Office is too much.

On the PC the choice is notepad and it suits me just fine for simple text stuff. But what is the alternative text editor on the Mac?

**Mac NotePad Alternatives**

**[TextEdit ][2]**is the default text editor on the Mac, but when you compare it to** [Windows notepad][3]** it seems like it&#8217;s a bit of a letdown and really really simple. Almost too simple.

**[Google Docs][4]** is a free text editor that&#8217;s worth a look &#8211; and I can recommend  that as well. Not only can you edit text, but you have a full office suite with Google docs too. And the best part &#8211; it&#8217;s all free.

One thing I do miss the most about text editing software for the Mac is **[BBEdit][5]**. This software is one of the more robust text editors out there for the Mac and if you do any sort of programming, web or otherwise  &#8211; this software is definitely worth a look.

If free text editing software is what you need, the good folks at Barebones software &#8211; the same people that are the creators of  BBEdit also offer Text Wrangler,  and this free text editing  software far surpasses any text editor for Mac or PC.

If you need a cloud based text editor that allows you to edit your files no matter where you are &#8211; Google Docs is the clear winner. But, if you prefer an Apple Application, **[TextWrangler ][6]**is the best free text editing software for the Mac today.

   <B> <h1><a href="/2011/12/where-to-find-quicktime-download-software/">Where To Find QuickTime Download Software</a></h1></B>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content">One of the many issues I tend to have recently is that  in my move from Mac  to PC  &#8211; I know, I know &#8211;  but I just can&#8217;t find the money right now for a new 2012 MacBook Pro. RAM prices are not what they once were and in tough times, one has to cut costs. One way to do this is to buy a PC notebook instead of the Macs I am used  to as this switch to the dark side is much cheaper than buying a new Mac today.

Anyway, one are where the **Mac just works,** is with QuickTime software. When I would work on my Mac,  all I had to do would be to would  be to &#8211; just use my Mac, whereas the PC makes me stop and  think. Earlier today I had to stop what I was doing as QuickTime is not on my PC installed from the factory. This leaves me to have to stop and think** where can I find a QuickTime download**?

It  took me time to figure out if I really needed to install QuickTime, but then I figured I will need to download Quicktime eventually so I may as well do it while I am with an internet connection.

[**Download QuickTime 7**][1]

The download page directed me to the PC version, as I&#8217;m writing this on a PC and  at the  time of writing , version 7.7.1 is current for Windows XP, Windows Vista or Windows 7 users.

Apple does require my email address,  and I think that&#8217;s a fair trade &#8211; I&#8217;m a registered Apple user already so they have my information anyway.  I&#8217;m essentially just repeating myself here. I figure an email address for free software is a fair trade.

My QuickTime Download experience went smoothly and installed on my windows 7 machine and now I can  use any software that requires the use of QuickTime software for PC.

   <B> <h1><a href="/2011/12/mackeeper-review-911-for-your-mac/">MacKeeper Review: 911 For Your Mac</a></h1></B>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content">[<img class="size-full wp-image-3603 alignleft" title="15 inch MacBook Pro Deal" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Screen-Shot-2011-12-06-at-1.41.25-PM.png" alt="Apple MacBook Pro Deal" width="298" height="293" />][1]

I keep on seeing ads for this software everywhere  I turn, so I guess it&#8217;s about time I had a closer look to see what all the fuss is about. **[MacKeeper][2]**, as they call it &#8211; is 911 for you Mac, and the main features of this software for Apple computers &#8211;  both desktop and  notebooks &#8211;  is to keep your Mac running healthy and happy.

**Antivirus and Anti Theft Protection**

I&#8217;ve been running without antivirus protection on all my Apple computers for years, but they do happen and MacKeeper tends to be  offer protection against all security threats &#8211; not just viruses, but also identity theft, phishing attacks, unsafe downloads, email viruses and Mac Spyware and Mac malware is also blocked with MacKeeper.

The anti-theft feature won&#8217;t stop somebody from stealing your Mac, but it can help you identify the thief by reporting on the location of your stolen Mac and  even taking a picture of the thief by using the built in web camera.

**Robust Data Control**

Your data is probably the most important thing to you and usually has much more value than even the computer itself, and MacKeeper offer four components to keep your data safe:

  1. The data encrypter hides your important files and those wishing to view those files need a password to do so.
  2. Backups are so important. Your [hard drive could fail at any time][3] and you&#8217;d be left without a thing when your hard drive crashes. Don&#8217;t let this happen to you and use the MacKeeper backup component to make copies of your stuff on external hard drives, via FTP , USB drive or ZeoDisk.
  3.  File recovery lets you preview and recover deleted files. I know I have been trigger happy at times with the trash and would love to have had this tool in my arsenal.
  4. The shredder deletes files and folders you no longer need forever.

**Cleaning and Maintenance **

  1. Duplicates Finder removes, wait for it  &#8211; duplicate files. It costs money and space to keep two or more of every file.
  2. Fast Clean removes all the junk  on your Mac that accumulates over time
  3. Smart Installer is a much better method to remove applications on your Ma ensuring there&#8217;s no files and clutter and hidden files left behind.
  4. File finder allows you to quickly find the file you&#8217;re looking for with ease.

**Optimization**

  1. Updates happen automatically with the included Update Tracker software. Each version of software on your Mac is checked to be sure you are running the latest software.
  2. Login Items allow you to start some applications automatically which results in more time for you and less time  waiting for applications to load.
  3. Default Apps is a great way to choose an application to open a file with.

<div>
</div>

<div>
  <strong>Summary</strong>
</div>

<div>
  There&#8217;s  a grand total of sixteen different Mac Apps in the MacKeeper  suite designed to keep your Mac secure from threats and running smoothly, and with a price of just$38.00 for a limited time that includes a license  for 1 Mac, that works out to just pennies a day to keep your Mac safe and sound. If you have up to 2 macs, the price goes up to $58.95, and adding  third Mac gets you to $88.95.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  A free trial download of MacKeeper is available so you can fully test MacKeeper free of charge before you buy the software, and if you  do decide to buy MacKeeper you can get it activated instantly online  &#8211; you don&#8217;t  have to wait for the software to ship to you as you already have the software and are just unlocking MacKeeper to continue use past the 14 day trial period.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  For$38.00, this looks like a fair price to pay for a full featured utility for use with any Mac computer on sale today.

   <B> <h1><a href="/2011/12/how-to-print-screen-on-mac-computers/">How To Print Screen On Mac Computers</a></h1></B>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content">[<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3722" title="Cheap Acer notebook " src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Screen-Shot-2011-12-21-at-3.29.06-PM.png" alt="Best Price on Acer notebook" width="304" height="337" />][1]I&#8217;ve recently moved from Mac to Windows. I know, I know &#8211; how could I after all these years of tracking memory prices primarily for Apple computers? Well, this is probably an article for another day but I find that  the value offered by a Mac for my needs is no longer there. I&#8217;m typing this on a **[very well equipped cheap PC notebook][2]** and if it were not for a few minor things that I miss I would be hard pressed to tell the difference as I switched from Mac to PC notebook and saved $1600 along the way.

That said, one thing I really miss and it&#8217;s probably due to the fact I have worked with Apple computers for close to two decades now is how easy it was to print screen on a Mac:** Shift &#8211; Command &#8211; 3** and I would be done.  I used the print selection feature even more: **Shift Command 4 would get me just a selection of a page. **

Both of these simple commands would  save a screen shot to my desktop and I would then double click on the screen shot to print the image &#8211; in most cases by using the preview application.

**Print Screen on Windows Instead**

I have no idea how to do the same on a PC as easy &#8211; especially when it  comes to making a selection of the screen. I miss command shift 4 every day since switching from Mac to PC, and it may be one reason to switch back to the Mac OS at some point, but at the moment this cheap Acer notebook  is going to have to do the  trick for now. I know I can use the &#8216;snipping tool&#8217; in Windows 7 to make either a selection or screen grab of the entire screen, but this is far from perfect: you have to open up an entire other windows application to do so and then navigate menus to get the screen grab you want.

This is one example of how the **Mac offers a far superior print screen solution** than the more popular PC.

This isn&#8217;t something that the hard drive manufacturers like to talk about, but it really is common sense: Most hard drives in use today use moving parts and after a while, those parts stop moving due to use.  Hard Drives are sensitive electronics that don&#8217;t like to be jolted or moved, and despite the advances in solid state hard drives or even the technology in keeping standard old school hard drives free of damaging shock there may be a time when you need help with your hard drive

**Western Digital Hard Drive Help**

There&#8217;s more than one manufacturer of hard drives and names like Seagate, Buffalo and even memory manufacturers are now getting into the game when it  comes to solid state drives, but Western Digital might very well be the best selling hard drive manufacturer in 2012 and beyond.

I have been lucky to not experience a hard drive failure in recent  times, so I haven&#8217;t had to call or email Western Digital for support. I did have to contact LaCie once but that was due to the fact that I lost the cables associated with the drive in a move and had to order new cables for once was at a time a very large hard dive at 1TB.

But if you haven&#8217;t been so lucky and need help with your hard drive from Western Digital, you&#8217;re usually in luck as most hard drive failures tend to happen in the first few months if they&#8217;re going to fail and this will happen  well into the two year limited warranty that comes with each Western Digital Hard Drive.

To contact Western Digital your best bet is to visit the [western digital support page][2] where you can find answers to your hard drive support questions including dowloads, registration, warranty services, installation help as well as phone and email support too.

I hope you&#8217;ve been lucky as I have when it comes to hard drive failure, but if you do need help with your WD hard drive, the folks at Western Digital are happy to help

<br>

		<div class="post-content">There&#8217;s two things I love about the internet:

1. You can connect and interact with just about anybody and read and learn so much from each other.

2. You can shop online!

I have been shopping for notebook computer memory for close to 15 years now to help you guys get the [best deal on RAM][1], and buy it much cheaper than from other over priced stores. (see the sidebar to the right of this article for some real cheap ram).

And one of the cheapest computers on sale right now tend to be from [Acer computer][2]. Add some memory to these cheapo notebooks and you&#8217;ve got a [fast and cheap notebook computer for under $600][3].

Most all Acer notebooks come with a limited warranty, but usually once you&#8217;ve made your purchase the online store from which you bought your Acer won&#8217;t refund  your money and  this leaves you to have to contact Acer support in the rare case you do have a problem with your new Acer notebook.

**Acer  Contact Information**

To save you some time, here are the Acer Computer contact information:

[Acer USA][4]

[Acer Canada][5]

[Acer Brasil ][6]

[Acer Mexico][7]

[Acer Latin America][8]

There are also contact support for [Acer Europe and Acer Middle East and Asia Pacific ][9]too, but the Americas tend to be the most popular when it comes to Acer users so I&#8217;ll stop the list there.

Once you find the region you are in you will be able to contact Acer  by phone or email and have any warranty issues you need to be taken care of. I have found that in the past most companies are willing to work with you when it comes to notebook warranty if you treat them like you would like to be treated

As a new Acer notebook PC  user, I hope to never have to use these contact numbers for my Acer notebook but it&#8217;s good to know that Acer support will help me in the rare instance I do have  a problem with my Acer notebook computer.

<br>

		<div class="post-content">[<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3124" title="Cheapest Apple  Memory Upgrades" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Screen-Shot-2011-10-08-at-1.48.34-PM.png" alt="Best Prices on Mac RAM" width="311" height="321" />][1]First, I need to determine what you need to buy before I can help further. &#8220;Memory Sticks&#8221; could be considered RAM memory modules, or they also could be understood as USB drives  or sometimes known as flash sticks too.

**Cheap Memory From Amazon**

In this case, I am going to assume you need to buy cheap memory modules. There are many memory stores willing to help you with getting the right ram for your desktop or notebook computer, but I am finding of late that when shopping for RAM, one of the best places to buy memory upgrades or menory sticks, if you prefer &#8211; is from [Amazon][2].

Over the years, Amazon has grown from selling  not only books but also computers and computer memory too and often times the ram you buy at Amazon is cheaper than even if you were to buy it  from the memory anufacturer directly.

An example, would be 8GB RAM for notebook computers &#8211;  one of the best selling memory upgrades in 2012 thanks to the fact that most 2012 notebooks on sale come from the factory direct with 4GB of DDR3 ram, so to double the ram in your notebook computer, you will need to add another 4GB of RAM by buying two memory modules. Due to size and space limitations most notebooks come with just  two ram upgrade slots to install the RAM into, which leaves you to replace the RAM you already have installed with larger memory modules and this is in the form of an[ 8GB DDR3 memory upgrade KIT.][3]

If you compare the prices on DDR3 memory sticks, you will see that in most instances, it&#8217;s hard to beat the lowest price on RAM from Amazon:

<br>

		<div class="post-content">**Update: Yes**

Now that 2012 versions of the Mac Mini, iMac and MacBook Pro have been released you can use DDR3 1600MHz memory upgrades. In fact, here&#8217;s the best prices: 

[table id=15 /]

[<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3603" title="15 inch MacBook Pro Deal" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Screen-Shot-2011-12-06-at-1.41.25-PM.png" alt="Apple MacBook Pro Deal" width="298" height="293" />][1]Not Yet.

At present, all currently shipping Apple computers use DDR3 1333MHz as the fastest ram available for Apple computers. In the upcoming months, this may change  as new Apple computers are released in 2012, but for the time being we&#8217;re stuck with 1333Mhz  as the fastest RAM you can install in any Apple computer model

MacBook Pro models use DDR3 sodimms with a maximum of either 8GB or 16GB of RAM, depending on who you ask. Officially, all the MacBook Pros max out at 8GB of DDR3  1333 Mhz memory, but since released in Feb 2011, 8GB DDR3 memory modules have become available for sale and with the  price  dropping, 16GB of RAM for MacBook Pro is starting to become affordable.

&nbsp;

iMacs can accept more ram than the MacBook Pros thanks to more real estate to work with, as four memory upgrade slots are available for upgrades. Like the MBP&#8217;s the iMacs officially max out at 16GB but some have reported on 32GB of iMac memory working just fine.

The Mac Mini is the smallest and cheapest Apple computer on sale today, but the same rules apply to the Mac Mini as it does with the MacBook Pro &#8211; 8GB max, so say the folks at Apple. One thing to note is that if you can swap out ram between the iMac/Mac Mini/MacBook Pros as they all use the exact same memory upgrade in a 1333Mhz DDR3 sodimm format.

Even the Apple Mac Pro is still limited to 1333Mhz RAM upgrades and like the other model above &#8211; you can have a maximum ram for Mac Pro of either 32GB or 64GB. The Mac Pro  is getting a bit old in 2012 so it&#8217;s not too surprising that 8GB DDR3 sodimms were not available on sale, resulting in a maximum of 32GB (4GB x 8 slots)

I have no doubt that in time we will see DDR3 1600 memory requirements for Apple computers, but for 2011 and into 2012 you are limited to using DDR3 10600 memory upgrades for Apple computers

**DDR3 1333Mhz memory prices **

<br>

		<div class="post-content">After all the feedback recently after verizon decided to charge their customers to pay their bills ( and then rescinded after all the feedback was rightfully negative for this idea) I realized that I had no idea on how to pay my verizon bill and not get charged a fee for giving Verizon my hard earned money and with this, it all changes as if there&#8217;s on priority I wan to make it&#8217;s better money management.

## Verizon Bill Payment Options

In the interest of full disclosure, my soon to be wife takes care of all the Verizon bill payments in our family, and I am pretty sure she sends payment  via [bill payment online][1], but there are other options to make sure  your Verizon bill is paid on time and without penalty.

[**View Your Verizon Bill Online**][2]

One of the first things you are going  to need to do if you want to pay your Verizon bill &#8211; regardless of how you end up paying it is to be able to view your  bill online. I am only  a Verizon wireless customer so far, but I know I can not only view my bill with verizon anytime, but at the end of the month I get a paper bill that&#8217;s sometimes many many pages long in the mail.

**Pay Your Verizon Bill Online**

Paying your Verizon Bill online is probably one of the easiest when it comes to methods to get your Verizon account  taken care of . All you have to do is Sign in at My Verizon and click on Account and then Payment and Payment Options to pay Verizon Online

**Paying your Verizon Bill By Mail**

Verizon will accept your bill payment via check. All you do is send your  payment to Verizon at the address on your Verizon bill. Be sure to include a stamp and send the correct amount so you don&#8217;t get charged late payment fees.

**Pay Verizon in Person**

You can also visit one of many many Verizon outlets and make a payment in person with cash, credit or debit card. All of these methods are acceptable to Verizon.

As you can see, there all lots of ways to get your Verizon Bill paid in time so you continue to use their services and your Verizon account will remain in good standing.

I have yet to succumb to the siren call that is the Apple iPad as frankly,  I don&#8217;t know I would have as much use for it. I find that my fancy new Verizon phone pretty much does all an iPad  would and yet is still small enough to fit  in my pocket.

But, I&#8217;m getting close to pull the trigger on some sort of tablet, and preferably an iPad  due to the tight integration of other Apple products I already own, so now that I am in the market for a tablet of some kind, where do I find a good deal on an Apple iPad in Canada?

**[Apple Canada][1] iPad Deals **

You won&#8217;t find much in the way of deals on an iPad here, but  you can get your iPad engraved  &#8211; something you cannot do at any other computer store that I am aware of in Canada. There&#8217;s also the satisfaction of knowing you bought your iPad directly from Apple instead of some third party.

**[Future Shop ][2]iPad Deals**

The iPad is rarely on sale here, but I have seen the odd  sale on iPads here &#8211; especially when new Apple iPads are released. A good time to buy an iPad 2 is when the upcoming and rumored Apple iPad 3 is released.

**[Best Buy][3]** iPad Deals

Like Future Shop,  it&#8217;s not very often to see a deal on a brand new iPad from this store either.

The best way to get an iPad Deal might be to either import an iPad from the USA, but then you have the hassle of customs brokerage and assosciated fees, so please do your homework on how much money you will really save if you buy your iPad from the USA.

One last suggestion: If you&#8217;re patient you may be able to get a good deal on a iPad at craigslist if you feel you can trust the vendor. The iPad is an expensive electronic  device that&#8217;s portable and can be dropped so be sure to do your due diligence on buying a used iPad from an unknown  source.
