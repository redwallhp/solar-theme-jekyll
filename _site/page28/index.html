<p><strong>Cheap Memory From Amazon</strong></p>

<p>In this case, I am going to assume you need to buy cheap memory modules. There are many memory stores willing to help you with getting the right ram for your desktop or notebook computer, but I am finding of late that when shopping for RAM, one of the best places to buy memory upgrades or menory sticks, if you prefer – is from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">Amazon</a>.</p>

<p>Over the years, Amazon has grown from selling  not only books but also computers and computer memory too and often times the ram you buy at Amazon is cheaper than even if you were to buy it  from the memory anufacturer directly.</p>

<p>An example, would be 8GB RAM for notebook computers –  one of the best selling memory upgrades in 2012 thanks to the fact that most 2012 notebooks on sale come from the factory direct with 4GB of DDR3 ram, so to double the ram in your notebook computer, you will need to add another 4GB of RAM by buying two memory modules. Due to size and space limitations most notebooks come with just  two ram upgrade slots to install the RAM into, which leaves you to replace the RAM you already have installed with larger memory modules and this is in the form of an<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002YUF8ZG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399349&amp;creativeASIN=B002YUF8ZG"> 8GB DDR3 memory upgrade KIT.</a></p>

<p>If you compare the prices on DDR3 memory sticks, you will see that in most instances, it’s hard to beat the lowest price on RAM from Amazon:</p>

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p><strong>Update: Yes</strong></p>

<p>Now that 2012 versions of the Mac Mini, iMac and MacBook Pro have been released you can use DDR3 1600MHz memory upgrades. In fact, here’s the best prices:</p>

<p>[table id=15 /]</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Screen-Shot-2011-12-06-at-1.41.25-PM.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3603" title="15 inch MacBook Pro Deal" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Screen-Shot-2011-12-06-at-1.41.25-PM.png" alt="Apple MacBook Pro Deal" width="298" height="293" /></a>Not Yet.</p>

<p>At present, all currently shipping Apple computers use DDR3 1333MHz as the fastest ram available for Apple computers. In the upcoming months, this may change  as new Apple computers are released in 2012, but for the time being we’re stuck with 1333Mhz  as the fastest RAM you can install in any Apple computer model</p>

<p>MacBook Pro models use DDR3 sodimms with a maximum of either 8GB or 16GB of RAM, depending on who you ask. Officially, all the MacBook Pros max out at 8GB of DDR3  1333 Mhz memory, but since released in Feb 2011, 8GB DDR3 memory modules have become available for sale and with the  price  dropping, 16GB of RAM for MacBook Pro is starting to become affordable.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>iMacs can accept more ram than the MacBook Pros thanks to more real estate to work with, as four memory upgrade slots are available for upgrades. Like the MBP’s the iMacs officially max out at 16GB but some have reported on 32GB of iMac memory working just fine.</p>

<p>The Mac Mini is the smallest and cheapest Apple computer on sale today, but the same rules apply to the Mac Mini as it does with the MacBook Pro – 8GB max, so say the folks at Apple. One thing to note is that if you can swap out ram between the iMac/Mac Mini/MacBook Pros as they all use the exact same memory upgrade in a 1333Mhz DDR3 sodimm format.</p>

<p>Even the Apple Mac Pro is still limited to 1333Mhz RAM upgrades and like the other model above – you can have a maximum ram for Mac Pro of either 32GB or 64GB. The Mac Pro  is getting a bit old in 2012 so it’s not too surprising that 8GB DDR3 sodimms were not available on sale, resulting in a maximum of 32GB (4GB x 8 slots)</p>

<p>I have no doubt that in time we will see DDR3 1600 memory requirements for Apple computers, but for 2011 and into 2012 you are limited to using DDR3 10600 memory upgrades for Apple computers</p>

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>After all the feedback recently after verizon decided to charge their customers to pay their bills ( and then rescinded after all the feedback was rightfully negative for this idea) I realized that I had no idea on how to pay my verizon bill and not get charged a fee for giving Verizon my hard earned money and with this, it all changes as if there’s on priority I wan to make it’s better money management.</p>

<h2 id="verizon-bill-payment-options">Verizon Bill Payment Options</h2>

<p>In the interest of full disclosure, my soon to be wife takes care of all the Verizon bill payments in our family, and I am pretty sure she sends payment  via <a href="http://myverizon.com/billpay">bill payment online</a>, but there are other options to make sure  your Verizon bill is paid on time and without penalty.</p>

<p><a href="http://myverizon.com/billview"><strong>View Your Verizon Bill Online</strong></a></p>

<p>One of the first things you are going  to need to do if you want to pay your Verizon bill – regardless of how you end up paying it is to be able to view your  bill online. I am only  a Verizon wireless customer so far, but I know I can not only view my bill with verizon anytime, but at the end of the month I get a paper bill that’s sometimes many many pages long in the mail.</p>

<p><strong>Pay Your Verizon Bill Online</strong></p>

<p>Paying your Verizon Bill online is probably one of the easiest when it comes to methods to get your Verizon account  taken care of . All you have to do is Sign in at My Verizon and click on Account and then Payment and Payment Options to pay Verizon Online</p>

<p><strong>Paying your Verizon Bill By Mail</strong></p>

<p>Verizon will accept your bill payment via check. All you do is send your  payment to Verizon at the address on your Verizon bill. Be sure to include a stamp and send the correct amount so you don’t get charged late payment fees.</p>

<p><strong>Pay Verizon in Person</strong></p>

<p>You can also visit one of many many Verizon outlets and make a payment in person with cash, credit or debit card. All of these methods are acceptable to Verizon.</p>

<p>As you can see, there all lots of ways to get your Verizon Bill paid in time so you continue to use their services and your Verizon account will remain in good standing.</p>

<p>I have yet to succumb to the siren call that is the Apple iPad as frankly,  I don’t know I would have as much use for it. I find that my fancy new Verizon phone pretty much does all an iPad  would and yet is still small enough to fit  in my pocket.</p>

<p>But, I’m getting close to pull the trigger on some sort of tablet, and preferably an iPad  due to the tight integration of other Apple products I already own, so now that I am in the market for a tablet of some kind, where do I find a good deal on an Apple iPad in Canada?</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.apple.ca">Apple Canada</a> iPad Deals </strong></p>

<p>You won’t find much in the way of deals on an iPad here, but  you can get your iPad engraved  – something you cannot do at any other computer store that I am aware of in Canada. There’s also the satisfaction of knowing you bought your iPad directly from Apple instead of some third party.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.futureshop.ca">Future Shop </a>iPad Deals</strong></p>

<p>The iPad is rarely on sale here, but I have seen the odd  sale on iPads here – especially when new Apple iPads are released. A good time to buy an iPad 2 is when the upcoming and rumored Apple iPad 3 is released.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.bestbuy.ca">Best Buy</a></strong> iPad Deals</p>

<p>Like Future Shop,  it’s not very often to see a deal on a brand new iPad from this store either.</p>

<p>The best way to get an iPad Deal might be to either import an iPad from the USA, but then you have the hassle of customs brokerage and assosciated fees, so please do your homework on how much money you will really save if you buy your iPad from the USA.</p>

<p>One last suggestion: If you’re patient you may be able to get a good deal on a iPad at craigslist if you feel you can trust the vendor. The iPad is an expensive electronic  device that’s portable and can be dropped so be sure to do your due diligence on buying a used iPad from an unknown  source.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2011/11/what-is-the-verizon-customer-service-number/">What is the Verizon Customer Service Number?</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>I am moving to the USA soon and in preparation for this we (my fiance and  I) have started  to consider a Verizon family plan, as this plan will allow me to use my Verizon phone in Canada as long as I stay away from data usage, as the costs for using data with Verizon in Canada is one cost I prefer not to have.</p>

<p>She orders the phones, and what should have been a simple transaction  – we buy the verizon phones, and she may have to call Verizon  to get her old Verizon phone number and all I would have to do would be to actiivate my phone, and then have her bring it to me in Canada.</p>

<p>But, Verizon  screwed  this up big time. Apparently it was our fault too, but she just ordered the phone, plan and then thought all would be good. Nope.</p>

<p>She had to call Verizon to get this all straightened out but the first question we had to answer was whom to call at Verizon?</p>

<p><strong>Verizon Contact and Customer Service Numbers</strong></p>

<p>There a lot of ways to<a href="http://www.verizonwireless.com/b2c/contact/index.jsp"> Contact Verizon</a>, email – self serve options, faqs so you don’t even have to call them at all and  you can resolve your own issues, but in our case we had to** Call Verizon at (800) 922-0204** and even though we had to jump through some hoops to make it all work, we did.</p>

<p>We had to get transferred at Verizon customer support to speak to a more advanced customer service than the poor souls on the front line but we did get it all worked out, but it was a comedy of errors. The phones she ordered arrived, but in the meantime we found that we had to ship one back for her to keep her old phone number with Verizon.</p>

<p>Then, as these were newer and popular phones at the time her replacement phone was backordered so we had  to wait. Later when her phone finally did show up, so did another as somehow Verizon managed to ship her two phones – one to her work and one to her home address and after we finally got that sorted out then we were finally able to stop having to contact Verizon to fix our mess and thankfully we have not had to contact Verizon since.</p>

		<div class="post-content"><p>The <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/mn/search/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;x=0&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;y=0&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;field-keywords=ipod&amp;url=search-alias%3Daps">Apple iPod</a></strong> has been around for a while now and with that are different versions. Truth be told, I have an old school 30GB iPod that holds more than enough music I care to listen  to, but it’s starting to get older and I am hoping to buy a new iPod – from Amazon probably as I find that they usually have the<strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/mn/search/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;x=0&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;y=0&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;field-keywords=ipod&amp;url=search-alias%3Daps"> best iPod prices</a></strong>, when you compare iPod prices from them as opposed to buying an iPod direct from Apple.</p>

<p>And this means I will want to get rid of my <a href="http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/ipod/specs/ipod-5th-generation-enhanced-specs.html">old iPod</a> to help pay for the newer model. I am thinking about buying an Apple iPod Touch to replace my much older 30GB model, and I want to be able to reset the 30GB iPod to the same as it was when you bought it back in 2006, almost six years old  now. Wow.</p>

<p>I found an <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1320">Apple help document</a>  that shows me how to reset my 30GB iPod but  also for others too, so I thought I would share this, as I thought surely there’s somebody else wanting to set their iPod to factory settings.</p>

<p>In my case, all I needed to do was was toggle the hold switch, which means  turning the hold switch on and off and then at the same time I held down the menu button and the center button and in about 7 seconds the iPod reset itself. Apple suggests doing all this with your iPod either plugged into a computer or wall outlet, so I made sure it had power before I went ahead with my iPod reset.</p>

<p>When I was done,  I had a like new 30GB iPod on sale and with the money I got, (not much – well under $100) I could use that money to<strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FA1O0O/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001FA1O0O"> buy my new Apple iPod Touch</a></strong></p>

    <h1><a href="/2011/11/how-to-force-quit-mac-applications-that-dont-respond/">How To Force Quit Mac Applications That Don&#8217;t Respond</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>As great as Apple Computer is, there are times when either the Mac OS operating system or the application itself doesn’t work as it should resulting in you having to stop what you’re doing  and deal with this troublesome application that doesn’t want to play nice with your Mac.</p>

<p><strong>How To Force Quit Mac Software. </strong></p>

<p>One of the most common indicators that something is wrong with your Apple is  when you’re left sitting there waiting for your software to respond, and then after a while you realize that even on the slowest Apple computer made today – something is wrong with your Mac.</p>

<p>Sometimes,  the Mac will display the indicator or spinwheel displaying that it’s trying to catch up, but don’t be fooled – that appllication is stuck, even if the wheel is spinning your Mac gave up the ghost long ago.</p>

<p>When you’re ready to force quit Mac software, all you have to do is:</p>

<p>From the Apple Menu in the top left hand corner of your screen** choose the force quit menu item. <strong>Alternately, you can use the keyboard and  hi</strong>t Command – Option – Escape** to exit the Mac Application too. Lastly, the third way to force quit is to right click on the Application icon in the dock and  choose force quit. All three get you to the same result:quitting  the Mac software.</p>

<p>I suggest two things to make sure you see less chances of even needing to force quit  Apple software: The first, is to be sure you have enough ram installed. ram is cheap and one reason your application keeps hanging is that you don’t have enough ram to run the software for your Mac in the first  place.</p>

<p>My last suggestion is to restart your Mac.This is an optional step and not  required, but I have found more times than not that a good reboot fixes a lot of computer problems.</p>

<p>If you find yourself needing to force quite your Mac a lot, you may want to take your Mac into see an Apple Genius, or contact Apple Support to be sure there’s not  a problem with your Mac that a force quit will not fix.</p>

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>Maybe it’s the old guy in me, and even though I have been working in online sales for over a decade I never really ordered that much stuff online and would prefer to go to the store in person to check stuff out and decide whether I ant to spend  my money on a product or service.</p>

<p>There’s lots of reasons why I prefer to shop in person, but one of the best reasons is you can sometimes get a better deal if you shop at the store as opposed to shopping online. I have found more deals by physically  being in the right place at the right time.</p>

<p>This old school style of shopping especially holds true to cellular phones too. Usually they are staffed by eager kids who can work the phones with one hand  in seconds, as opposed to my old  fingers trying to figure out how to transfer my contacts from my memory card or some other problem.</p>

<p>And speaking of problems, one problem you have to solve first is the fact that you need to know where to go. When shopping online, you either do a google search for what you want to buy, or a good  place to check is also from Amazon, as – and  this especially holds true in the  USA – chances are they will have i – <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">in stock and on sale</a></strong>.</p>

<p>When it comes to finding Verizon stores in my area, I have found it easiest  to ask the<a href="http://www.verizonwireless.com">** mother ship** </a>rather than do a google  search and  weed through the sites that can’t help you.</p>

<p>Verizon offers a handy dandy <a href="http://www.verizonwireless.com/b2c/storelocator/index.jsp" title="Verizon store locator">Verizon Store Locator</a> where all you have to do is enter either your  zip code, or start your search for the best Verizon location for you by choosing your state and then after you do that you pick your city. You will be presented with  a list of  the closes verizon stores and you get to choose the radius of your search  from 5 miles, 15 miles, 25miles, or 75miles, depending on how far you want to travel.</p>

<p>This is the easiest way to find the best and  Nearest Verizon Locations so that you can go in person for either Verizon sales or support.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2011/11/exploring-insurance-options-with-zander-insurance/">Exploring Insurance Options With Zander Insurance</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>I’m about to get married in the new year, and move to the USA from Canada, and if there’s one area I have no idea when it  comes to living in the USA , it’s about insurance or banking and I find that the best way I learn is to write as I go so here I am today – exploring the Zander  Insurance Group.</p>

<p><strong>Dave Ramsey Endorsed</strong></p>

<p>The very first thing I noticed when visiting Zander  is that Dave Ramsey  is all over this site, so either this is his own company or just one he endorses, there’s a lot of  goodwill from Dave (<a href="http://www.zanderins.com/about/about.aspx">further reading </a>shows that Dave just endorses the company and  that this insurance company has been around some time – since the 1920’s)</p>

<p><strong>Zander Term Life Insurance. </strong></p>

<p>Zander claims to have 80 years experience with Term Life Insurance, and they recognize how important Term Life Insurance is to a family’s future. You can get an  instant quote for Zander Term Inssurance and find out how cheap Term Life Insurance can be.</p>

<p><strong>Zander Disability Insurance</strong></p>

<p>Health is so important. It beats fancy cars,  iPads, the latest cell phones or even memory upgrades. If you’re not happy and healthy than it doesn’t matter how rich you are and with Zander Disability Insurance you can get covered in the case that you do become ill? I know this will be something I will look into further as I am not getting any younger, and although my job of sitting at the computer is hardly taxing  (boring sometimes) I could get hurt – either on the job or at home and I should  be sure I am covered in case that happens.</p>

<p><strong>Zander Identity Theft Insurance</strong></p>

<p>To be honest, I don’t really think too much about Identity theft, I mean am not a celebrity by any means,  and there’s lots of other Identities I could think of swiping other than my own, But, this is another type of insurance  I should  consider  too, as I am sure it’s the  world’s biggest pain  to get your identity back and Zander would keep  me insured from this event happening</p>

<p><strong>Zander Auto Insurance</strong></p>

<p>I don’t have a car to drive right now, but as I will be moving from the big city to the suburbs, I may need a car in the near future and it looks like Zander insurance may just be what I am looking for when it comes to car  insurance. Sure, there are much bigger car insurance companies out  there, but I can get a free quote on Car insurance quickly and easily using their online insurance quote form.</p>

<p>Financial Guru Dave Ramsey endorses this insurance company fully, so it will definitely be on my shortlist when it comes time to start insurance shopping in the USA.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2011/11/kingston-memory-vs-crucial-memory-which-memory-brand-is-best/">Kingston Memory vs Crucial Memory: Which Memory Brand is Best?</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>When I started ramseeker, the computer ram I compared the most was generic  memory and not RAM from brand name memory  like <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">Crucial</a> or <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/kingston">Kingston Memory</a>  as ram for both desktop and notebook computers was so expensive that it made no sense to install brand name memory in your PC or Mac when the generic memory would work just  as well.</p>

<div style="float: right; margin-right: 5px;">
</div>

<p><strong> Then, RAM Prices Dropped</strong></p>

<p>And all of sudden you could consider buying brand name ram from manaufacturers that no only sell the memory but make it too. I like to think that even though all the memory stores on ramseeker are on the up and up, buying name brand ram for you  computer just feels, well a little more secure.</p>

<p>It used to be that the brand name memory from Crucial was very expensive – in part due to the fact that they advertised heavily to create a brand. Crucial has only been around since the early 90’s. Compared to other industries, the RAM business is quite young.</p>

<p>Both of the memory brands –  Kingston or Crucial offer something generic sellers really can’t compete with and that’s customer support and warranty. Because these two brands make their own memory upgrades it’s easier for them to support the memory in the rare case of a problem with the RAM upgrade.</p>

<p>Asking which memory brand is better is kind of like asking the chicken or egg question. There’s no right answer. This i  ford versus chevy, or republican vs democrat – you’ll tend to favor one brand over the other. I have found that Crucial memory to be a little easier to buy online than Kingston but this is changing too as both Kingston Memory and Crucial Memory are on sale and a fraction of the price they were just one year ago.</p>

<p><strong>One More Brand</strong></p>

<p>Another memory brand you should consider when you’re ready to buy memory is <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/corsair">Corsair</a> memory. These folks used to charge an arm and a leg for RAM, but now tend to be one of the <strong>cheaper memory brands you can buy today</strong>.</p>
