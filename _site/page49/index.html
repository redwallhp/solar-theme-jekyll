<p>Now that it’s 2012,  it’s pretty easy to say that the minimum memory for today’s Apple Macintosh computers when it comes to <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="mac memory">Mac Memory</a> is 4GB of RAM. I could be wrong but I know the new MacBooks ship with 2gb of RAM standard and I’m pretty sure that the Mac Mini’s do too and the MacBook Pros start at 4gb of RAM and the Mac Pros can be filled with 64gb of ram if you’ve got deep enough pockets.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001265GI2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001265GI2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1300" title="Cheap 4GB Mac RAM" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-3.03.21-PM.png" alt="Cheap RAM for Macs 4GB" width="272" height="313" /></a></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001265GI2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001265GI2">Cheap 4GB RAM for Mac</a></strong></p>

<p>All this to say if you’re shopping for a memory upgrade for a new MacBook or Macbook Pro or, yes even Mac Mini – that you should have your sights on at very least 4GB of RAM for these Macs.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/iMac_KITS_(DDR3_1333)/" title="imac 16gb ram kits">The iMac will accept up to 16gb of RAM</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/Mac_Mini_KITS_(1066_DDR3)/" title="Mac mini memory upgrade kits">The Mac Mini will accept up to 8GB of RAM </a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_KITS_(1066_DDR3)/" title="macbook memory kits 4gb">The MacBooks will accept up to 4GB of RAM </a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_Pro_KITS_(1066_DDR3)/" title="macbook pro ram kits">The MacBook Pros will take up to 8GB</a> *(and  my guess is 16gb for MacBook Pros at next refresh). *</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/Mac_Pro_RAM_Upgrade_Kits_DDR3_1333_with_8GB_RAM/" title="Mac Pros 64gb memory">The Mac Pros will take up to 64GB. </a></p>

<p>But with it being back to school season, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26x%3D0%26ref_%3Dnb_sb_noss%26fsc%3D4%26ih%3D4_1_1_1_0_0_1_0_0_2.7_96%26y%3D0%26field-keywords%3Dmacbook%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957" title="buying a macbook">buying a MacBook</a> is going to be a popular activity over the next month or thereabouts so I want to talk about MacBook Memory as this is probably the  one computer form Apple that could really benefit from a 4gb Mac Memory Upgrade.</p>

<p>At 2gb stanard, Apple had to cut corners somewhere to get the MacBook to the Magical $999 price so they tossed 2x1Gb chips in it and said good enough..  (which I think is still a lot for what it is, but that’s a topic for another day). 4gb for MacBook  will turn your MB into a much more useable machine and 4gb is no money these days and the result of hte macbook ram upgrade will be making it more capable and it doesn’t matter what you’re doing with it surfing, email and so on will run faster and smoother with more memory for your portable mac.</p>

<p>If you’re running a Mac with 2GB or less and it’s a newer modern machine you should stop what you’re doing right now and see if you can get 4gb of RAM into your Mac somehow.</p>

<p>If you can’t add 4GB of RAM you might be better off buying a new Mac that allows 4gb.</p>

<p>4GB of RAM for all Macs released in 2010 should be the minimum amount in my opinion.</p>

<p>Installing Memory in a MacBook Pro (or macbook) is pretty easy and can be don by the average computer user without any special tools or know-how.</p>

<p>First, you need to buy new macbook pro RAM  to install (see current prices on MacBook Pro Memory above) and replace the standard MacBook Pro memory that came installed with your computer in the first place. **Add as much macbook pro ram as you can afford. **You can never never go wrong when shopping for macbook pro ram when you buy ram from my list of authorized <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="macbook pro stores">macbook pro stores</a>. Brand can matter for some people when it comes to shopping for MacBook Pro RAM as there’s a small chance that the brand name stuff will work a bit better  in your MacBook Pro as usually it’s been tested and guaranteed to work. Generic MacBook Pro RAM works just fine too but you might be buying a wee bit more peace of mind when you buy the name brand ram. The cheapest RAM may or may not be the the best price on MacBook Pro RAM.</p>

<p>[table id=1 /]</p>

<p>Once you have the RAM in your hand, you might want to invest in an anti-static wrist band. Sometimes you can buy the anti-static wrist band at the same time as you buy the MacBook Pro RAM, but  sometimes you’ll have to go elsewhere to buy an antistatic wrist band for installing memory. Your local computer store can usually help you.</p>

<p>You don’t NEED an antistatic wrist band if you’re sure to discharge any static electricity you have on you by touching  the metal casing of  your macbook pro first to discharge any static before you install the macbook pro ram. Also, it’s probably not a good idea to wear wool sweaters on a dry winter day or rub balloons on your head just before you install the macbook pro memory.  Be sure to discharge any static electricity before you go about installing RAM yourself. RAM is very particular and can be damaged by static electricity. When you bought it, you should have received it in an anti-static bag and sometimes there’s a big warning sticker on the bag that you have to break before you can access the ram and it says the same thing I’ve been saying: <strong>static electricity is bad for ram</strong></p>

<p>Once you’re all set to go then all you do is  remove the battery of your macbook pro, take  of the bottom part, or sometimes even then entire bottom. You might need a very small philips screwdriver or sometimes a specific torx screwdriver to do this. On my MacBook Pro, to add more ram once I had the cover off, I had to unplug and remove the MacBook Pro hard drive before I could access the RAM slots.</p>

<p>Once there, there’s two slots for MacBook Pro RAM and to remove the old MacBook Pro memory there’s two tabs that hold down the ram and when I did this the memory popped up to a 45 degree angle  which allowed me take hold of the memory (watch that static!) and with a slight pull I removed the memory. I did the same thing when removing the ram from the second memory slot and in no time I was ready to install my new MacBook Pro RAM.</p>

<p>For the actual installation of memory on my MacBook Pro all I did was the reverse. You slip the memory in at about a 45 degree angle into the slots and seat the memory into the slot. It’s a tight fit sometimes so don’t be afraid to use some gentle pressure. Push down on the RAM once it’s seated and the two little tabs click in to lock the memory down into the macbook pro’s memory slots. Repeat for the second memory slot in the MacBook Pro and you can’t go wrong really. The RAM has a little notch in it so you can’t install the memory backwards or upside down. The RAM only fits into the slot one way.</p>

<p>When you have your MacBook Pro ram installed,  all you do is replace what you removed to get at the memory upgrades slots. replace the hard drive, screw the cover or bottom of the MacBook Pro back on and replace the MacBook Pro Battery.  Press the power button and your MacBook Pro should start up without any trouble and now the MacBook Pro will run faster too and allow you to get your work done quicker.</p>

<p>Apple has excellent instructions on <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="how to install macbook pro ram">how to install MacBook Pro RAM </a> and you can find them by <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1270" title="install macbook pro ram">clicking here</a>. They’ve got instructions for a whole range of MacBook Pros so I suggest you refer to their instructions before installing MacBook Pro memory on your own.</p>

<p><strong>Where to Buy 8GB of RAM</strong></p>

<p>If you’re shopping online for 8GB of RAM there are loads of memory shops, stores,vendors whatever you wan to call them that will be more than happy to sell you 8GB of RAM.</p>

<p>But you should do your homework first. You might think it’s the best idea to shop for the lowest priced RAM but sometimes, not always – this is not the best way to buy ram as yes, price is king for RAM or anything else but memory is pretty advanced stuff. It’s not like  you’re buying a cup of coffee here. You’re buying what was once thought of impossible:8GB of memory for a very competitive price regardless of you who you end up buying RAM from and it wouldn’t hurt you to do some smart shopping and buy RAM from someobody who knows the business and what RAM you need for your computer.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW"><img title="Best Price 8GB MacBook Pro" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-3.09.11-PM.png" alt="Cheapest MacBook Pro 8GB" width="309" height="214" /></a></strong></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW">8GB MacBook Pro RAM</a></strong></p>

<p> </p>

<p>There are thousands and thousands of different computer models out there and each and every one  of them could benefit from a memory upgrade but some won’t even accept the 8GB  memory so that’s the first thing you need to know: How much RAM can your computer handle?</p>

<p>Next, will your OS recognize  the RAM. If you’re running an older version of windows or even the latest windows 7 be sure to check and be sure you can use and benefit from an 8GB RAM upgrade as you’re just throwing your money away if your computer won’t acknowledge the memory upgrade in the first place.</p>

<p>Once you’ve got those two things solved, you need to decide on  what’s important to you when shopping for RAM. Are you on a budget and the only way  you can  upgrade your memory is if you buy the cheapest RAM, or do you have a few more dollars to spend on brand name ram vs generic ram. Brand name RAM might be no better than generic, but for some it’s important to know that their memory came from a specific supplier as opposed to some that are nothing more than ram resellers.</p>

<p>How about customer service?  If you’re a programmer or IT specialist or even just an advanced hobbyist than you probably know your way around a memory upgrade and you probably have a favorite place to buy ram already and don’t care about customer service.</p>

<p>But if you’re new to computers and wouldn’t mind a bit of help with the memory upgrades both in the pre-sale and after sale  support you might be better off buying your 8GB RAM from somebody who offers the support you need.</p>

<p>Now that we have all our options and preferences when it comes to buying ram online (or even in store) we can go shopping for 8GB RAM. I suggest you buy 8GB of RAM from the following memory vendors:</p>

<p>Crucial Technology</p>

<p>18004Memory</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memoryx">Memory X </a></p>

<p>OEMPCWORLD</p>

<p>RAMJET</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memorytogo">Memory To Go </a></p>

<p>Other World Computing</p>

<p>These memory suppliers, or stores have been in business for over ten years, some closer to twenty and all will support you both in offering the best price on 8GB of RAM regardless of whether you are shopping for ram for Apple, Dell, HP or Sony Computers to name a few, the above listed memory sellers will help you get the right 8GB ram for the best price.</p>

<p>Good luck shopping for<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="8GB RAM Memory"> 8GB of RAM Memory</a></p>

<p>Unfortunately you cannot upgrade a MacBook to 8GB of RAM or Memory. <strong>Yet</strong>.</p>

<p>To get 8GB into an Apple notebook you’ll need to be working with a MacBook Pro as one of the advantages is that the MacBook Pro models can accept and recognize more  RAM than the lesser MacBooks and that’s just one of the few differnces when you compare the two macbook lines from Apple</p>

<p>The good news (and we’re talking about 2010 MacBook and MacBook Pros here is that you can  upgrade your MacBook to 4GB – and for the market the MacBook is aimed at (ie: consumer and educational market) 4GB of RAM is more than enough RAM for your MacBook. If you need 8GB of RAM than consider the MacBook Pro 13 inch if you want to fill a MacBook with 8GB of RAM.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW"><img title="Best Price 8GB MacBook Pro" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-3.09.11-PM.png" alt="Cheapest MacBook Pro 8GB" width="309" height="214" /></a></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW">Best Apple MacBook Pro 8GB RAM</a></strong></p>

<p>But forget about 8GB for MacBook Pros for  a second as we’re going to assume you have a MacBook or are considering buying a MacBook and regardless: you need more RAM for your MacBook.</p>

<p>The good news is 4GB MacBook RAM is much cheaper than 8GB of MacBook Pro RAM anyway so do yourself a favor and upgrade your MacBook and sell the original RAM that came with your MacBook back  to the memory stores. I know that OEMPCWORLD and RAMJET are just two memory stores that will buy your memory back from you. This is one way to offset the cost of your MacBook RAM upgrade even more as now you can upgrade your MacBook for even less. Currently a 4GB memory upgrade kit for MacBook  is priced under $100 whereas 8GB for MacBook Pros run a little under $300 still. If you managed to sell your old MacBook Memory you’re well under $100 for a MacBook that’s maxed out with memory. Don’t go out one night, eat at home instead  (I like pizza) and you’ll have saved enough money to upgrade your MacBook to the maximum 4GB of RAM.</p>

<p>If you have an older MacBook you can still get at very least 2GB of ram into your older MacBook for example a black macbook from circa 2006 or so is still a very useable and viable computer and and upgrade to 2gb costs about the same as a night at the movies so it’s my opinion it would be silly not to upgrade your macbook, regardless of when you bought it or what year it is.</p>

<p>For MacBook RAM prices I list  <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_KITS_(1066_DDR3)-4gb/" title="macbook 4gb memory kits">4gb macbook  upgrade kits</a> for newer models of MacBooks and if you have an older version of the Macbook you’re best off to upgrade with <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_(PC5300_DDR_KITS)-2gb/" title="macbook 2gb pc5300 memory upgrade kits">2GB MacBook PC5300 DDR memory upgrade kits.</a></p>

<p>I thought I’d take a minute or so and go over some MacBook Pro Memory upgrade options as Apple has this habit of calling every Pro MacBook they’ve released over the years MacBook Pro. Matte Screen, Glossy Screen, Santa Rosa, i3, i5, i7, Intel Core 2 Processors the list goes on and on.</p>

<p>If you’re buying a new MacBook Pro 13 inch, 15 inch, or 17 inch doesn’t matter. They all take the same RAM or Memory and that’s 1066 DDR3 sodimms. You can buy the ram from the Apple store (if you’ve got money to burn) or you can buy it from reputable third party vendors that you can trust such as: RAMJET, OWC, 18004Memory, MemoryX, OEMPCWORLD and Memory To Go. All these online memory stores know all about MacBook Pros  and what RAM goes where.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I"><img title="Cheapest Apple MacBook Pro" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-3.05.45-PM.png" alt="Best MacBook Pro Prices" width="294" height="209" /></a></p>

<p>I’ve made a handy dandy little list of <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_Pro_(1066_DDR3)/" title="macbook pro 1066 ddr3">MacBook Pro DDR3 1066 RAM Prices</a> and also, <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_Pro_KITS_(1066_DDR3)/" title="macbook pro memory upgrade kits">MacBook Pro DDR3 1066 Memory Upgrade Kits</a>. I suggest you check out both pages to get the<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="best ram deal"> best deal on ram</a> for a new (or new-ish) MacBook Pro.</p>

<p>For the older MacBook Pros you’ll need <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_Pro_(PC5300_DDR)/" title="macbook pro pc5300 ddr">PC5300 DDR2 SDRAM sodimms</a>. This sounds like a mouthful of  technical jargon and it is but if you’ve got an older MacBook Pro  (older than  two years old) than there’s a good chance you need the PC5300 DDR MacBook Pro RAM as opposed to the newer 1066MHz  MacBook Pro RAM.</p>

<p>And, again I happen to have a handy list of all the memory stores you can buy MacBook Pro RAM from for both <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_Pro_(PC5300_DDR_KITS)/" title="macbook pro pc5300 ddr memory upgrade kits">MacBook Pro PC5300 DDR memory upgrade kits </a>and MacBook  Pro PC5300 DDR modules priced individually.</p>

<p>Why the difference between the modules and the memory upgrade kits? Because over time I have found some stores list all their memory upgrades as memory modules yet others chose to market their ram upgrades as kits. You need to upgrade MacBook Pro RAM 2 at a time anyway (or at least, it’s recommended to do so) so it makes sense to sell the MacBook Pro RAM in matched pairs.</p>

<p>If you have no idea what RAM for the MacBook Pro you should be shopping for one quick and easy way is  to go to the Apple Menu in the top left corner of your screen (we’re assuming you’re on your macbook now) and select about your Mac. You’ll get information about your processor and memory at the same time and from there it’s easy to see as Apple tells you what ram speed you’re running and what type – exactly what you need to figure out what RAM is best for your specific MacBook Pro model.</p>

<p>Here’s my MacBook info as an example:</p>

<p>I have been monitoring memory prices for iMac since the very beginning with the very first  iMac ever released and I have come to realize that this very popular computer continues to offer the best bang for your dollar when shopping for an Apple desktop computer. And the value increases tremondously if you add more RAM to your Apple iMac – especially if you choose to maximize the amount of Memory installed in  your computer.</p>

<p>When deciding on the best memory upgrade size to install in new computers, or iMacs rather,  our friends at Apple are most concerned with installing the bare minimum of RAM so that the Mac OS will load on the iMac and maybe an application will run – something like Apple’s Mail program or Safari the Apple web browser.</p>

<p>But what if  you want  to get the most performance out of your iMac? You add more memory. Memory for the Apple iMacs have dropped in price considerably especially for the larger 8gb and now 16GB memory upgrade kits. When the 4GB DDR3 1066Mhz memory for Apple iMacs first came on the scene you’d be digging deep deep deep into your pockets and you’d not be suprised to pay almost what the Apple iMac costs but just in adding new RAM or Memory. 4GB RAM was priced at almost $500 per memory module.</p>

<p>Thankfully with any new technology ram prices keep on dropping over time and now you can <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="buy 4gb ddr3 memory">buy 4GB DDR3 for much less</a> yet still get the benefit of maximum performance that a maxed out iMac can provide you.</p>

<p>And now with the newer and latest iMacs you can even expand the RAM to a whopping 16GB on the new and current Apple iMacs with intel i3, i5 and i7 processors. Just a few memory stores supply ram for the 2010 Apple iMacs but over time you can bet more and more will come online and start to supply ram for the 2010 Apple iMacs. So far, I know Crucial Technology, OWC, RAMJET and DMS stock and carry RAM for the new Apple iMacs that require the 1333MHz RAM upgrades.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/iMac_KITS_(DDR3_1333)-16gb/" title="16gb apple iMac 2010">16GB for Apple iMac 2010</a> models is still a little pricey but if you make your living with your Apple iMac the price is not even a consideration really as your time is worth much more than any upgrade memory price and you should be able to recoup the investment in no time with your new iMac working away at maximum capacity.</p>

<p>You will not regret an iMac 2010 memory upgrade, regardless of cost.</p>

<p><strong>How much RAM do I need?</strong></p>

<p>DDR3 notebook memory in the 8GB configuration is the standard and most popular RAM upgrade in 2011:<br />

<p>If there’s a question I get asked it’s this: <strong>How much memory should I buy?</strong> And my answer always is: <strong>buy as much memory as you can afford</strong>. Obviously for some computer models buying a whole lot of ram is just extremely cost prohibititive – especially for high end desktop models like the new Apple Mac Pro. At the time I write this up, it will almost cost you $3000 to max out  the new <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/Mac_Pro_RAM_Upgrade_Kits_DDR3_1333_with_8GB_RAM/" title="mac pro max out ram">Mac Pro to 64GB of RAM</a>.  I know,  that’s pretty expensive ram upgrades, but this is an exception and not a rule. This is new memory for a new computer model and ram prices historically have dropped over time.</p>

<p>But for consumer systems and especially notebook computer upgrades, my advice is to max out the memory with as much as possible and then forget about it until you’re ready to upgrade to your next computer. For the most part, RAM doesn’t go bad (there’s exceptions) but if you buy memory from reputable companies that sell ram usually you install the memory and you’re done. And you get years of enjoyment out of your computer. You paid top dollar for your computer so it only makes the most sense to get the maximum performance out of it.</p>

<p>Desktop applications might be a bit different as there’s many memory slots (at least 4) for most desktop computers and then you’ll have to do some thought and research. You might still benefit from filling your desktop with ram as it’s one of the easiest ways to get top performance out of your home or office computer. With more and more consumers interested in hobbies such as digital photography and video editing these new breed of computer users could indeed benefit from a RAM upgrade as these are applciations that thrive on lots of memory.</p>

<p>This is just a quide but for 2010 4GB of RAM is the new low ram upgrade and most computers start with a base of at least this amount and sometimes even more. But 4GB is a good start.  If you don’t have 4GB of RAM find out how much ram you currently have and see if you can upgrade to 4GB. If not, you might want to consider a new computer, but I recommend 4GB, but machines that max out at 2GB are still useable too. Most netbooks made ship with just 1GB as standard RAM but for notebook computers look for 2GB or more, but 4GB of RAM is where the sweet spot is in <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="ram upgrades today">ram upgrades today</a></p>

		<div class="post-content"><p>To date, I’ve written a lot about Apple Memory as I’m drinking the Apple kool aid and never could get my mind around the windows thing, although lots have and this is not to fault them. This is not a Mac vs PC rant . Whatever works for you, works.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004K1EQO6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004K1EQO6">Cheapest Dell NoteBook</a></strong></p>

<p>[table id=7 /]</p>

<p>Right, memory. Regardless of what hardware you have such as HP Dell Apple and Sony to name a few computer manufacturers you’ll do yourself a big favor if you upgrade the ram and memory in your computer. RAM allows your OS to breath if you will. Rather than have to access data from your hard drive, which is slower – RAM can be bought and installed in your dell computer which will allow the often needed data to be stored and accessed quickly and when needed.</p>

<p>Let’s help you get the right memory for your Dell Computer, shall we?</p>

<p>**Dell Inspiron Mini 1012 Memory<br />
**<br />
The Dell Inspiron Mini 1012 comes standard from dell with 1GB of RAM but can be expanded to 2GB by replacing the factory installed 1GB PC2-4200 sodimm and replacing it with a bigger 2GB memory upgrade</p>

<p><strong>Dell Inspiron M101z Memory</strong></p>

<p>The Dell Inspiron M101z ships from Dell with 2GB of DDR3 1333MHz RAM but you can and should increase the ram to 8GB of RAM. To do this, replace the 2x1GB memory chips and replace thew with 2x4GB memory upgrades for Dell M101z</p>

<p><strong>Dell Inspiron 15 Memory</strong></p>

<p>The Dell Inspiron 15 (1545) ships from Dell with 1GB of RAM so a 4GB RAM upgrade to the maximum is reccommended for maximum Inspiron 15 performance.</p>

<p><strong>Dell Inspiron 14 Memory</strong></p>

<p>The Dell Inspiron 14 (1440) offers 2GB of RAM standard from the factory and can be upgraded to 4GB of DDR3 1066 sodimms</p>

<p><strong>Dell Inspiron 14R Memory</strong></p>

<p>The Dell Inspiron 14R starts at 2GB of RAM as standard memory configuration and can be upgraded to 8GB of ram using ddr3 1066 SDRAM sodimms. To upgrade to 8GB of RAM you would replace the two 1GB RAM memory modules with larger 4gb RAM for Dell Inspiron 14R.</p>

<p><strong>Dell Inspiron 15R Memory</strong></p>

<p>The Dell Inspiron 15R Laptop starts from the dell factory shipped with 3GB of DDR3 but can be upgraded by installing 4GB x 2 memory upgrades for Dell Inspiron 15R</p>

<p><strong>Dell Inspiron 17R Memory</strong></p>

<p>The Dell Inspiron 17R notebook, or laptop comes from dell with 3GB DDR sdram sodimms installed but you can remove these and install 2x4GB DDR 1066 memory for much greater performance for your new dell. You can install up to 8GB of memory into the Dell Inspiron 17R notebook</p>

<p><strong>Dell Studio 15R Memory</strong></p>

<p>The Dell Studio 15R ships with just 2GB of RAM for operating with, which is too little, I think. You’re much better off upgrading the Studio 15R from dell to the maximum 4GB of RAM by installing 2x2GB PC2-6400 sodimms.</p>

<p><strong>Dell Studio 17 Memory</strong></p>

<p>Dell Studio 17 (1749) is desktop replacement computer for some so it makes the most sense to upgrade the memory on this big screen beauty and it will take up to 8GB of RAM for better performance. Install 2x4GB DDR3 1066 SDRAM sodimms and you’ll never want for more memory again.</p>

<p><strong>Alienware M11x Memory</strong></p>

<p>The Alienware M11x will accept up to 8GB of RAM and you can buy memory for Alienware M11x pretty cheap by adding 2x4GB DDR3 1066MHz for maximum memory performance from your alienware notebook or laptop</p>

<p>**Alienware M15x Memory<br />
**<br />
The Alienware M15x accepts up to 8GB of memory by replacing the 3GB of RAM it ships with and upgrading to a much more useable 8GB of RAM for Alienware M15X by replacing the memory with 4GB DDR3 sodimms</p>

<p><strong>Alienware M17x Memory</strong></p>

<p>The Alienware M17x also runs better with 8GB of RAM when you replace the 4GB that came standard. Install DDR3 1066 4GB x 2 and watch your Alienware run at blazing fast speeds.</p>

<p>And there you have it. <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com">Dell memory upgrades</a> for the most current notebooks, netbooks and laptops currently on sale by Dell.</p>

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p> <br />
Maybe you’re in the market for ram and memory, or maybe you want to buy a dogde ram truck (you have the wrong site if that’s you need). Let’s stick to ram and memory, shall we? It’s tricky to shop for ram . One memory store I came across had five different ways you could shop for ram:<br />
When you have a ram price list in front of you you’ll be able to see at a quick glance what the best ram price for your needs will be.When you’re in the market for memory, whether you’re looking to compare prices on ram upgrades or you just want to buy some ram or memory from a store you can trust you’re usually wanting to refer to one thing and that’s a ram price list of some sort.</p>

<p>shop by ram type</p>

<p>shop by ram brand</p>

<p>shop by computer manufacturer</p>

<p>download software and it will tell you what ram you need.</p>

<p>shop by memory configurator – you use the pull-down menus and select your computer manufacturer, and model name of your computer and the memory configuration tool tells you what ram you need and usually returns a ram price list of all the ram available for your desktop or notebook computer from Apple, Dell, HP and so on..</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW">Cheap RAM</a></strong></p>

<p>The ram memory configurator is the most popular to use when shopping for ram, whether it’s for your PC or Mac. Some memory stores really promote this tool (crucial comes to mind), while other stores prefer you to know what type of RAM you need.</p>

<p>When RAM shopping, if it gets too complicated you can always email me and I’ll do my best to help or I’ve made few price lists for ram over the years that will help you get the best deal on ram upgrades. And by best deal, I don’t mean lowest price.<br />
Some other memory price trackers (even google does this) emphasizes low prices as the best price but with RAM this isn’t the case a lot of the times. Some of the lowest price memory stores I used to track have gone out of business over the years, while the higher priced but still competitive memory stores are still in business after all these years.</p>

<p>These are the memory stores I track and monitor – the memory stores that are reputable and offer a fair price on ram. Every ram store at very least uses the memory configurator as it’s the easiest method to shop for ram. All you have to do is enter your make and model of computer and back comes a specialized <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com">ram price list</a> with the best memory prices available for your specific computer.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW">Memory Prices Have Dropped in 2010</a></strong></p>

<p>There are a few variables to determine what RAM Memory Price is for you and best suits your needs when it comes to shopping for ram upgrades, or memory upgrades. (For the remainder of this article, RAM and Memory will be used as they have the exact same meaning.</p>

<p>RAM is the best upgrade to your computer that you can do. In fact, I whole heartedly suggest you max out your memory – especially if you are looking to upgrade a netbook or laptop computer as there’s a lot of performance in your portable computer but the manufacturers have this bad habit sometimes of only installing the minimum ram required to start the operating system.</p>

<p>The reasons computer makers like Apple, Dell, HP, Toshiba and others do this is simple: price. Memory is not free (yet) and it costs more money to configure a computer with the maximum memory possible so what they have done to become more price competitive is to transfer the cost to you and allow you to bear the cost.</p>

<p>Oh sure – Apple, Dell and all will be happy to sell you ram for your new notebook (or desktop) but it won’t be the cheapest ram you can buy by any stretch. These are big companies with lots of overhead, employees, distribution networks and other costs that tend to mark up the price of ram to silly amounts by the time it gets to you. Dell, Apple and company are interested in one thing: profit. Not saving you memory on ram.</p>

<p>But you don’t neccessarily want to increase the coffers of the big computer makers: you just want ram for for your laptop or desktop at a fair price. Maybe it’s the lowest price you can get on ram or maybe you’d prefer to spend a little more but whatever you choose you can get a much better deal on ram than when you buy it from the big computer manufacturers.</p>

<p>Part of the reason you can buy RAM cheaper from various 3rd party memory stores is that you’re buying generic ram. What’s generic ram? You’ve seen the no-name cereal at the grocery store, yes? It’s the same idea -you’re still buying corn flakes but you don’t get the fancy box or brand. Some memory stores actually carry two or more different types of RAM: Generic memory and brand name RAM so you can decide what ram to buy and whether you want to save money on ram or whether you’re willing to spend more and buy name brand ram, only you can decide that – as it’s your money you are spending on ram and memory.</p>

<p>But whatever you choose you can get the best <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com">RAM Memory Price</a> by comparing ram prices and make an informed memory buying decision.</p>
