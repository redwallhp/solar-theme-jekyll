<p>I was asked this question today:</p>

<p><em>Jim, I am buying a MacBook Pro, should I get the 8GB ram upgrade and who should I buy the ram from? Should I Buy the RAM from the Apple Store?</em></p>

<p><em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1149" title="Cheapest MacBook Pro" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-24-at-7.39.14-AM1.png" alt="Best MacBook Pro Price" width="283" height="223" /></a></em></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I">Best Place To Buy a MacBook Pro</a></strong></p>

<p>There’s a few questions to answer there so let’s break this down into parts shall we?</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Congrats on the MacBook Pro.  It’s a powerful computer that will work for you for some time depending on your needs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yes, I suggest maxing out the MacBook Pro with as much RAM as you can and for the MBP’s that’s 8GB of RAM and you get there by either buying an 8GB RAM Kit for the MacBook Pro or you buy 2x4GB RAM Upgrades individually, but you will need two of them.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>And here’s why I think that you should <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="max out the ram macbook pro">max out the ram on the  MacBook Pro:</a> It’s a professional computer and you’re going to drop at least $1500 to buy the professional laptop computer but you’re on the fence about memory upgrades, which cost a fraction of what you spent on the  Apple notebook itself but will offer probably the best value for your computing dollar. As I write this, <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_Pro_KITS_(1066_DDR3)-8gb/" title="8GB for MacBook Pro">8GB for MacBook Pro</a> will set you back about $250 for you to max out your ram and get some work done that will pay the bills. I guess it’s the economy but you’ve just spent a good chunk of change on a notebook but you won’t upgrade the RAM?</p>

<ol>
  <li>Which brings us to the next question – where should you buy your MacBook Pro? The Apple Store is good but you’ll pay full load for it there. When pick up a<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26x%3D0%26ref_%3Dnb_sb_noss%26fsc%3D6%26ih%3D8_0_0_0_0_1_1_0_0_1.3_102%26y%3D0%26field-keywords%3Dmacbook%2520pro%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957" title="macbook pro deal"> MacBook Pro from Amazon </a>you can save a few percentage points and use the savings to buy more RAM. If you do buy your MacBook Pro from Apple, you might be able to save some money as you can order the MBP filled with RAM as a custom configuration but I’m warning you: Apple RAM is not the cheapest RAM you can buy. But do the math as you might be better off getting the RAM and Computer from the same store to save you money.  Take the ten minutes or so to shop around and get the best price on a MacBook Pro with 8GB of RAM, regardless of where you buy.</li>

<p>What is the <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="best macbook pro memory">Best MacBook Pro Memory</a></strong>?</p>

<p>This is just another question I get asked a whole lot and yet I’m reluctant to suggest any one particular store because then I would of course be showing a bias towards one computer memory reseller and  I don’t want to do that.</p>

<p>[table id=1 /]</p>

<p>But what I can tell those that are in the market for MacBook Pro Memory that any and all memory stores on ramseeker will gaurantee your memory upgrades so you can be sure that you’re not buying memory from a shady memory reseller and believe me, they’re out there.</p>

<p>[table id=15 /]</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I"><img title="Cheapest MacBook Pro" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-24-at-7.39.14-AM1.png" alt="Best MacBook Pro Price" width="283" height="223" /></a></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I">Best MacBook Pro Prices</a></strong></p>

<p>So what to look for when shopping for best MacBook Pro memory? Customer service is on the top of my list and I also dont’ mind paying a bit more for name brand too. But that’s my opinion only but if I have a choice between generic ram and name brand, I will chose the name brand ram every time even though you can buy generic ram cheaper.</p>

<p>There’s nothing wrong with generic ram and it is cheaper -whether for MacBook Pro or any other computer, the generic stuff is still tested and guaranteed to work from each and every store I list that sells <strong>MacBook Pro Memory</strong>. You can’t <strong>buy generic RAM</strong> from these stores and go wrong and that’s the reason I list the memory store’s prices.</p>

<p>I have never allowed any sneaky or shady prices on ramseeker to be posted, which unlike some other sites the price comparisons do match what is on the memory store’s site and it’s the price on ram you can expect to pay. No bait and switch or other questionable tactics are allowed.</p>

<p>I will tell you that I do  list and track MacBook Pro ram prices that are the lowest price as that’s why you’re here  – to compare prices on memory upgrades from reputable memory stores, and I hope you’re happy with my efforts. But to do so this usually means that to be competitive I’m tracking MacBook Pro generic RAM to get the best ram prices for you.</p>

<p>Sometimes I can do better and get you discounts on ram upgrades that are exclusive to ramseeker and you can’t find a better deal on MacBook Pro RAM from any other website. I  work hard to get you the best MacBook Pro RAM Prices  and that’s just one of the many Apple RAM upgrades I track. The special deals are already listed for you too. You do not need any memory upgrade coupon code. I have tried to offer you that in the past and it wasn’t worth the effort. It’s much easier and better for all parties to have a special ‘ramseeker price’ for RAM and list that price as the best price on RAM at the time.</p>

<p>If you are looking for the best price on Macbook Pro RAM you’re at at the right place.</p>

<p>Let me know if you need any help with your ram upgrades.</p>

<p>Do you need help with **buying memory **for your new or old computer? I’m happy to offer ram shopping help and you can always email me at jim at ramseeker.com. I don’t sell memory but I do and can recommend the right and correct memory upgrades for your computer regardless of what make it is or notebook or desktop computer.</p>

<p>Most memory stores do offer a memory configurator which is usually a pull down menu or some times it’s a list of links to popular or new memory upgrades that are popular for  most of the newer and modern computers as these are the most computers that can benefit from a ram upgrade.</p>

<p>The memory configurators are a good way to find out what RAM or Memory your computer needs but it gets confusing  as to what Memory you need. If you’re just an average computer user you don’t care about MHz or GHz or bus speeds or all the other technical  mumbo jumbo. All you want to do is to speed up your computer by using more ram and it will</p>

<p>Adding more ram is like moving into a bigger house. Instead of there being no room for your computer to work with, when you add ram it’s like now your computer has enough space to get things done and keep all the data organized and labeled and ready to use at a moment’s notice which is what ram does. stores stuff that the computer is going to need soon. It’s the technical equivalent of  “here hold this for a second”.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001KB6Z2U/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001KB6Z2U"><img title="Best RAM Prices" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-3.00.24-PM.png" alt="Cheapest RAM Prices" width="309" height="308" /></a></p>

<p>And there’s no reason why you shouldn’t upgrade your computer memory these days as ram is cheap and spending $100 on RAM is much better bang for buck for your computing dollar than say, spending it on a software update just because there’s a new version out, when the old software you have works just fine. (Windows Vista, anyone?)</p>

<p>But with RAM, unless you’re buying very large and very new technology – is pretty cheap. $100 for most notebooks gets you 4GB of memory which is what I recommend at a bare minimum for computing in 2010.</p>

<p>Again, I don’t sell RAM. I just like to shop for RAM and help you get the best price from a fair and reputable memory store on your memory upgrades, that’s it.</p>

<p>If you do need help when <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="shopping for ram">shopping for ram </a>or memory don’t hestitate to contact me if you can’t figure out what type or size of RAM your computer needs. I’m here to help you.</p>

<p>Now that it’s 2012,  it’s pretty easy to say that the minimum memory for today’s Apple Macintosh computers when it comes to <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="mac memory">Mac Memory</a> is 4GB of RAM. I could be wrong but I know the new MacBooks ship with 2gb of RAM standard and I’m pretty sure that the Mac Mini’s do too and the MacBook Pros start at 4gb of RAM and the Mac Pros can be filled with 64gb of ram if you’ve got deep enough pockets.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001265GI2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001265GI2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1300" title="Cheap 4GB Mac RAM" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-3.03.21-PM.png" alt="Cheap RAM for Macs 4GB" width="272" height="313" /></a></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001265GI2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001265GI2">Cheap 4GB RAM for Mac</a></strong></p>

<p>All this to say if you’re shopping for a memory upgrade for a new MacBook or Macbook Pro or, yes even Mac Mini – that you should have your sights on at very least 4GB of RAM for these Macs.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/iMac_KITS_(DDR3_1333)/" title="imac 16gb ram kits">The iMac will accept up to 16gb of RAM</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/Mac_Mini_KITS_(1066_DDR3)/" title="Mac mini memory upgrade kits">The Mac Mini will accept up to 8GB of RAM </a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_KITS_(1066_DDR3)/" title="macbook memory kits 4gb">The MacBooks will accept up to 4GB of RAM </a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_Pro_KITS_(1066_DDR3)/" title="macbook pro ram kits">The MacBook Pros will take up to 8GB</a> *(and  my guess is 16gb for MacBook Pros at next refresh). *</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/Mac_Pro_RAM_Upgrade_Kits_DDR3_1333_with_8GB_RAM/" title="Mac Pros 64gb memory">The Mac Pros will take up to 64GB. </a></p>

<p>But with it being back to school season, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26x%3D0%26ref_%3Dnb_sb_noss%26fsc%3D4%26ih%3D4_1_1_1_0_0_1_0_0_2.7_96%26y%3D0%26field-keywords%3Dmacbook%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957" title="buying a macbook">buying a MacBook</a> is going to be a popular activity over the next month or thereabouts so I want to talk about MacBook Memory as this is probably the  one computer form Apple that could really benefit from a 4gb Mac Memory Upgrade.</p>

<p>At 2gb stanard, Apple had to cut corners somewhere to get the MacBook to the Magical $999 price so they tossed 2x1Gb chips in it and said good enough..  (which I think is still a lot for what it is, but that’s a topic for another day). 4gb for MacBook  will turn your MB into a much more useable machine and 4gb is no money these days and the result of hte macbook ram upgrade will be making it more capable and it doesn’t matter what you’re doing with it surfing, email and so on will run faster and smoother with more memory for your portable mac.</p>

<p>If you’re running a Mac with 2GB or less and it’s a newer modern machine you should stop what you’re doing right now and see if you can get 4gb of RAM into your Mac somehow.</p>

<p>If you can’t add 4GB of RAM you might be better off buying a new Mac that allows 4gb.</p>

<p>4GB of RAM for all Macs released in 2010 should be the minimum amount in my opinion.</p>

<p>Installing Memory in a MacBook Pro (or macbook) is pretty easy and can be don by the average computer user without any special tools or know-how.</p>

<p>First, you need to buy new macbook pro RAM  to install (see current prices on MacBook Pro Memory above) and replace the standard MacBook Pro memory that came installed with your computer in the first place. **Add as much macbook pro ram as you can afford. **You can never never go wrong when shopping for macbook pro ram when you buy ram from my list of authorized <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="macbook pro stores">macbook pro stores</a>. Brand can matter for some people when it comes to shopping for MacBook Pro RAM as there’s a small chance that the brand name stuff will work a bit better  in your MacBook Pro as usually it’s been tested and guaranteed to work. Generic MacBook Pro RAM works just fine too but you might be buying a wee bit more peace of mind when you buy the name brand ram. The cheapest RAM may or may not be the the best price on MacBook Pro RAM.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I"><img title="Cheapest Apple MacBook Pro" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-3.05.45-PM.png" alt="Best MacBook Pro Prices" width="294" height="209" /></a></p>

<p>[table id=1 /]</p>

<p>Once you have the RAM in your hand, you might want to invest in an anti-static wrist band. Sometimes you can buy the anti-static wrist band at the same time as you buy the MacBook Pro RAM, but  sometimes you’ll have to go elsewhere to buy an antistatic wrist band for installing memory. Your local computer store can usually help you.</p>

<p>You don’t NEED an antistatic wrist band if you’re sure to discharge any static electricity you have on you by touching  the metal casing of  your macbook pro first to discharge any static before you install the macbook pro ram. Also, it’s probably not a good idea to wear wool sweaters on a dry winter day or rub balloons on your head just before you install the macbook pro memory.  Be sure to discharge any static electricity before you go about installing RAM yourself. RAM is very particular and can be damaged by static electricity. When you bought it, you should have received it in an anti-static bag and sometimes there’s a big warning sticker on the bag that you have to break before you can access the ram and it says the same thing I’ve been saying: <strong>static electricity is bad for ram</strong></p>

<p>Once you’re all set to go then all you do is  remove the battery of your macbook pro, take  of the bottom part, or sometimes even then entire bottom. You might need a very small philips screwdriver or sometimes a specific torx screwdriver to do this. On my MacBook Pro, to add more ram once I had the cover off, I had to unplug and remove the MacBook Pro hard drive before I could access the RAM slots.</p>

<p>Once there, there’s two slots for MacBook Pro RAM and to remove the old MacBook Pro memory there’s two tabs that hold down the ram and when I did this the memory popped up to a 45 degree angle  which allowed me take hold of the memory (watch that static!) and with a slight pull I removed the memory. I did the same thing when removing the ram from the second memory slot and in no time I was ready to install my new MacBook Pro RAM.</p>

<p>For the actual installation of memory on my MacBook Pro all I did was the reverse. You slip the memory in at about a 45 degree angle into the slots and seat the memory into the slot. It’s a tight fit sometimes so don’t be afraid to use some gentle pressure. Push down on the RAM once it’s seated and the two little tabs click in to lock the memory down into the macbook pro’s memory slots. Repeat for the second memory slot in the MacBook Pro and you can’t go wrong really. The RAM has a little notch in it so you can’t install the memory backwards or upside down. The RAM only fits into the slot one way.</p>

<p>When you have your MacBook Pro ram installed,  all you do is replace what you removed to get at the memory upgrades slots. replace the hard drive, screw the cover or bottom of the MacBook Pro back on and replace the MacBook Pro Battery.  Press the power button and your MacBook Pro should start up without any trouble and now the MacBook Pro will run faster too and allow you to get your work done quicker.</p>

<p>Apple has excellent instructions on <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="how to install macbook pro ram">how to install MacBook Pro RAM </a> and you can find them by <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1270" title="install macbook pro ram">clicking here</a>. They’ve got instructions for a whole range of MacBook Pros so I suggest you refer to their instructions before installing MacBook Pro memory on your own.</p>

<p><strong>Where to Buy 8GB of RAM</strong></p>

<p>If you’re shopping online for 8GB of RAM there are loads of memory shops, stores,vendors whatever you wan to call them that will be more than happy to sell you 8GB of RAM.</p>

<p>But you should do your homework first. You might think it’s the best idea to shop for the lowest priced RAM but sometimes, not always – this is not the best way to buy ram as yes, price is king for RAM or anything else but memory is pretty advanced stuff. It’s not like  you’re buying a cup of coffee here. You’re buying what was once thought of impossible:8GB of memory for a very competitive price regardless of you who you end up buying RAM from and it wouldn’t hurt you to do some smart shopping and buy RAM from someobody who knows the business and what RAM you need for your computer.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW"><img title="Best Price 8GB MacBook Pro" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-3.09.11-PM.png" alt="Cheapest MacBook Pro 8GB" width="309" height="214" /></a></strong></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW">8GB MacBook Pro RAM</a></strong></p>

<p> </p>

<p>There are thousands and thousands of different computer models out there and each and every one  of them could benefit from a memory upgrade but some won’t even accept the 8GB  memory so that’s the first thing you need to know: How much RAM can your computer handle?</p>

<p>Next, will your OS recognize  the RAM. If you’re running an older version of windows or even the latest windows 7 be sure to check and be sure you can use and benefit from an 8GB RAM upgrade as you’re just throwing your money away if your computer won’t acknowledge the memory upgrade in the first place.</p>

<p>Once you’ve got those two things solved, you need to decide on  what’s important to you when shopping for RAM. Are you on a budget and the only way  you can  upgrade your memory is if you buy the cheapest RAM, or do you have a few more dollars to spend on brand name ram vs generic ram. Brand name RAM might be no better than generic, but for some it’s important to know that their memory came from a specific supplier as opposed to some that are nothing more than ram resellers.</p>

<p>How about customer service?  If you’re a programmer or IT specialist or even just an advanced hobbyist than you probably know your way around a memory upgrade and you probably have a favorite place to buy ram already and don’t care about customer service.</p>

<p>But if you’re new to computers and wouldn’t mind a bit of help with the memory upgrades both in the pre-sale and after sale  support you might be better off buying your 8GB RAM from somebody who offers the support you need.</p>

<p>Now that we have all our options and preferences when it comes to buying ram online (or even in store) we can go shopping for 8GB RAM. I suggest you buy 8GB of RAM from the following memory vendors:</p>

<p>Crucial Technology</p>

<p>18004Memory</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memoryx">Memory X </a></p>

<p>OEMPCWORLD</p>

<p>RAMJET</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memorytogo">Memory To Go </a></p>

<p>Other World Computing</p>

<p>These memory suppliers, or stores have been in business for over ten years, some closer to twenty and all will support you both in offering the best price on 8GB of RAM regardless of whether you are shopping for ram for Apple, Dell, HP or Sony Computers to name a few, the above listed memory sellers will help you get the right 8GB ram for the best price.</p>

<p>Good luck shopping for<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="8GB RAM Memory"> 8GB of RAM Memory</a></p>

<p>Unfortunately you cannot upgrade a MacBook to 8GB of RAM or Memory. <strong>Yet</strong>.</p>

<p>To get 8GB into an Apple notebook you’ll need to be working with a MacBook Pro as one of the advantages is that the MacBook Pro models can accept and recognize more  RAM than the lesser MacBooks and that’s just one of the few differnces when you compare the two macbook lines from Apple</p>

<p>The good news (and we’re talking about 2010 MacBook and MacBook Pros here is that you can  upgrade your MacBook to 4GB – and for the market the MacBook is aimed at (ie: consumer and educational market) 4GB of RAM is more than enough RAM for your MacBook. If you need 8GB of RAM than consider the MacBook Pro 13 inch if you want to fill a MacBook with 8GB of RAM.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW"><img title="Best Price 8GB MacBook Pro" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-3.09.11-PM.png" alt="Cheapest MacBook Pro 8GB" width="309" height="214" /></a></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW">Best Apple MacBook Pro 8GB RAM</a></strong></p>

<p>But forget about 8GB for MacBook Pros for  a second as we’re going to assume you have a MacBook or are considering buying a MacBook and regardless: you need more RAM for your MacBook.</p>

<p>The good news is 4GB MacBook RAM is much cheaper than 8GB of MacBook Pro RAM anyway so do yourself a favor and upgrade your MacBook and sell the original RAM that came with your MacBook back  to the memory stores. I know that OEMPCWORLD and RAMJET are just two memory stores that will buy your memory back from you. This is one way to offset the cost of your MacBook RAM upgrade even more as now you can upgrade your MacBook for even less. Currently a 4GB memory upgrade kit for MacBook  is priced under $100 whereas 8GB for MacBook Pros run a little under $300 still. If you managed to sell your old MacBook Memory you’re well under $100 for a MacBook that’s maxed out with memory. Don’t go out one night, eat at home instead  (I like pizza) and you’ll have saved enough money to upgrade your MacBook to the maximum 4GB of RAM.</p>

<p>If you have an older MacBook you can still get at very least 2GB of ram into your older MacBook for example a black macbook from circa 2006 or so is still a very useable and viable computer and and upgrade to 2gb costs about the same as a night at the movies so it’s my opinion it would be silly not to upgrade your macbook, regardless of when you bought it or what year it is.</p>

<p>For MacBook RAM prices I list  <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_KITS_(1066_DDR3)-4gb/" title="macbook 4gb memory kits">4gb macbook  upgrade kits</a> for newer models of MacBooks and if you have an older version of the Macbook you’re best off to upgrade with <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_(PC5300_DDR_KITS)-2gb/" title="macbook 2gb pc5300 memory upgrade kits">2GB MacBook PC5300 DDR memory upgrade kits.</a></p>

<p>I thought I’d take a minute or so and go over some MacBook Pro Memory upgrade options as Apple has this habit of calling every Pro MacBook they’ve released over the years MacBook Pro. Matte Screen, Glossy Screen, Santa Rosa, i3, i5, i7, Intel Core 2 Processors the list goes on and on.</p>

<p>If you’re buying a new MacBook Pro 13 inch, 15 inch, or 17 inch doesn’t matter. They all take the same RAM or Memory and that’s 1066 DDR3 sodimms. You can buy the ram from the Apple store (if you’ve got money to burn) or you can buy it from reputable third party vendors that you can trust such as: RAMJET, OWC, 18004Memory, MemoryX, OEMPCWORLD and Memory To Go. All these online memory stores know all about MacBook Pros  and what RAM goes where.</p>

<p>I’ve made a handy dandy little list of <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_Pro_(1066_DDR3)/" title="macbook pro 1066 ddr3">MacBook Pro DDR3 1066 RAM Prices</a> and also, <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_Pro_KITS_(1066_DDR3)/" title="macbook pro memory upgrade kits">MacBook Pro DDR3 1066 Memory Upgrade Kits</a>. I suggest you check out both pages to get the<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="best ram deal"> best deal on ram</a> for a new (or new-ish) MacBook Pro.</p>

<p>For the older MacBook Pros you’ll need <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_Pro_(PC5300_DDR)/" title="macbook pro pc5300 ddr">PC5300 DDR2 SDRAM sodimms</a>. This sounds like a mouthful of  technical jargon and it is but if you’ve got an older MacBook Pro  (older than  two years old) than there’s a good chance you need the PC5300 DDR MacBook Pro RAM as opposed to the newer 1066MHz  MacBook Pro RAM.</p>

<p>And, again I happen to have a handy list of all the memory stores you can buy MacBook Pro RAM from for both <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_Pro_(PC5300_DDR_KITS)/" title="macbook pro pc5300 ddr memory upgrade kits">MacBook Pro PC5300 DDR memory upgrade kits </a>and MacBook  Pro PC5300 DDR modules priced individually.</p>

<p>Why the difference between the modules and the memory upgrade kits? Because over time I have found some stores list all their memory upgrades as memory modules yet others chose to market their ram upgrades as kits. You need to upgrade MacBook Pro RAM 2 at a time anyway (or at least, it’s recommended to do so) so it makes sense to sell the MacBook Pro RAM in matched pairs.</p>

<p>If you have no idea what RAM for the MacBook Pro you should be shopping for one quick and easy way is  to go to the Apple Menu in the top left corner of your screen (we’re assuming you’re on your macbook now) and select about your Mac. You’ll get information about your processor and memory at the same time and from there it’s easy to see as Apple tells you what ram speed you’re running and what type – exactly what you need to figure out what RAM is best for your specific MacBook Pro model.</p>

<p>Here’s my MacBook info as an example:</p>

<p>I have been monitoring memory prices for iMac since the very beginning with the very first  iMac ever released and I have come to realize that this very popular computer continues to offer the best bang for your dollar when shopping for an Apple desktop computer. And the value increases tremondously if you add more RAM to your Apple iMac – especially if you choose to maximize the amount of Memory installed in  your computer.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8IO6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8IO6"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1309" title="iMac RAM Memory" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-3.14.09-PM.png" alt="Cheap iMac Deals" width="297" height="267" /></a></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8IO6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8IO6">Cheapest Apple iMacs</a></strong></p>

<p>When deciding on the best memory upgrade size to install in new computers, or iMacs rather,  our friends at Apple are most concerned with installing the bare minimum of RAM so that the Mac OS will load on the iMac and maybe an application will run – something like Apple’s Mail program or Safari the Apple web browser.</p>

<p>But what if  you want  to get the most performance out of your iMac? You add more memory. Memory for the Apple iMacs have dropped in price considerably especially for the larger 8gb and now 16GB memory upgrade kits. When the 4GB DDR3 1066Mhz memory for Apple iMacs first came on the scene you’d be digging deep deep deep into your pockets and you’d not be suprised to pay almost what the Apple iMac costs but just in adding new RAM or Memory. 4GB RAM was priced at almost $500 per memory module.</p>

<p>Thankfully with any new technology ram prices keep on dropping over time and now you can <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="buy 4gb ddr3 memory">buy 4GB DDR3 for much less</a> yet still get the benefit of maximum performance that a maxed out iMac can provide you.</p>

<p>And now with the newer and latest iMacs you can even expand the RAM to a whopping 16GB on the new and current Apple iMacs with intel i3, i5 and i7 processors. Just a few memory stores supply ram for the 2010 Apple iMacs but over time you can bet more and more will come online and start to supply ram for the 2010 Apple iMacs. So far, I know Crucial Technology, OWC, RAMJET and DMS stock and carry RAM for the new Apple iMacs that require the 1333MHz RAM upgrades.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/iMac_KITS_(DDR3_1333)-16gb/" title="16gb apple iMac 2010">16GB for Apple iMac 2010</a> models is still a little pricey but if you make your living with your Apple iMac the price is not even a consideration really as your time is worth much more than any upgrade memory price and you should be able to recoup the investment in no time with your new iMac working away at maximum capacity.</p>

<p>You will not regret an iMac 2010 memory upgrade, regardless of cost.</p>

<p><strong>How much RAM do I need?</strong></p>

<p>DDR3 notebook memory in the 8GB configuration is the standard and most popular RAM upgrade in 2011:<br />
[table id=7 /]</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1296" title="Best RAM Prices" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-3.00.24-PM.png" alt="Cheapest RAM Prices" width="309" height="308" /></a></strong></p>

<p>If there’s a question I get asked it’s this: <strong>How much memory should I buy?</strong> And my answer always is: <strong>buy as much memory as you can afford</strong>. Obviously for some computer models buying a whole lot of ram is just extremely cost prohibititive – especially for high end desktop models like the new Apple Mac Pro. At the time I write this up, it will almost cost you $3000 to max out  the new <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/Mac_Pro_RAM_Upgrade_Kits_DDR3_1333_with_8GB_RAM/" title="mac pro max out ram">Mac Pro to 64GB of RAM</a>.  I know,  that’s pretty expensive ram upgrades, but this is an exception and not a rule. This is new memory for a new computer model and ram prices historically have dropped over time.</p>

<p>But for consumer systems and especially notebook computer upgrades, my advice is to max out the memory with as much as possible and then forget about it until you’re ready to upgrade to your next computer. For the most part, RAM doesn’t go bad (there’s exceptions) but if you buy memory from reputable companies that sell ram usually you install the memory and you’re done. And you get years of enjoyment out of your computer. You paid top dollar for your computer so it only makes the most sense to get the maximum performance out of it.</p>

<p>Desktop applications might be a bit different as there’s many memory slots (at least 4) for most desktop computers and then you’ll have to do some thought and research. You might still benefit from filling your desktop with ram as it’s one of the easiest ways to get top performance out of your home or office computer. With more and more consumers interested in hobbies such as digital photography and video editing these new breed of computer users could indeed benefit from a RAM upgrade as these are applciations that thrive on lots of memory.</p>

<p>This is just a quide but for 2010 4GB of RAM is the new low ram upgrade and most computers start with a base of at least this amount and sometimes even more. But 4GB is a good start.  If you don’t have 4GB of RAM find out how much ram you currently have and see if you can upgrade to 4GB. If not, you might want to consider a new computer, but I recommend 4GB, but machines that max out at 2GB are still useable too. Most netbooks made ship with just 1GB as standard RAM but for notebook computers look for 2GB or more, but 4GB of RAM is where the sweet spot is in <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="ram upgrades today">ram upgrades today</a></p>
