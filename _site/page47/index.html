<p>It’s 2011 and most, but not all Apple computers currently shipping today accept the more modern DDR 1333Mhz memory upgrades, at least when it comes to currently shipping desktop computers such as the Apple iMac or Mac Pro. But at the time of writing this the MacBook,  MacBook Pro and Mac Mini Apple computers all still use and require <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="ddr3 1066mhz">DDR3 1066MHz memory upgrades</a>:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1239" title="Cheapest MacBook Pro 8GB Kits" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-11.02.05-AM1.png" alt="Best 8GB MacBook Pro RAM" width="312" height="296" /></a></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW">Apple 8GB DDR3 SDRAM On Sale</a></strong></p>

<p>MacBook Pro DDR3 1066 memory upgrades are priced by memory stores either as <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_Pro_KITS_(1066_DDR3)/" title="macbook pro memory upgrade kits">MacBook Pro  memory upgrade kits </a>or <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_Pro_(1066_DDR3)/" title="macbook pro ram upgrades">MacBook Pro memory upgrade modules</a> which are priced individually, but you will need to <strong>upgrade your MacBook Pro</strong> to the maximum 8GB (for current models) in pairs. I track and monitor memory for both as some memory  stores like to sell memory by individual module, while others prefer to offer memory on sale for Apple computers  in memory upgrade kits and sometimes even offer you a bit of a deal when compared against just buying memory individually.</p>

<p>MacBook notebook computers from Apple require the exact same DDR3 1066MHz sodimms as the MacBook Pro’s but in the case of the MacBooks, you are limited to a maximum of 4GB of RAM when you need to upgrade MacBook memory to the maximum memory to get the most performance out of your Apple computer. And as the MacBook Pro models I mentioned above, you can buy MacBook RAM upgrades as either <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_(1066_DDR3)/">MacBook memory modules</a> or <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_KITS_(1066_DDR3)/">MacBook memory upgrade kits</a>.</p>

<p>Apple iMac Models also can accept DDR3 1066 memory as well, but this applies to older iMacs as the current iMac lineup from Apple requires the DDR3 1333MHz memory upgrades. But if you have an <a href="http://www.lowendmac.com" title="older iMac">older iMac</a> you can still benefit from a memory upgrade using DDR3 1066Mhz memory upgrades that are sold in either individual <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/iMac_(DDR3_1066)/">iMac memory</a> or as <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/iMac_KITS_(DDR3_1066)/" title="imac memory upgrade kits">iMac memory kits.</a></p>

<p>DDR3 1066Mhz memory upgrades are cheaper in part than have been in the past due to the fact in part that faster memory upgrades are being introduced to be compatible with the faster Apple computers, but if there ever was a time to buy Apple DDR3 1066MHz RAM this is it, as the early adopters have paid the premium for this type of Apple Memory Upgrade leaving you to save money on Apple DDR3 1066 RAM.</p>

<p>When shopping for RAM you essentially have two choices when you are wanting to upgrade your computer with ram and memory. It doesn’t matter whether you have a notebook computer or a desktop computer you really only have two decisions to make when you’re ready to buy RAM.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com">Do want to save money on RAM? </a></strong></p>

<p>**Do you want to buy the best ram brand you can buy? **</p>

<p>That’s it and under most conditions you can’t  have both. But what you can do is buy generic ram which is the cheaper RAM of the two and is also the ram price I list and track as every visitor to ramseeker is looking to buy the best ram at the best price, so generic it is. This way,  I am comparing prices on ram for the cheapest ram you can buy for your Apple Computer.</p>

<p>If you want to <a href="http://youbuythebest.com">buy the best </a>ram brand, buy the RAM from Apple.  But you’ll pay. Oh boy will you pay… but you do get peace of mind in that the best ram brand will be from the computer manufacturer. In Apple’s case it’s rare that they actually make the RAM so you’re probably buying Apple branded memory as opposed to memory that apple actually makes. My last Macbook came with Samsung memory installed if I recall correctly.</p>

<p>Most memory stores today carry both a cheaper generic ram, which runs fine for most applications and is much  much cheaper memory than the name brand stuff. But for those to drive a mercedes over a chevy, they’re willing to pay for the extra money and buy the name brand memory and the stores I list ram prices for also carry the name brand stuff too.</p>

<p>To summarize, when shopping for RAM you have options. You can <strong><a href="http:///www.ramseeker.com" title="save money on ram">save money on ram</a></strong> and buy the cheap ram or you can spend a little more and buy name brand ram  too.</p>

<p>Ultimately the choice is yours to make.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2010/09/imac-memory/">iMac Memory</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8IO6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8IO6">Cheapest Apple iMac</a></strong></p>

<p>I’ve just realized that I have been tracking ram prices on <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="imac memory"><strong>iMac Memory</strong></a> for over 13 years now starting with the very first iMac, that teal green model with the round mouse that’s so old now you have to wonder if it’s even worthwhile ugrading thew ram on the original Apple iMac.</p>

<p>I tend to focus on the later iMacs models as I’ve found that’s where the demand is and it only makes sense, I think. Chances are, if you’re going to buy an iMac you’ll want to buy a new iMac as technology marches on and the iMacs just keep getting cheaper and yet better too so it’s my suggestion is when you buy an iMac and maybe it’s for back to school or you’re buying an iMac for Christmas (it’ll be here sooner than you think) and the time to upgrade iMac RAM is right when you buy the iMac.</p>

<p>You can ugrade <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/iMac_(DDR3_1333)/" title="iMac Memory">iMac Memory</a> in one of two ways: The first being to favor simple over cheap and just order your iMac from Apple and max out the iMac RAM from Apple at the same time. If time is money then this is definitely the easiest way to go, as you’re buying an apple product and filling it with apple branded ram at the same time.  The only problem  with this technique is hoo boy, will you pay. Apple RAM has consistently been higher priced than if you bought iMac RAM elsewhere. The savings can be in the hundereds of dollars, especially when you factor in the fact that 16gb of RAM is a lot of RAM for the iMac and it’s a newer technology and we all know the newer bigger ram is the most expensive  RAM you can buy.</p>

<p>The better solution is to buy Apple authorized generic  (or name brand to, but you’ll save less) from memory stores that have been in business for more than a decade and have been selling and suppprting iMac RAM since the beginning of the Apple iMac’s existence.</p>

<p>Heck, even the folks at the Apple Store suggest ramseeker as your destination for RAM because Apple only stocks new and in production products – if you’re looking to uprgrade an older Apple iMac you’re out of luck .</p>

<p>But the good new is new or old Apple iMac, I’ve got a selection of Memory stores that yes, will be happy for your business but actually support and sell memory specific to Apple’s  own memory specifications and the kicker is the iMac RAM from these guys is gauranateed to work!</p>

<p>We all know a gaurantee might not mean much depending on the source but this is just one more reason ramseeker should be your first stop when shoppping for iMac RAM. I don’t list every memory store possible. I only list memory stores that back their product with a gaurantee and have been in business for over a decade (some, two decades) and know RAM for iMacs like the backs of their hands.</p>

<p>That’s how you get the best deal on iMac RAM.  Comparing ram prices from reputable memory stores and buying iMac RAM from a memory store you can trust.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2010/08/install-ram-in-macbook-pro-2010/">Install RAM in MacBook Pro 2010</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/macbook_pro"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-386" title="Apple MacBook RAM" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2010-09-28-at-11.06.31-AM.png" alt="Macbook Memory Upgrades" width="478" height="302" /></a>You do know that it’s pretty easy to install the ram you buy from third part memory stores yourself, yes? In fact it’s not too hard at all to <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="install ram macook pro 2010">install RAM in MacBook Pro 2010</a></strong> models at all.</p>

<p>You do need a few things to start, like a clean static free work surface and a small philips screwdriver but other than some time to take your time and go slowly you can install MacBook Pro ram yourself and save yourself any unneccesary installation fee.</p>

<p>In fact, it’s so easy that Apple has <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1270" title="how to install macbook pro ram">instructions on MacBook Pro RAM installations</a> and upgrades so it’s not just due to the fact that I’m familiar with ram upgrades, the good folks at Apple think you’re up to the task too.</p>

<p>The very first thing you need to do is to shut off your computer. Don’t put it to sleep but really shut off your computer. You don’t need anything to be powered up when you’re installing or replacing ram upgrades.</p>

<p>Then you’ll need to close the MacBook Pro and flip the MacBook Pro over and remove the bottom cover with the ten screws that are holding it in place.</p>

<p>Once you’ve got the screws out and put aside safely, you want to be sure to discharge any static electricity build up that might happen by touching something metal on the MacBook Pro.</p>

<p>With the cover off, you’ll see the RAM modules from the factory right there. You don’t have to remove any hard drives or anything. What you do have to do is push the levers that hold the factory ram out so that the memory modules pop out at a 45 degree angle and then slowly remove the ram by pulling lightly the ram out of the memory socket.  Do the same for the bottom ram module too.</p>

<p>Now that you have empty RAM slots you’re ready to install your memory. There’s notches on the ram modules that line up with the memory upgrade sockets, so there’s really no way you can screw this up. With the notches lined up, insert the ram into the memory upgrade slot at about a 45 degree angle. You may have to push a bit as those memory sockets are designed to be a tight fit. Then all you do is push downwards on the ram so that it’s sitting flat an parallel to your desktop and the two little springs should click into place to hold the memory upgrade in.</p>

<p>Then just do the same again for for the second or top memory upgrade socket for the MacBook Pro – line up the notch, install the ram at 45 degrees until the ram is seated in the slot and push down until the two little tabs lock the memory module in place.</p>

<p>Replace the bottom with the ten screws  and you’re done. Turn the MacBook Pro over, press the power button and the operating system will automatically recognize your new maximum ram for MacBook Pro.</p>

<p>If you’re going to go through all the trouble of installing ram yourself, I suggest buying <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_Pro_KITS_(1066_DDR3)/" title="8gb macbook pro ram">8GB MacBook Pro RAM</a></strong> and maxing out the MacBook Pro 2010.</p>

<p>Cheap RAM has to be one of the biggest ways people find ramseeker. They type ‘cheap ram, or cheapest ram, or where can I buy cheap ram and  search engines supply you with an answer: and here you are <img src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p>I know, you’re thinking that there’s lots of stores that advertise the cheapest RAM and at times they do offer the best price on ram (this is assuming you mean best price being equal to lowest price) but I’ve found that for the most part the low price leaders for memory either do one of two things after a while:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The cheapest ram dealers go out of business. I’ve seen it at least a few times. These new vendors come on the market and state total domination but then they realize that they’ve pretty much priced themselves out of the market.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They give up trying to be the lowest price on ram upgrades because sometimes with that also comes the joys of the internet and sometimes the cost of a sale frankly,isn’t worth the effort as margins are cut so low it’s hard to make any money on RAM if you have to answer a million pre-sale and post sale support questions. Sometimes these low price memory stores realize that after a while, it’s best to be priced higher up. Less sales,  perhaps but also less grief and support costs too.</p>
  </li>

<p><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="black macbook ram">Can the Black MacBook take 8GB of RAM</a>?  The short answer is no, you cannot install 8gb of MacBook RAM into a black macbook, regardless of age. If it’s black, there’s no way  you can install 8GB of RAM into the black notebook from Apple Computer.</p>

<p>Now,  if Apple releases a new black macbook then I’ll have to update this article at a later date and revise my comment above, but for the time being the maximum ram a black macbook can take is up to 4GB of RAM for the later MacBook models.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8IO6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8IO6"><img title="8GB MacBook RAM" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-12.41.00-PM.png" alt="8GB RAM for MacBook" width="312" height="284" /></a></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8IO6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8IO6">8GB MacBook RAM</a></strong></p>

<p>When the black macbooks were first released in 2006 and subsequently 2007, the maximum ram supported by Apple for these MacBooks – both white and black – was a maximum of 2GB of RAM officially supported. But then some third party stores did some testing and found that even though the official maximum RAM for the MacBooks was 2GB this was before 2GB memory for MacBooks was even available so what they found was that even though the official maximum RAM was 2GB you could install 4gb of RAM with 2x2gb memory modules in these early macbook models. The problem  was the OS and  motherboard was only designed to accept up to 3GB tops so even though you could get 4gb of RAM in the MacBooks only 3gb would show up. So if you have an older black macbook, you may be able to get up to 3gb to show up when you buy 2x2gB memory modules for MacBook.</p>

<p>Then with later MacBook models (again, black or white) that were released in 2007 with the faster design and increased standard memory you could now see up to 6GB of RAM in a black notebook from Apple even though again the official stance from Apple was that a maximum 4GB of ram was supported. This in part is again due to the fact that 4gb ram chips for MacBooks came on the scene after the release of the MacBook models in 2007 so at the time 4gb was indeed the maximum ram for your black macbook.  But later tests found that if you installed 4gb in one of the two ram upgrade slots and another 2gb memory module in the second ram slot the macbook could use and recognize all 6gb of installed RAM. Technically, it’s not supported  by Apple but it works.</p>

<p>So although you can’t install 8GB of RAM into a Black MacBook, you may be able to max out your black MacBook RAM with either 2GB or 3GB or 6gb of RAM depending on what specific Macbook model you have.</p>

<p>The folks at OWC have a great resource that explains exactly<a href="http://eshop.macsales.com/shop/memory/MacBook/DDR2/" title="black macbook ram"> how much ram the black macbooks can accept </a>and use. I recommend you refer to it if you have any further questions on upgrading black macbook memory to the maximum allowed.</p>

<p>When shopping for ram or memory upgrades for Apple MacBook Pro computer models it’s hard sometimes to figure out what exactly is the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="best macbook pro memory">best memory upgrade for the MacBook Pro</a>.</p>

<p>MacBook Pro Memory comes from many different memory stores and is available in a selection of manufacturers such as Samsung or Micron MacBook Pro RAM and then you also need to consider whether the generic ram might be an option for your MBP as well.</p>

<p>Once you have determined whether you want generic or name brand MacBook Pro Memory the next question that tends to arise is where are you planning to or going to buy MacBook Pro RAM and at what price should you expect to pay for MacBook Pro RAM?</p>

<p>I  tend to track and monitor prices for all Apple Memory and I usually look for the best price I can find, and by best price I mean the lowest price as this site compares, tracks and lists Apple Memory prices the visitors I see tend to gravitate towards the memory that’s priced the lowest I can find.</p>

<p>Personally, I don’t think this is the best way to go about shopping for ram and I’ve stated in the past and am probably repeating myself, but  I think the real value in RAM is to buy ram from a store you can trust with an excellent return policy and that sells ram that’s guaranteed to work in your computer, whether it’s a MacBook Pro or some other memory type you really just want to buy ram that’s  priced reasonably and works in your MacBook Pro. That’s the best deal.</p>

<p>But, not everybody thinks or shops like I do and  if you’re not caring about ram prices than  I doubt you’ll ever see my site or read this. You’ll just buy ram from Apple probably and you do get the fact that when you buy Apple RAM you get great serivce, warranty and all the rest but the bummer is it will cost you a lot more money for essentially the same ram than if you bought ram from a trusted third party apple memory store.</p>

<p>And that’s where I come in. I list the lowest prices on MacBook Pro RAM and Memory but I also list the higher priced brand name RAM and Memory too as it’s my belief that the consumer should be able to make an educated choice about buying MacBook Pro RAM from memory stores they can be assured will offer the prices and support they expect and deserve as a potential customer.</p>

<p>The best price on MacBook Pro RAM depends on so many factors, and the last one you should base your memory buying decisions on is actually the price you pay at the checkout.</p>

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>Did you know that to offset costs of a memory upgrade you could sell your old memory? This makes sure that when you replace the old ram with the new ram, regardless of computer make or model, that your ram upgrade will cost less and it doesn’t matter what computer you have. You can sell your memory and the result is a cheaper upgrade for you over all.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/memorylady1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-411" title="scientist" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/memorylady1.jpg" alt="" width="423" height="284" /></a></p>

<p>Now with the MacBook (or MacBook Pro too) you should definitely be interested in this as it lets you recoup at least some value from the factory ram that you paid apple for (and probably too much too, but that’s an article for another day) when you’re ready to upgrade your MacBook RAM. And all you have to do is sell your MacBook Memory to a reputable memory store.</p>

<p>Some places like Crucial don’t want to buy back your old MacBook RAM, they just want to sell you new ram at new prices but some of the other online stores will happily buy back your old RAM. What do they do with it? I’m going to guess some vendors re-use parts as RAM is really (and I’m no expert in ram manufacturing so bear with me) but RAM modules usually have more than one chip soldered to the memory board which might be of use to make bigger ram chips or otherwise re-use your ram.</p>

<p>But we’re concerned today with where to <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com">sell your MacBook Memory</a> to, because otherwise you’ll just toss it into a junk drawer on your desk, or sell it for pennies on ebay or craigslist and when you do that you get all the fun that comes with being a private seller. But when you sell it to an authorized ram dealer, you get a fair value and you also get a better deal on your new ram effectively making your ram upgrade cheaper, which is the whole point or focus of ramseeker – getting you the right price on your next ram upgrade.</p>

<p>So who buys RAM? I know of a few Memory stores that will offer you cash for your old RAM and they are: SMS Assembly, RAMJET and OEMPCWORLD will all buy your MacBook Memory when you’re ready to upgrade. These are the few memory stores for Apple Memory that I am aware of that will buy back your old RAM from your Mac. If you’re aware of any other memory sellers who do this, leave a comment and I’ll update my list.</p>

<p>As far as prices you’ll get for your old MacBook RAM, <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/oempcworld">OEMPCWORLD</a> states that they’ll knock off another 20% off the price of new MacBook RAM and for <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/ramjet">RAMJET</a>, they’ve got handy list of <a href="http://ramjet.com/rebate.asp">ram price trade in values for mac</a>.</p>

<p>I hope</p>

But before you  can add ram to MacBook Pro you have to buy a MacBook Pro and I got asked this question today so I thought rather than reply via email that others might have the very same question too.</p>

<p>I just don’t get why you would pay full MSRP for a MacBook Pro when with about three seconds work you can get a better deal or even the <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26x%3D0%26ref_%3Dnb_sb_noss%26y%3D0%26field-keywords%3Dmacbook%2520pro%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957" title="best price on a macbook pro">best price on a MacBook Pro</a></strong>.</p>

<p>[table id=14 /]<br />
Apple’s pretty fussy on who they allow to sell their products and you will rarely find any silly deals on MacBook Pros for current shipping MacBook Pros as Apple has something that they call MAP or minimum advertised price, so if you’re a store selling MacBook Pros you can’t just slap any old price on there. This keeps the new MacBook Pro prices all the same for the most part.</p>

<p>But like anything in life there’s always exceptions. <img src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> One way to get a <strong>deal on a MacBook Pro</strong> is to buy a MacBook Pro from Amazon. Because Amazon  is so well known, and  even more so than even buying a MacBook Pro from Apple –  you know you’re going to get a good deal on MacBook Pro just because Amazon controls so much of the online marketplace. Amazon sells so much more than books these days and you can buy not only a MacBook Pro but you could also <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="buy ram">buy RAM</a> and a case at the same time and Amazon has to be the best place for bundling MacBook Pros with other stuff  you might need and they also recommend other MacBook Pros or even MacBooks for a better deal than what you’d pay from the Apple Store.</p>

<p>I don’t know but to me it makes no sense to pay full load for the very same computer just to have the privilege of buying your MacBook Pro from the Apple Store when you’re just a few clicks away from saving money on a MacBook Pro when you buy one from Amazon. Even if  you only get a small discount you still get great customer service and a MacBook Pro for your hard earned money, which is what you wanted anyway: **The best price on a MacBook Pro **</p>
