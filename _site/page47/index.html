The  Apple iMac is a very popular desktop computer from Apple and one way to better the performance of Apple&#8217;s best selling desktop computer is to add more memory and now with the latest iMac models being able to recognize 16GB of RAM the 4GB memory upgrade for Apple iMacs is a very popular memory upgrade here on ramseeker. One of the most popular memory upgrades we sell in fact, only bested by the more popular Apple notebook computers such as the MacBook and MacBook Pros

**[Cheapest Apple iMac][1]**

4GB RAM for iMac can be bought for many different Apple iMac models and depending on the specific iMac model you are looking to upgrade the price and also the memory type that your particular Apple iMac requires could be different.

Currently shipping iMacs are the most popular Apple computers to upgrade and they require the newer 1333MHz SDRAM memory upgrades. Available as either a [4GB 1333Mhz memory module][2] or as a [4GB 1333Mhz memory upgrade kit][3] which will be the cheaper of the two choices.

Just discontinued Apple iMacs this summer 2010 used the older DDR3 memory standard running at 1066Mhz which also require and can accept [4GB memory modules for iMac][4] as well as [4GB memory upgrade kits for iMac][5].

Older iMacs that require either [DDR2 PC6400 SDRAM ][6] or even [PC5300 DDR2 SDRAM][7] may  be able to accept 4GB for Apple iMac, but this will depend on your specific model of iMac, as some older Apple iMacs could only accept 2GB of RAM. [Low End Mac][8] and [Every Mac][9] are two resources that I always refer to when  checking  the memory upgrade specifications  of now discontinued Apple computers.

4GB RAM is the newest ram available for Apple iMac but is now an affordable upgrade option for those looking to either upgrade a new or even older Apple iMac computer today.

<br>

		<div class="post-content">I think adding or even maximizing memory on any computer is worth it, regardless of whether it&#8217;s a MacBook Pro, Macbook, iMac or any other Apple computer on sale today. All Apple models (and most PC models too) can benefit from a memory upgrade, and especially the MacBook Pro.

[table id=1 /]

[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1149" title="Cheapest MacBook Pro" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-24-at-7.39.14-AM1.png" alt="Best MacBook Pro Price" width="283" height="223" />][1]

**[Best MacBook Pro Deals][1]**

With the MacBook, one could argue that for most MacBook users, the 2GB of RAM that these consumer notebooks ship with from the factory is enough ram for most general computing needs such as email, web, facebook and Apple&#8217;s applications that ship with the Apple MacBook at no extra charge and they would be right. You can do just fine with 2GB of RAM on an Apple MacBook.

But a MacBook Pro is a different story. This is a professional grade notebook computer from Apple that offers added expansion ports, faster processor, and more memory expansion opportunities than what&#8217;s possible with the lesser MacBook model. Why would you not want to run your very expensive apple notebook computer as fast as you possibly can?

Maxing out the Memory on a MacBook Pro is the most cost effective upgrade you can do for this Apple notebook. At time of writing this, [Apple MacBook Pro 8GB RAM][2] sells for as little as $110.00. Assuming you maximize your new and current MacBook Pro to the full 8GB and keep your professional notebook for one year, the macbook ram upgrade works out to a little over $9.00 a month. What other way can you spend so little money to make you work faster? We&#8217;re talking 30 cents a day to upgrade your MacBook Pro so it will run faster, open more applications and just run smoother overall.

To summarize &#8211; yes, I think **upgrading the MacBook Pro RAM is worth it.** RAM Upgrades are the best bargain in computing available today.

Yes and No.

You can **[buy memory online][1]** from a wide selection of memory sellers or stores who will be more than happy to sell you memory for cheap prices and offer you a lifetime warranty on the memory upgrade and give you support if you need it, but RAM is a physical product that you insert into your desktop or notebook computer to enhance speed and performance of your computer, regardless of make.

**[Cheap Flash Memory][2]**

What you cannot do is add memory online as if RAM or memory were some kind of software or other free download. You can [buy memory][3] but it has to be shipped to you just as you would order a book from Amazon or [Flowers for Delivery][4] you buy the memory, wait for it to arrive and then follow instructions on how to install memory for your desktop or notebook computer.

**Where To Buy Computer Memory**  
I have created a list of trusted and respected memory stores that I can recommend that will be happy to sell you a memory upgrade, and except for rare instances the memory upgrade you buy from these online memory stores will be much cheaper than if you were to buy memory from the manufacturer of your computer. It&#8217;s quite easy and possible to save up to half price on memory without much trouble at all by visiting the memory stores and and noting the lowest price from each memory reseller or manufacturer.

If this sounds like a heck of a lot of work to go to each memory store and check the price for you notebook (desktops seem to be less popular these days) it is, but I have taken the opportunity to do the work for you and offer ram prices compared from a list of respectable memory stores that offer the [best ram prices][5] as well as the customer support you would expect and deserve.

RAM Memory is cheap. Especially if you buy RAM or Memory online and have it shipped to you where you can install it yourself with nothing more than some household tools you already have. But you have to buy the memory first.

<br>

		<div class="post-content">**Cheapest Notebook Memory Prices  
**  
When shopping for ram, and in my experience in tracking ram prices for close to fifteen years I essentially answer one question each and every day: &#8220;**Who has the cheapest memory**?&#8221;

**[Cheapest Memory Upgrades][1]**

In an internet and smartphone driven world, it&#8217;s easy in 2011 to enter a search term and find what you are looking for and when shopping for memory upgrades, the memory store with the lowest price on ram usually gets the sale.

But low price does not mean good price sometimes, which is why I only track and monitor ram prices from memory vendors or memory stores that are actually reputable and stand behind the products they sell by offering a no questions asked warranty and friendly and reliable customer service. It&#8217;s long been my stance to just monitor the ram prices from these memory stores and not recommend one specific memory reseller over another. I do have an option to sort by ram price, which allows you to decide where you want to spend your money on ram upgrades and I do have a section on lowest ram prices where you can see the cheapest ram prices from all memory stores.

But it&#8217;s my opinion that Cheapest RAM and Best RAM are two different things: the cheapest ram is just that &#8211; the lowest priced generic memory you can buy. The best ram is the memory upgrade you buy from a store you are comfortable with and trust. This could be the Apple Store, (definitely not the cheapest memory) or any of the honest memory stores I list. If you want the cheapest RAM, go to [craigslist][2] or [ebay][3] or [kijiji][4] and find some ram. Maybe you&#8217;ll get a bargain, and maybe you won&#8217;t and the memory you buy will not work, shut down your computer or worse. But it was cheap, right?

Forget the cheapest memory and go with the [best memory you can buy][5]. You&#8217;ll be happier with your purchase over the long time you use and  own your desktop computer

		<div class="post-content">[Ram Prices drop over time][1]. When first introduced [new memory modules][2] are very expensive to buy, and in some cases the memory upgrades can cost as much as the computer the ram upgrade is designed to be compatible with.

[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1276" title="Cheapest Computer RAM Prices" alt="Best Priced Computer RAM" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-12.34.11-PM.png" width="522" height="208" />][3]

**[Best Computer RAM for Apple][3]**

One example of this recently is the newer Mac Pro Computers that were released earlier this summer in 2010. When first introduced to add 64gb of RAM to a Apple Mac Pro would cost you just shy of $3000, but in the last six months the ram prices for Apple Mac Pro have dropped and at time of writing this article are now priced at a much more affordable (yet still pretty pricey) $1900. You save $1000 on your memory upgrades just by waiting for time and demand to increase which of course, reduces the price.

Another example of this would be when the iMac DDR3 models were released in 2008. To buy ram from Apple at the time it would cost you as much as the iMac itself to upgrade to the 8GB of RAM that the Apple iMacs could handle, but in 2011 ram upgrades for the same Apple iMac computers are now a much more affordable and cost just $110 for 8GB of DDR3 memory for the same computer. That&#8217;s a 90% ram price change in just a few years.

So if you want to **save money on ram upgrades,** one option is to just wait as the ram price trends do indicate year over year that except for rare instances, memory upgrade prices drop over time regardless of whether you need memory for an Apple Computer or Dell or HP computer as well the cheapest RAM is the memory you don&#8217;t buy today but make do with the standard ram that is already installed in your notebook or desktop computer. Most computers today come with enough memory for most consumer based tasks such as facebook, email, web browsing and so forth. If you&#8217;re a power computer or earn your living with your computer then it&#8217;s probably best to buy ram today regardless of cost as over time you will benefit from the memory upgrade and ignore any ram price trends.

**[What is the cost of memory?][1]** That&#8217;s the number 1 question I answer day in and day out here on ramseeker as this is all I do &#8211; track and monitor ram and memory upgrade prices from reputable third part vendors.

But if you think about it and save for the fewer higher end applications that require 32GB of RAM or more, memory upgrades are so cheap that the default thing to do when you get a new computer is to fill it with ram.

Let&#8217;s take the MacBook as an example:  Depending on where you buy your MacBook from the price will be about $1000 for a new MacBook today. RAM prices to completely fill your MacBook with memory, replacing the factory memory (which you can sell for even further price reductions) will cost you just under $50. That&#8217;s 1/20th the cost of the computer you want to upgrade or about the same price as a dinner out for two.

[<img title="Hard Drive Prices" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-11.44.01-AM.png" alt="Best Priced Hard Drives" width="261" height="318" />][2]

**[Hard Drive Prices Keep Dropping][2]**

<div>
</div>

But for the $50 ram upgrade you get the performance you deserve from your thousand dollar purchase for your MacBook that you paid for as with a maxed out MacBook (or any computer for that matter) you benefit from faster application launch times, more applications open at the same time and an overall feel that your very expensive notebook is just overall a faster mac with the maximum ram installed when compared to the performance you get with  the memory configuration directly from Apple.

The best part is that a year or so from now or whenever you are ready to upgrade your next computer, ram prices will continue to drop, or at very least the memory module size will get bigger so you get more gigabytes for the same memory upgrade dollar.

Considering how cheap ram has become over the years, I can strongly suggest you max out the memory on your computer. RAM is so cheap right now.

The title above sums up what [ramseeker][1] does, and in my opinion, does well.

I&#8217;m a **[RAM Memory Price Tracker][2]** for deals on ram from reputable third party vendor s and have been tracking ram prices for 14 plus years to date. That&#8217;s it, and all I do. I don&#8217;t pretend to be an Apple News site or gossip site or even a site on [apple deals][3], but when it comes to helping you buy the best memory for your Mac at the best price possible this is what I do and all I do.

**[Crucial 8GB RAM Prices][4]**

I also don&#8217;t list every company claiming to be an expert on memory. With experience comes a bit of knowledge and I know enough not to list every site that sells memory online as all it takes is a domain name and some ram to ship to open an online memory store and start pitching memory upgrades online. Instead I have opted to compare memory prices from a select few memory stores you can actually trust to sell you memory at a fair price and with outstanding support and still help you save money on Apple memory than if you had bought it from Apple directly, which in my opinion is way overpriced for what it is.

I update ram prices daily (if not hourly) so you are sure to get the right price and a fair price on your next ram upgrade from a selection of memory vendors that you can trust to offer excellent support both pre-sale and post-sale. You will also find the lowest prices for memory listed on the front page, because let&#8217;s face it &#8211; most of you look for the cheapest memory you can buy and no the best overall price but hey, it&#8217;s your money &#8211; I just help you get a good price on ram upgrades.

I have created a **[list of memory stores][5]** which will help you when you want to buy memory at a cheap price.

When shopping for Apple Memory, I&#8217;m the first to admit that it can be confusing to determine what memory you need to buy for your specific Apple Computer.

[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1239" title="Cheapest MacBook Pro 8GB Kits" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-11.02.05-AM1.png" alt="Best 8GB MacBook Pro RAM" width="312" height="296" />][1]

**[Cheapest 8GB RAM][1]**

I list memory by model type and then by memory type, so for the current Apple iMac models I list memory like this : [iMac (DDR3 1333)][2]. This means that the memory prices on this page are for iMac and are the newer DDR3 1333Mhz required for the 2010 iMacs. I could list memory prices by year, but this does not work in all cases: 2010 Mac Pros models can accept both DDR3 1066MHz memory as well as DDR3 1333Mhz SDRAM dimms so listing memory by year does not work or apply.

Most memory stores offer either an application that you can download and run for your computer which will tell you what RAM you need, but these tend to be geared towards th PC market over the Mac.  Memory configurators are another easy way to determine what Apple memory you need as all you do is select what Apple computer model (you will still need to know this, at minumum) you need to upgrade and then the memory configuration system returns a list of compatible memory upgrades for your Apple Mac.

[Other World Computing][3] is one of the more mac-specific memory resellers and their website is designed to easily help you find the memory you need. The other vendors tend to use the memory configuarators and  such, which are good but you still need to be able to determine what specific Apple computer you own or want to upgrade memory for.

[Crucial Technology ][4]is another memory store which despite it&#8217;s more corporate feel does offer an Apple Memory Upgrade Tool to help you determine the memory upgrades you need for your Mac.

Both of these memory stores offer a mac specific page or pages dedicated to upgrading the memory and ram on your Apple Computer with ease and make it easy for you to determine what ram to buy for your mac model

No. You do not have to purchase or buy additional memory from Apple.

[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1239" title="Cheapest MacBook Pro 8GB Kits" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-11.02.05-AM1.png" alt="Best 8GB MacBook Pro RAM" width="312" height="296" />][1]

**[Best MacBook Pro Memory][1]**

In fact, I have made an entire **[list of memory upgrade stores][2]** other than Apple that you can safely and easily buy memory upgrades for your Apple Computer that offers a much better value than if you were to buy memory upgrades direct from the manufacturer.

To be sure, buying Apple memory upgrades from Apple directly offers benefits that others on my list can&#8217;t compete with,  and that&#8217;s probably support issues. If you have Apple memory bought from Apple directly and installed (usually at time of your Apple computer purchase) all at the same time there is less of chance of trouble when and if the time comes that you do need support for your Apple computer. If you have Apple memory installed at the factory, Apple cannot use the excuse that your computer problems are due to bad ram from third party memory vendors. The problem with buying memory directly from Apple you will pay dearly for the pleasure when you compare ram prices from Apple against [much cheaper memory][3] upgrade options where you can save up to half price when you compare third party memory to the Apple Memory.

If you stick to a trusted memory store that&#8217;s been in business for over a decade and specializes in Apple ram upgrades you will still get the benefits a ram upgrade can bring but for much less money than had you bought the RAM from Apple directly. Most (actually, all) memory stores I track prices for and monitor offer lifetime warranty and have been in business for at very least, a decade and  in some cases like OWC, over twenty years selling you memory upgrades for your Apple Mac computer regardless of whether you&#8217;re in the market to upgrade an older Mac or maximize the RAM on a new Apple Computer.

Buy RAM from a [trusted memory store][2] and you&#8217;ll save money on your next Apple RAM Upgrade.

It&#8217;s 2011 and most, but not all Apple computers currently shipping today accept the more modern DDR 1333Mhz memory upgrades, at least when it comes to currently shipping desktop computers such as the Apple iMac or Mac Pro. But at the time of writing this the MacBook,  MacBook Pro and Mac Mini Apple computers all still use and require [DDR3 1066MHz memory upgrades][1]:

[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1239" title="Cheapest MacBook Pro 8GB Kits" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-11.02.05-AM1.png" alt="Best 8GB MacBook Pro RAM" width="312" height="296" />][2]

**[Apple 8GB DDR3 SDRAM On Sale][2]**

MacBook Pro DDR3 1066 memory upgrades are priced by memory stores either as [MacBook Pro  memory upgrade kits ][3]or [MacBook Pro memory upgrade modules][4] which are priced individually, but you will need to **upgrade your MacBook Pro** to the maximum 8GB (for current models) in pairs. I track and monitor memory for both as some memory  stores like to sell memory by individual module, while others prefer to offer memory on sale for Apple computers  in memory upgrade kits and sometimes even offer you a bit of a deal when compared against just buying memory individually.

MacBook notebook computers from Apple require the exact same DDR3 1066MHz sodimms as the MacBook Pro&#8217;s but in the case of the MacBooks, you are limited to a maximum of 4GB of RAM when you need to upgrade MacBook memory to the maximum memory to get the most performance out of your Apple computer. And as the MacBook Pro models I mentioned above, you can buy MacBook RAM upgrades as either [MacBook memory modules][5] or [MacBook memory upgrade kits][6].

Apple iMac Models also can accept DDR3 1066 memory as well, but this applies to older iMacs as the current iMac lineup from Apple requires the DDR3 1333MHz memory upgrades. But if you have an [older iMac][7] you can still benefit from a memory upgrade using DDR3 1066Mhz memory upgrades that are sold in either individual [iMac memory][8] or as [iMac memory kits.][9]

DDR3 1066Mhz memory upgrades are cheaper in part than have been in the past due to the fact in part that faster memory upgrades are being introduced to be compatible with the faster Apple computers, but if there ever was a time to buy Apple DDR3 1066MHz RAM this is it, as the early adopters have paid the premium for this type of Apple Memory Upgrade leaving you to save money on Apple DDR3 1066 RAM.
