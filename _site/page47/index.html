<p>The title above sums up what <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="ramseeker">ramseeker</a> does, and in my opinion, does well.</p>

<p>I’m a <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="ram memory price tracker">RAM Memory Price Tracker</a></strong> for deals on ram from reputable third party vendor s and have been tracking ram prices for 14 plus years to date. That’s it, and all I do. I don’t pretend to be an Apple News site or gossip site or even a site on <a href="http://www.dealmac.com" title="apple deals">apple deals</a>, but when it comes to helping you buy the best memory for your Mac at the best price possible this is what I do and all I do.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MX5YWI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001MX5YWI">Crucial 8GB RAM Prices</a></strong></p>

<p>I also don’t list every company claiming to be an expert on memory. With experience comes a bit of knowledge and I know enough not to list every site that sells memory online as all it takes is a domain name and some ram to ship to open an online memory store and start pitching memory upgrades online. Instead I have opted to compare memory prices from a select few memory stores you can actually trust to sell you memory at a fair price and with outstanding support and still help you save money on Apple memory than if you had bought it from Apple directly, which in my opinion is way overpriced for what it is.</p>

<p>I update ram prices daily (if not hourly) so you are sure to get the right price and a fair price on your next ram upgrade from a selection of memory vendors that you can trust to offer excellent support both pre-sale and post-sale. You will also find the lowest prices for memory listed on the front page, because let’s face it – most of you look for the cheapest memory you can buy and no the best overall price but hey, it’s your money – I just help you get a good price on ram upgrades.</p>

<p>I have created a <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com">list of memory stores</a></strong> which will help you when you want to buy memory at a cheap price.</p>

<p>When shopping for Apple Memory, I’m the first to admit that it can be confusing to determine what memory you need to buy for your specific Apple Computer.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MX5YWI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001MX5YWI"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1239" title="Cheapest MacBook Pro 8GB Kits" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-11.02.05-AM1.png" alt="Best 8GB MacBook Pro RAM" width="312" height="296" /></a></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MX5YWI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001MX5YWI">Cheapest 8GB RAM</a></strong></p>

<p>I list memory by model type and then by memory type, so for the current Apple iMac models I list memory like this : <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/iMac_(DDR3_1333)/" title="iMac DDR3 memory">iMac (DDR3 1333)</a>. This means that the memory prices on this page are for iMac and are the newer DDR3 1333Mhz required for the 2010 iMacs. I could list memory prices by year, but this does not work in all cases: 2010 Mac Pros models can accept both DDR3 1066MHz memory as well as DDR3 1333Mhz SDRAM dimms so listing memory by year does not work or apply.</p>

<p>Most memory stores offer either an application that you can download and run for your computer which will tell you what RAM you need, but these tend to be geared towards th PC market over the Mac.  Memory configurators are another easy way to determine what Apple memory you need as all you do is select what Apple computer model (you will still need to know this, at minumum) you need to upgrade and then the memory configuration system returns a list of compatible memory upgrades for your Apple Mac.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.macsales.com" title="memory configurator">Other World Computing</a> is one of the more mac-specific memory resellers and their website is designed to easily help you find the memory you need. The other vendors tend to use the memory configuarators and  such, which are good but you still need to be able to determine what specific Apple computer you own or want to upgrade memory for.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-1548159-10375052">Crucial Technology </a>is another memory store which despite it’s more corporate feel does offer an Apple Memory Upgrade Tool to help you determine the memory upgrades you need for your Mac.</p>

<p>Both of these memory stores offer a mac specific page or pages dedicated to upgrading the memory and ram on your Apple Computer with ease and make it easy for you to determine what ram to buy for your mac model</p>

<p>No. You do not have to purchase or buy additional memory from Apple.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1239" title="Cheapest MacBook Pro 8GB Kits" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-11.02.05-AM1.png" alt="Best 8GB MacBook Pro RAM" width="312" height="296" /></a></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW">Best MacBook Pro Memory</a></strong></p>

<p>In fact, I have made an entire <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com">list of memory upgrade stores</a></strong> other than Apple that you can safely and easily buy memory upgrades for your Apple Computer that offers a much better value than if you were to buy memory upgrades direct from the manufacturer.</p>

<p>To be sure, buying Apple memory upgrades from Apple directly offers benefits that others on my list can’t compete with,  and that’s probably support issues. If you have Apple memory bought from Apple directly and installed (usually at time of your Apple computer purchase) all at the same time there is less of chance of trouble when and if the time comes that you do need support for your Apple computer. If you have Apple memory installed at the factory, Apple cannot use the excuse that your computer problems are due to bad ram from third party memory vendors. The problem with buying memory directly from Apple you will pay dearly for the pleasure when you compare ram prices from Apple against <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="much cheaper memory">much cheaper memory</a> upgrade options where you can save up to half price when you compare third party memory to the Apple Memory.</p>

<p>If you stick to a trusted memory store that’s been in business for over a decade and specializes in Apple ram upgrades you will still get the benefits a ram upgrade can bring but for much less money than had you bought the RAM from Apple directly. Most (actually, all) memory stores I track prices for and monitor offer lifetime warranty and have been in business for at very least, a decade and  in some cases like OWC, over twenty years selling you memory upgrades for your Apple Mac computer regardless of whether you’re in the market to upgrade an older Mac or maximize the RAM on a new Apple Computer.</p>

<p>Buy RAM from a <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com">trusted memory store</a> and you’ll save money on your next Apple RAM Upgrade.</p>

<p>It’s 2011 and most, but not all Apple computers currently shipping today accept the more modern DDR 1333Mhz memory upgrades, at least when it comes to currently shipping desktop computers such as the Apple iMac or Mac Pro. But at the time of writing this the MacBook,  MacBook Pro and Mac Mini Apple computers all still use and require <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="ddr3 1066mhz">DDR3 1066MHz memory upgrades</a>:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1239" title="Cheapest MacBook Pro 8GB Kits" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-11.02.05-AM1.png" alt="Best 8GB MacBook Pro RAM" width="312" height="296" /></a></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW">Apple 8GB DDR3 SDRAM On Sale</a></strong></p>

<p>MacBook Pro DDR3 1066 memory upgrades are priced by memory stores either as <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_Pro_KITS_(1066_DDR3)/" title="macbook pro memory upgrade kits">MacBook Pro  memory upgrade kits </a>or <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_Pro_(1066_DDR3)/" title="macbook pro ram upgrades">MacBook Pro memory upgrade modules</a> which are priced individually, but you will need to <strong>upgrade your MacBook Pro</strong> to the maximum 8GB (for current models) in pairs. I track and monitor memory for both as some memory  stores like to sell memory by individual module, while others prefer to offer memory on sale for Apple computers  in memory upgrade kits and sometimes even offer you a bit of a deal when compared against just buying memory individually.</p>

<p>MacBook notebook computers from Apple require the exact same DDR3 1066MHz sodimms as the MacBook Pro’s but in the case of the MacBooks, you are limited to a maximum of 4GB of RAM when you need to upgrade MacBook memory to the maximum memory to get the most performance out of your Apple computer. And as the MacBook Pro models I mentioned above, you can buy MacBook RAM upgrades as either <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_(1066_DDR3)/">MacBook memory modules</a> or <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_KITS_(1066_DDR3)/">MacBook memory upgrade kits</a>.</p>

<p>Apple iMac Models also can accept DDR3 1066 memory as well, but this applies to older iMacs as the current iMac lineup from Apple requires the DDR3 1333MHz memory upgrades. But if you have an <a href="http://www.lowendmac.com" title="older iMac">older iMac</a> you can still benefit from a memory upgrade using DDR3 1066Mhz memory upgrades that are sold in either individual <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/iMac_(DDR3_1066)/">iMac memory</a> or as <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/iMac_KITS_(DDR3_1066)/" title="imac memory upgrade kits">iMac memory kits.</a></p>

<p>DDR3 1066Mhz memory upgrades are cheaper in part than have been in the past due to the fact in part that faster memory upgrades are being introduced to be compatible with the faster Apple computers, but if there ever was a time to buy Apple DDR3 1066MHz RAM this is it, as the early adopters have paid the premium for this type of Apple Memory Upgrade leaving you to save money on Apple DDR3 1066 RAM.</p>

<p>When shopping for RAM you essentially have two choices when you are wanting to upgrade your computer with ram and memory. It doesn’t matter whether you have a notebook computer or a desktop computer you really only have two decisions to make when you’re ready to buy RAM.</p>

<p>[table id=1 /]<br />

<p><strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com">Do want to save money on RAM? </a></strong></p>

<p>**Do you want to buy the best ram brand you can buy? **</p>

<p>That’s it and under most conditions you can’t  have both. But what you can do is buy generic ram which is the cheaper RAM of the two and is also the ram price I list and track as every visitor to ramseeker is looking to buy the best ram at the best price, so generic it is. This way,  I am comparing prices on ram for the cheapest ram you can buy for your Apple Computer.</p>

<p>If you want to <a href="http://youbuythebest.com">buy the best </a>ram brand, buy the RAM from Apple.  But you’ll pay. Oh boy will you pay… but you do get peace of mind in that the best ram brand will be from the computer manufacturer. In Apple’s case it’s rare that they actually make the RAM so you’re probably buying Apple branded memory as opposed to memory that apple actually makes. My last Macbook came with Samsung memory installed if I recall correctly.</p>

<p>Most memory stores today carry both a cheaper generic ram, which runs fine for most applications and is much  much cheaper memory than the name brand stuff. But for those to drive a mercedes over a chevy, they’re willing to pay for the extra money and buy the name brand memory and the stores I list ram prices for also carry the name brand stuff too.</p>

<p>To summarize, when shopping for RAM you have options. You can <strong><a href="http:///www.ramseeker.com" title="save money on ram">save money on ram</a></strong> and buy the cheap ram or you can spend a little more and buy name brand ram  too.</p>

<p>Ultimately the choice is yours to make.</p>

		<div class="post-content"><p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8IO6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8IO6">Cheapest Apple iMac</a></strong></p>

<p>I’ve just realized that I have been tracking ram prices on <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="imac memory"><strong>iMac Memory</strong></a> for over 13 years now starting with the very first iMac, that teal green model with the round mouse that’s so old now you have to wonder if it’s even worthwhile ugrading thew ram on the original Apple iMac.</p>

<p>I tend to focus on the later iMacs models as I’ve found that’s where the demand is and it only makes sense, I think. Chances are, if you’re going to buy an iMac you’ll want to buy a new iMac as technology marches on and the iMacs just keep getting cheaper and yet better too so it’s my suggestion is when you buy an iMac and maybe it’s for back to school or you’re buying an iMac for Christmas (it’ll be here sooner than you think) and the time to upgrade iMac RAM is right when you buy the iMac.</p>

<p>You can ugrade <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/iMac_(DDR3_1333)/" title="iMac Memory">iMac Memory</a> in one of two ways: The first being to favor simple over cheap and just order your iMac from Apple and max out the iMac RAM from Apple at the same time. If time is money then this is definitely the easiest way to go, as you’re buying an apple product and filling it with apple branded ram at the same time.  The only problem  with this technique is hoo boy, will you pay. Apple RAM has consistently been higher priced than if you bought iMac RAM elsewhere. The savings can be in the hundereds of dollars, especially when you factor in the fact that 16gb of RAM is a lot of RAM for the iMac and it’s a newer technology and we all know the newer bigger ram is the most expensive  RAM you can buy.</p>

<p>The better solution is to buy Apple authorized generic  (or name brand to, but you’ll save less) from memory stores that have been in business for more than a decade and have been selling and suppprting iMac RAM since the beginning of the Apple iMac’s existence.</p>

<p>Heck, even the folks at the Apple Store suggest ramseeker as your destination for RAM because Apple only stocks new and in production products – if you’re looking to uprgrade an older Apple iMac you’re out of luck .</p>

<p>But the good new is new or old Apple iMac, I’ve got a selection of Memory stores that yes, will be happy for your business but actually support and sell memory specific to Apple’s  own memory specifications and the kicker is the iMac RAM from these guys is gauranateed to work!</p>

<p>We all know a gaurantee might not mean much depending on the source but this is just one more reason ramseeker should be your first stop when shoppping for iMac RAM. I don’t list every memory store possible. I only list memory stores that back their product with a gaurantee and have been in business for over a decade (some, two decades) and know RAM for iMacs like the backs of their hands.</p>

<p>That’s how you get the best deal on iMac RAM.  Comparing ram prices from reputable memory stores and buying iMac RAM from a memory store you can trust.</p>

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/macbook_pro"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-386" title="Apple MacBook RAM" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2010-09-28-at-11.06.31-AM.png" alt="Macbook Memory Upgrades" width="478" height="302" /></a>You do know that it’s pretty easy to install the ram you buy from third part memory stores yourself, yes? In fact it’s not too hard at all to <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="install ram macook pro 2010">install RAM in MacBook Pro 2010</a></strong> models at all.</p>

<p>You do need a few things to start, like a clean static free work surface and a small philips screwdriver but other than some time to take your time and go slowly you can install MacBook Pro ram yourself and save yourself any unneccesary installation fee.</p>

<p>In fact, it’s so easy that Apple has <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1270" title="how to install macbook pro ram">instructions on MacBook Pro RAM installations</a> and upgrades so it’s not just due to the fact that I’m familiar with ram upgrades, the good folks at Apple think you’re up to the task too.</p>

<p>The very first thing you need to do is to shut off your computer. Don’t put it to sleep but really shut off your computer. You don’t need anything to be powered up when you’re installing or replacing ram upgrades.</p>

<p>Then you’ll need to close the MacBook Pro and flip the MacBook Pro over and remove the bottom cover with the ten screws that are holding it in place.</p>

<p>Once you’ve got the screws out and put aside safely, you want to be sure to discharge any static electricity build up that might happen by touching something metal on the MacBook Pro.</p>

<p>With the cover off, you’ll see the RAM modules from the factory right there. You don’t have to remove any hard drives or anything. What you do have to do is push the levers that hold the factory ram out so that the memory modules pop out at a 45 degree angle and then slowly remove the ram by pulling lightly the ram out of the memory socket.  Do the same for the bottom ram module too.</p>

<p>Now that you have empty RAM slots you’re ready to install your memory. There’s notches on the ram modules that line up with the memory upgrade sockets, so there’s really no way you can screw this up. With the notches lined up, insert the ram into the memory upgrade slot at about a 45 degree angle. You may have to push a bit as those memory sockets are designed to be a tight fit. Then all you do is push downwards on the ram so that it’s sitting flat an parallel to your desktop and the two little springs should click into place to hold the memory upgrade in.</p>

<p>Then just do the same again for for the second or top memory upgrade socket for the MacBook Pro – line up the notch, install the ram at 45 degrees until the ram is seated in the slot and push down until the two little tabs lock the memory module in place.</p>

<p>Replace the bottom with the ten screws  and you’re done. Turn the MacBook Pro over, press the power button and the operating system will automatically recognize your new maximum ram for MacBook Pro.</p>

<p>If you’re going to go through all the trouble of installing ram yourself, I suggest buying <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_Pro_KITS_(1066_DDR3)/" title="8gb macbook pro ram">8GB MacBook Pro RAM</a></strong> and maxing out the MacBook Pro 2010.</p>

<p>Cheap RAM has to be one of the biggest ways people find ramseeker. They type ‘cheap ram, or cheapest ram, or where can I buy cheap ram and  search engines supply you with an answer: and here you are <img src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p>I know, you’re thinking that there’s lots of stores that advertise the cheapest RAM and at times they do offer the best price on ram (this is assuming you mean best price being equal to lowest price) but I’ve found that for the most part the low price leaders for memory either do one of two things after a while:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The cheapest ram dealers go out of business. I’ve seen it at least a few times. These new vendors come on the market and state total domination but then they realize that they’ve pretty much priced themselves out of the market.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They give up trying to be the lowest price on ram upgrades because sometimes with that also comes the joys of the internet and sometimes the cost of a sale frankly,isn’t worth the effort as margins are cut so low it’s hard to make any money on RAM if you have to answer a million pre-sale and post sale support questions. Sometimes these low price memory stores realize that after a while, it’s best to be priced higher up. Less sales,  perhaps but also less grief and support costs too.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Lastly there’s one more reason why you should make ramseeker your number 1 destination when shopping for memory upgrades. I get special discounts for you that you only can get by shopping through the ramseeker system.  These memory stores can offer a better deal to ramseeker readers because they know they will be rewarded with better sales which makes up for any profit margins they might lose had they not offered the ramseeker memory discount.</p>

<p>With ramseeker you get the best deal on ram upgrades from Memory stores you can trust year after year after year  to help you find the <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="cheapest ram">cheapest ram</a></strong> upgrades for your PC or Mac and the support that you want and expect too.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2010/08/can-the-black-macbook-take-8gb-of-ram/">Can the Black MacBook take 8GB of RAM?</a></h1>

<p><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="black macbook ram">Can the Black MacBook take 8GB of RAM</a>?  The short answer is no, you cannot install 8gb of MacBook RAM into a black macbook, regardless of age. If it’s black, there’s no way  you can install 8GB of RAM into the black notebook from Apple Computer.</p>

<p>Now,  if Apple releases a new black macbook then I’ll have to update this article at a later date and revise my comment above, but for the time being the maximum ram a black macbook can take is up to 4GB of RAM for the later MacBook models.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8IO6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8IO6"><img title="8GB MacBook RAM" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-12.41.00-PM.png" alt="8GB RAM for MacBook" width="312" height="284" /></a></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8IO6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8IO6">8GB MacBook RAM</a></strong></p>

<p>When the black macbooks were first released in 2006 and subsequently 2007, the maximum ram supported by Apple for these MacBooks – both white and black – was a maximum of 2GB of RAM officially supported. But then some third party stores did some testing and found that even though the official maximum RAM for the MacBooks was 2GB this was before 2GB memory for MacBooks was even available so what they found was that even though the official maximum RAM was 2GB you could install 4gb of RAM with 2x2gb memory modules in these early macbook models. The problem  was the OS and  motherboard was only designed to accept up to 3GB tops so even though you could get 4gb of RAM in the MacBooks only 3gb would show up. So if you have an older black macbook, you may be able to get up to 3gb to show up when you buy 2x2gB memory modules for MacBook.</p>

<p>Then with later MacBook models (again, black or white) that were released in 2007 with the faster design and increased standard memory you could now see up to 6GB of RAM in a black notebook from Apple even though again the official stance from Apple was that a maximum 4GB of ram was supported. This in part is again due to the fact that 4gb ram chips for MacBooks came on the scene after the release of the MacBook models in 2007 so at the time 4gb was indeed the maximum ram for your black macbook.  But later tests found that if you installed 4gb in one of the two ram upgrade slots and another 2gb memory module in the second ram slot the macbook could use and recognize all 6gb of installed RAM. Technically, it’s not supported  by Apple but it works.</p>

<p>So although you can’t install 8GB of RAM into a Black MacBook, you may be able to max out your black MacBook RAM with either 2GB or 3GB or 6gb of RAM depending on what specific Macbook model you have.</p>

<p>The folks at OWC have a great resource that explains exactly<a href="http://eshop.macsales.com/shop/memory/MacBook/DDR2/" title="black macbook ram"> how much ram the black macbooks can accept </a>and use. I recommend you refer to it if you have any further questions on upgrading black macbook memory to the maximum allowed.</p>
