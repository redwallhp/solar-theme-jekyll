   <B> <h1><a href="/2012/08/imac-shopping-i5-vs-i7-models/">iMac Shopping: i5 vs i7 models</a></h1></B>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>While we hang around and wait for the 2012 Apple iMacs to show up, I thought I’d take a look at the current offerrings from Apple in the iMac department. I mean, afterall – I do track iMac memory prices – it only makes sense to learn all I can about the 2012 iMac.</p>

<h2 id="the-2012-imac-lineup">The 2012 iMac Lineup</h2>

<p> </p>

<p>Is really, the summer 2011 Apple iMacs as that’s the latest Apple iMac to come out of Apple. Except for MacBook Pro’s we haven’t seen one new computer from Apple this year. But seeing as how these are the best iMacs we’re going to see for a while it looks like, we may as well get to know <a href="http://www.apple.com/imac/">Apple’s best selling Apple Desktop computer. </a></p>

<h2 id="i5-apple-imacs">i5 Apple iMacs</h2>

<p><strong>Apple iMac 21.5 inch 2.5Gz</strong></p>

<p>This iMac is the cheapest Apple iMac you can buy today. Starting at just $1199.00, you get a 2.5Ghz Intel i5 processor, a 500gb hard drive and 4GB of RAM. (add more ram – see the prices to your right)</p>

<p><strong>Apple iMac 21.5 inch 2.7Ghz</strong></p>

<p>If you’ve got a bit more money to spend, it might be worth it to check out the 2.7Ghz i5 iMac. You get more speed, and a bigger 1TB hard drive for $300 more. (I still think the cheaper iMac is the better deal)</p>

<p><strong>Apple iMac 27 inch 2.7Ghz</strong></p>

<p>If I were going to spend any money on an iMac, this is where I would start. The bigger real estate is a welcome addition to my workflow, and the price difference isn’t that bad-you have to find another $500 from the starter iMac but you get a faster processor and 1TB hard drive. You’re paying t a premium for the iMac screen but I think it’s worth the cost</p>

<p><strong>Apple iMac 27 inch 3.1Ghz </strong></p>

<p>Unless you have money  to burn  I would stay away from this model. To me, the biggest iMac isn’t the best deal on an iMac when you compare the 3.1Ghz model to other iMac models in 2012.</p>

<h2 id="i7-apple-imacs">i7 Apple iMacs</h2>

<p>I wish. It turns out, there are no Apple iMacs available yet with faster i7 processors. There’s a complete selection of Apple i5 iMacs from which to choose but nope, no i7 Apple iMacs yet. Again, something to look forward to when Apple finally releases the 2012 Apple iMacs.</p>

   <B> <h1><a href="/2012/08/do-i-need-to-buy-the-macbook-air-with-8gb-of-ram/">Do I Need To Buy The MacBook Air With 8GB of RAM?</a></h1></B>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><div style="float: right; margin-right: 5px;">

</div>

<p>I would buy the 8GB MacBook Air vs the 4GB MacBook Air – finances allowing, of course.</p>

<p>And here’s why: Initially, the 8GB MacBook Air will cost you more money, but over time if you keep your MacBook Air or even sell it down the road you get more value out of a MacBook Air with more ram than you would by buying a MacBook Air with less memory, even though short-term you can save money with a cheaper MacBook Air.</p>

<h2 id="a-8gb-macbook-air-is-a-better-deal">A 8GB Macbook Air is a Better Deal</h2>

<p>Let’s assume you only keep your MacBook Air for two years.</p>

<p>A 4GB MacBook Air costs $1199 for the 13inch MBA, yet the 8GB MacBook Air costs only $100 more bringing the total to $1299.00. That $100 difference is a small price to pay, especially when amortized over 2 years.</p>

<p>4GB MacBook Air – 1200/24 = 50.00 a month</p>

<p>8GB MacBook Air – 1300/24 = $54.17 a month.</p>

<p>For the price of one starbucks latte a month you can get into a MacBook Air with more RAM. Applications are only going to require more ram as browsers get more complicated, facebook starts to display larger photos, or if you’re into photo editing with Apple Aperture like I am you’ll definitely wish you bought the 8GB of RAM.</p>

<p>I would even skimp on hard drive space if I had a choice between buying more ram for my MacBook Air vs adding a bigger SSD storage. You can always add storage later externally. I find I need very little storage when it comes to using my portable computers as all my files are on external drives tethered to my Mac Mini.</p>

<h2 id="sell-the-8gb-macbook-air-for-more-money">Sell The 8GB MacBook Air for More Money</h2>

<p>Resale value is another thing to consider when thinking about buying a brand new MacBook Air. Using my 2 year estimate (at least that’s the amount my wife lets me upgrade – you may be single, or have a larger budget for Apple computers than I do) you’re looking at getting more value from your MacBook Air with more ram than you would with a MacBook Air with just 4GB.</p>

<p>Unlike the Apple MacBook Pro models, where you can add ram later on, the MacBook Air models do not offer a chance to later upgrade the memory so you’d better get your MacBook Air purchase right the first time and buy the MacBook Air with more ram. 8GB of ram in 2012 for the MacBook Air is not a lot of RAM with 16GB starting to be the standard for MacBook notebooks as we enter into 2013.</p>

<p>For the cost of a cup of coffee, I would buy the 8GB MacBook Air over the 4GB MacBook Air as I would find the extra four dollars a month it would cost me to buy the MacBook Air with more RAM.</p>

   <B> <h1><a href="/2012/08/who-has-the-best-pc-memory-finder/">Who Has The Best PC Memory Finder?</a></h1></B>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>If you’re looking to buy RAM for any of the best selling computer brands, one of the easiest ways to get the right ram for your PC is to use what is called a PC Memory Finder. This could also be known as a PC memory configurator, or PC memory helper, or PC Memory Menu even, but essentially a tool to help you decipher memory upgrades, because for folks like you and me, getting the right ram for your Mac or PC can be sometimes tricky.</p>

<h2 id="how-a-pc-memory-finder-works">How a PC Memory Finder Works</h2>

<p>You need to know just three things in order to use a PC Memory Finder and they are:</p>

<p>You computer brand. What brand of computer do you have? Dell? Apple? HP? Sony? Usually you select your computer brand and then continue to the next step.</p>

<p>Your Computer Model or Group. If you have an Apple MacBook Pro you would select MacBook Pro, for instance.</p>

<p>Your Computer Model Number or Name. Because computers come in sooo many sizes and shapes you need to know your computers model number. For Apple, that may be Apple MacBook Pro Retina Display Spring 2012, or a Dell Inspiron N5040, whatever you need to specify exactly what computer you need.</p>

<p>That’s it. Once you have these 3 pieces of information, you’re presented with a list of compatible memory upgrades and usually the vendor’s web page will supply other pertinent information in regards to your specific computer model – like how many memory slots your computer has, or how much the maximum ram your PC can use and recognize.</p>

<p>You then pick the right ram for your PC. I suggest buying the maximum memory for your PC to enhance performance to the maximum.</p>

<h2 id="the-best-pc-memory-finder"><strong>The Best PC Memory Finder</strong></h2>

<p>I like the <a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-1548159-10273954"><strong>PC Memory Finder at Crucial</strong></a> the best out off all the computer memory finders available online – not only do you get name brand memory upgrades with a gaurantee that the ram is the right ram for you computer, you also get recommendations for hard drives compatible with your computer too allowing you to upgrade the hard drive for your PC at the same time. A hard drive and ram upgrade is one way to extend the life of your current computer without having to buy a brand new computer which can be more expensive than upgrading the computer you already have.</p>

These folks have been in the memory upgrade business for some time – at least as long as I have been tracking the best memory upgrade prices and are a reputable computer brand with a guarantee – something important to consider when buying ram because it doesn’t matter what memory brand you buy there’s a good chance, albeit small that due to the sensitive nature of memory upgrades, ram can go bad over time, or even arrive at your door DOA.</p>

   <B> <h1><a href="/2012/08/where-to-buy-memory-cards-for-digital-cameras/">Where To Buy Memory Cards for Digital Cameras</a></h1></B>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p><strong>Memory cards for digital cameras</strong>. If you don’t have one(or more) you are dead in the water and your <a href="http://www.camerahelpers.com" title="best digital camera">fancy digital camera might</a> as well be a door stop, or conversation piece for your coffee table. A digital camera memory card is to a digital camera or DSLR, what a roll of film or kodachrome (RIP) was to film cameras back in the day.</p>

<h2 id="what-kind-of-memory-cards-for-digital-cameras-do-i-need"><strong>What Kind of Memory Cards for Digital Cameras Do I Need? </strong></h2>

<p>For most of us memory cards for cameras in 2012 come in two different forms: compact flash and SDHC memory cards. The former tend to be used with higher end DSLR’s (My Nikon D300 takes compact flash) while the latter is mostly used in compact or more consumer based DSLR’s. One of the benefits of the SDHC cards over the compact flash is that they tend to be more compatible with other devices too and there’s a good chance your notebook Mac or PC will include a SDHC memory card reader built into the notebook, avoiding the need to use or carry an external memory card reader.</p>

<p>There are a few memory card types from Sony that tend to be less mainstream – their memorystick technology never really took the world by storm and it’s too soon to see if the Sony XQD technology will become mainstream. Right now, this is a very expensive memory card.</p>

<h2 id="what-about-memory-card-speed">What About Memory Card Speed?</h2>

<p>Like a lot of things in the technology world – the faster the better, and this applies to memory cards too as the faster the card the faster your camera can write the file to the card and is ready to take the next shot. The last thing you want to do is be left waiting while your memory card writes your file(s) to your memory card. Common speeds are 45Mb/s for SDHC memory cards and 30 to 90 MB/s for compact flash memory cards.</p>

<h2 id="what-size-of-memory-card-should-i-buy-for-my-digital-camera">What Size of Memory Card Should I Buy For My Digital Camera?</h2>

<p>I like to buy the biggest memory card I can buy for the best price I can find online. This may require some time and patience but you can get some really good deals on camera memory if you shop around. I tend to shoot JPEG vs RAW so my space requirements are much less than a RAW shooter with a high megapixel digital camera. I have an 8GB card in my Nikon D300 that’s been just fine for years, and I have never run out of room.</p>

<h2 id="where-to-buy-memory-cards-for-digital-cameras"><strong>Where To Buy Memory Cards for Digital Cameras </strong></h2>

<p>I like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/mn/search/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;bbn=516866&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;keywords=memory%20card&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;qid=1345744164&amp;rh=n%3A172282%2Cn%3A!493964%2Cn%3A541966%2Cn%3A172456%2Cn%3A516866%2Ck%3Amemory%20card&amp;tag=ramseeker-20"><strong>Amazon for lots of memory cards</strong></a> due to the fact that I have an Amazon Prime membership, so shipping is fast and free, but you should also check <a href="http://www.adorama.com/?&amp;KBID=64104"><strong>Adorama</strong></a> and<a href="http://www.bhphotovideo.com/?BI=8956&amp;KBID=10401&amp;DFF=d10-v1-t8-x4">** B+H**</a> for Digital Camera memory cards too as they often feature deals on memory cards as well from time to time too.</p>

   <B> <h1><a href="/2012/08/when-will-the-2012-mac-mini-release-date-be/">When Will The 2012 Mac Mini Release Date Be?</a></h1></B>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>I am writing this on a** 2011 Apple Mac Mini<strong>. It’s the higher end model, and my wife works with the l</strong>ower end model too<strong>. We’re a Mac Mini family. But both of these apple Mac Minis were released in 2011, not this year – and that means they are a year old now, <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/is-applecare-for-a-2011-macbook-pro-worth-it/" title="Is AppleCare Worth It for A MacBook Pro?">out of warranty</a> and slowly becoming obsolete. We would love to buy new Apple Mac Mini’s but there’s one problem. Apple has not released them yet. The only brand new Apple computer we have seen is the **MacBook Pro Retina</strong> display, and even that model is a few months old now</p>

<h2 id="when-i-think-the-mac-mini-release-date-will-be"><strong>When I think the Mac Mini Release Date Will Be</strong></h2>

<p>The Apple Mac Mini is one of the more popular computers due to the fact that they are the cheapest Apple Mac you can buy. They are not the Apple computer under $500, but they are close. If you shop around you can buy a Mac Mini for a small discount  – about $35.00 on <strong>Amazon</strong>, <strong>MacMall</strong> or** Best Buy** for even less than the Apple Store charges. And speaking of the Apple Store, one way to get a cheap Mac Mini is to check the <a href="http://store.apple.com/us/browse/home/specialdeals/mac/mac_mini"><strong>refurbished Apple Mac Mini section</strong></a> on the Apple Store online. It’s hit and miss with stock, but if you’re willing to wait this is the only way to buy a Mac under $500.00.</p>

<p>Another reason for the popularity of the Mac MIni is the fact that these make excellent home theater or audio servers. You don’t need fancy software of any kind. All you need is the free iTunes and some sort of wireless connector for your TV or stereo – usually in the form of an <strong>airport express</strong> or <strong>Apple TV</strong>. You don’t need a monitor once you’ve got the Mac Mini set up for serving your movie and music files and you can control the Mac Mini via your Apple iPhone thanks to the free Apple remote software.</p>

<p>All this said, there’s more than one computer from Apple we’re waiting for we haven’t seen a release date for the iMac either yet, or the Mac Pro yet too. All the rumors for the Mac Pro seem to state 2013 for it, but we could see a brand new <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/when-will-the-imac-2012-release-date-be/" title="When Will The iMac 2012 Release Date Be?">Apple iMac release as early as September 2012.</a> We’re already into the end of August, so that doesn ‘t leave much time and Apple usually refreshes the iPod line in the fall too to grab a good share of the holiday shopping season. We might even see an iPad 4 by the end of the year too.</p>

<p>So when to squeeze a Mac Mini release into all that? The Mac Mini would be a better choice than a new iMac release due to the cost and use as a media servier so I think that this will come first. When, I have no idea but my guess would be either late fall or early in January 2013 we should see a faster processor (probably the same as the MacBook Pro’s) and probably a ram increase too to <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/mac-mini-ddr3-memory-upgrade-prices/">8GB of RAM</a> with a maximum of 16GB for the Mac Mini instead of the current 8GB maximum Apple recommends.</p>

<p>Of course, I could be wrong with all of this and Apple could wait until later in 2013 and continue to sell the best selling computer in their lineup, the MacBook Pro and MacBook Air, as these are 2012 Apple computers already. Like a lot of things in life, only time will tell <strong>when the final release date for the Apple Mac Mini</strong> will be.</p>

   <B> <h1><a href="/2012/08/what-is-the-least-expensive-nikon-full-frame-camera/">What is the Least Expensive Nikon Full Frame Camera?</a></h1></B>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>If you’re shooting any type of full frame lenses, your best bet is to shoot with a full frame camera vs a DX camera – especially if you’re shooting wide angle lenses and want to take advantage of their perspective and large viewing angle. On full frame cameras, the wide angles can really sing in getting you great photos whether you are shooting landscapes or group photos or perhaps you just want to get a different view on the world – shooting wide angle lenses allows you to do it.</p>

<p>If you’re shooting longer lenses, or even normal lenses on DX cameras like the Nikon D7000 for example, understand that any Nikon lens you mount on a Nikon DX camer will multiply the focal length by 1.5x. Your 35mm 1.8 becomes a 52mm 1.8 – In a way this is great because you now have a<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/nikon-afs-nikkor-35mm-f1-8-dx-g-review-and-best-prices/" title="Nikon AFS Nikkor 35mm f/1.8 DX G Review and Best Prices."> very fast normal lens for under $200</a>, and if you shoot longer telephotos – they really help you extend your reach – great for shooting sports or birds when you can’t get close to the action.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0076AYNXM/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0076AYNXM&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=ramseeker-20"><img class="size-full wp-image-6174 alignleft" title="Best full frame nikon camera" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Screen-Shot-2012-08-23-at-9.31.50-AM.png" alt="cheapest full frame Nikon camera" width="291" height="298" /></a></p>

<p><strong>The Advantages of Full Frame Cameras</strong></p>

<p>The advantage of full frame cameras usually come in the terms of image quality. Because a full frame or FX camera’s sensor is bigger the images tend to be more natural because you’re not cramming as much pixels into such a small space. For me, the advantages of full frame are the wide angle lens use, but there’s ways around it by buying DX wide angle lenses but even at 18mm wide you may not find that wide enough. I would much prefer to shoot with my Nikon 20mm f/2.8 at 20mm than an 18-55 DX lens where the math works out to a 28mm focal length.</p>

<p><strong>The Cheapest Nikon Full Frame Camera</strong></p>

<p>For Nikon shooters, we currently have two options if you want to shoot in full frame, and that comes in the form of the Nikon D800 or Nikon D700.</p>

<p>The Nikon D700 is the cheaper of the two with a street price of about $2200. This is a four year old camera though and offers the technology that was the best at the time with 12 megapixels of resolution, outstanding low light performance and 51 point autofocus system.

<p>The Nikon D800 is the much newer full frame camera from Nikon and offers much higher resolution – almost 3x as much at 36MP, faster processors, and much newer technology than the much older Nikon D700. You’ll pay a premium for this though with a street price for the Nikon D800 of about $3000.00 online.

<p>At the current time, the cheapest Nikon full frame camera is the Nikon D700. Is it worth it to skip the Nikon D700 and go to the Nikon D800? One question you have to ask yourself is do you shoot video, or are you planning to? The Nikon D700 does not offer HD video shooting while the Nikon D800 does. In my mind, this is the major difference between the Nikon D700 and Nikon D800 and depending on your answer the price you pay for the Nikon D800 – even though you may end up paying more for it than the Nikon D700 might be worth it.</p>

   <B> <h1><a href="/2012/08/what-is-the-best-sony-5-1-receiver-price/">What is the Best Sony 5.1 Receiver Price?</a></h1></B>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>Sony receivers for both home theater use and even stereo listening can be great bargains, if you shop around and analyze your needs on what you plan on using the 5.1 receiver for. All come with a plethora of features that include several audio and video inputs, HDMI in and out, and a stereo tuner for AM and FM listening. Of course, being a 5.1 receiver from Sony, that means there are also front speakers, a center speaker and surround speaker connectors to. You’ll need to buy your speakers for your sony receiver separately, and there’s too many options to list here today. But, let’s look at a few Sony 5.1 Receivers and their prices. One of these should be the best Sony receiver for you.</p>

<p>#</p>

<h1 id="sony-strdh520-71-channel-3d-av-receiver">Sony STRDH520 7.1 Channel 3D AV Receiver</h1>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006U1VGQU/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B006U1VGQU&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=ramseeker-20"><img class="size-full wp-image-6169 alignleft" title="best sony receiver" alt="cheapest sony receiver" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Screen-Shot-2012-08-23-at-8.05.56-AM.png" width="461" height="356" /></a></p>

<p>This Sony is a 7.1 vs 5.1 receiver, but don’t worry about that as all this means is there are an extra set of surround speaker connectors on the back of the receiver, and you don’t need to use them if you don’t need or want to. This is one of the best selling home theater receivers under $300 and definitely worth consideration thanks to it’s impressive feature set:</p>

<ul>
  <li>100 watts per channel for all seven channels.</li>
  <li>6 HD connections. Four are HDMI and 2 component video</li>
  <li>3D Pass Thru</li>
  <li>HD Digital Cinema Sound</li>
  <li>Dolby TrueHD, Pro logic IIz and dts HD enhanced audio codecs</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a full featured receiver for both audio and HT from Sony, and the best part is all this<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004NHCGJO/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004NHCGJO&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=ramseeker-20">** only costs a little over $200. **</a></p>

<p>But what if you need more features and want to spend a little more money for a Sony receiver to get those features? The Sony mentioned above might be the best budget receiver from Sony, but it may not be the best overall deal. Sometimes, it’s best to spend a bit more money on a Sony receiver.</p>

<h1 id="sony-strdh830-sony-3d-71-channel-av-receiver">Sony STRDH830 Sony 3D 7.1 Channel A/V Receiver</h1>

<p>This Sony <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006U1VGQU/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B006U1VGQU&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=ramseeker-20"><strong>will cost you a bit more money</strong></a>, double in fact compared to the cheaper STRDH5220 above, but you get one important feature that I think every receiver for 2012 should have, and that’s iPod connectivity. The Apple iPod has become the defacto standard when it comes to portable music, but when you’re at home or office you want to listen to something with a little more oooph, and the Sony receiver above offers that in spades and will sound much better than the Apple earbuds that came with your Apple iPod.</p>

<p>The best part? This Sony receiver even includes an Apple iPod dock, unlike some other brands that force you to buy an iPod dock for your stereo or home theater receiver separately. This is the perfect marriage between the two biggest electronics companies in the world today.</p>

<p>Besides the fact that you can use the iPod with this receiver, the Sony STRDH830 also offers more power (140 watts, instead of 100 watts), another HDMI input (5 vs 4), the ability to upscale analog video to 1080i, an advanced on-screen digital display, Digital audio calibration for perfect sound from all your speakers, and Bravia sync so you only need one remote control when used in conjunction with your Sony Bravia HDTV.</p>

<p>Overall, I think that this is the much better value receiver from the two. Yes, you pay more up front, but the higher end Sony includes an iPod dock, and connectivity options, and I know for me, that’s worth much much more than the minimal increase in cost.</p>
