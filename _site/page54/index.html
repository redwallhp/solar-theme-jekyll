You&#8217;re here at this page because you want to do one thing: Buy Apple RAM Memory for Cheap.

But this does not mean that you dear reader, are cheap. No no no, this just means that you want to buy memory at the best price you can from a reputable store that offers free shipping, hassle free warranty and knows Apple Memory and RAM inside and out. With new Apple Models comign out from Apple all the time you know that after spending all that money on a new Mac computer, it only makes sense to buy memory from memory stores that support you and also the mac community.

**[<img title="Cheap Apple Memory" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-8.33.14-PM.png" alt="Best Priced Apple RAM" width="525" height="282" />][1]**

**[Apple Memory Under $100][1]**

<div>
</div>

Sure, you could buy ram from some generic computer store but these guys are just moving boxes for the most part. They have no idea about the individual apple computer or what memory your mac takes, and there&#8217;s a real good chance they don&#8217;t even care. This is why you want to buy apple ram from apple authorized memory stores that support the  Apple community, because believe it or not, we&#8217;re all in this together. yes, that means you with the apple logo shaved into the back of your head.

And this is why I only  list the best memory for Apple from the best stores for Apple Memory: The ones that specialize in Apple Memory and not much else. Vendors like Crucial,  OWC, MemoryX, 1-800-4-Memory , RAMJET  just to name a few. We&#8217;re  talking years and years of  experience of making memory (yes, that&#8217;s right, they actually make the ram to precise apple specifications) just for your new or old Mac so that it will run the fastest it possibly can but without any startup issues or crashes due to buying bad ram.

If you&#8217;re looking for Cheap RAM, stop.  Pay a few dollars more (we&#8217;re talking less than a coffee at starbucks here for most memory stores)  and  buy ram that&#8217;s not cheap, but is good. In fact, it&#8217;s great.

I know my time is important to me, so that&#8217;s why when I upgrade my apple computer,  I **buy the best ram at the best price **I can find  from a memory store I can trust and then, I&#8217;m done.

When shopping for ram or memory upgrades for the Apple MacBooks that released earlier this year in 2010 you don&#8217;t need to really worry about what the fastest ram is. Speed, really isn&#8217;t the issue here. Yes, it has to be DDR3 1066 SDRAM but there&#8217;s no fast ram or slow ram for the new Apple Macbooks.

[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1388" title="Cheapest Appel MacBook Pro" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-8.36.11-PM.png" alt="Best Price on new macbook pro" width="525" height="299" />][1]

**[Best MacBook Pro Prices][1]**

In fact, there&#8217;s no Apple RAM, as long as the memory is certified to be compatible with Apple, you&#8217;re good.

I&#8217;d be much more concerned about two things when shopping for Apple MacBook Pro RAM:

1. Price.

2. Customer  Service.

Some days, you&#8217;ll luck out and get the best  of both worlds, and  if you do buy from any of the [Apple Memory Stores ][2]I list you&#8217;ll do just fine in both regards. Every memory store I list has been with me for way longer than the MacBook Pro has been around, so you&#8217;re sure to get good customer service and a fair price from any vendor.

That said, don&#8217;t be surprised that like all things in life, you get what you pay for and the lowest price might not be the best deal sometimes. (Not always but it happens)

The memory stores that always offer the lowest prices on RAM do so because  they&#8217;re hoping for volume. If they sell 100 orders a day and make a dollar each, they&#8217;ve profited $100. But  they have to deal with 100 different  customers. Customers that are more concerned about price than service a lot of times and don&#8217;t care that the memory takes longer to ship, or that the store&#8217;s lifetime warranty might not be up to snuff. He&#8217;s a busy man &#8211; he&#8217;s got 100 cheap customers to ship ram to today.

In contrast let&#8217;s take the memory vendor that offers ram for a few dollars more. Because he&#8217;s making ten dollars on each sale, he (or she) makes only ten sales to reach  that hundred dollars. This store is happy to to make less, but not have to deal with the more price concious consumers. Because vendor B only has ten orders to ship, they&#8217;re more than willing to help you troubleshoot, answer pre-order questions or hold your hand along the way and offers support if you need it.

I list both at ramseeker and always have &#8211; and have never promoted the lowest price. I allow you to chose  which is more important to you: low price or better service

Again you lucked out, and I don&#8217;t list any stores that don&#8217;t specialize in memory upgrades and have watched more than one low price leader go the way of the dodo bird over the years.

So when I get questions on what is the fastest ram or what is the best ram, I always say: Pick the price and store that you like and order ram from any of the memory stores I list and you will be happy with your memory purchase.

   <B> <h1><a href="/2010/04/what-does-upgrading-imac-memory-cost/">What does upgrading iMac Memory Cost?</a></h1></B>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content">[table id=2 /]

The prices, or costs for the different Apple iMac Models and memory upgrades over the years have changed as new technology has been introduced, which results in new Apple Mac Memory being needed depending on what model of iMac you plan to upgrade with more memory.

**[Cheapest Apple iMacs][1]**

The latest iMacs released in 2008 and 2009 require the use of DDR3 1066 SDRAM so-dimms, and depending on the particular iMac you have you can upgrade to either 4gb or 8gb of ram for the newer, modern iMacs.  About a year ago when the newest iMac models at the time were released &#8211; 8gb of ram for the iMacs would cost as much as the computer itself. 8GB memory kits, especially when you bought them from the Apple Store directly were prohibitively expensive at prices hovering around the $1000 mark for an 8GB iMac ram upgrade kit.

**iMac Prices Have Dropped**

Thanks to more demand of the 8GB memory kits  the prices have dropped considerably when you want to buy two 4 gig memory modules and install them in your new Apple iMac. Now (spring 2010), **the cost to max out your iMac and fill it with ram is a much more reasonable cost of about $350-400.**

The 4GB memory upgrades from Apple have even dropped recently, so though it still costs more to upgrade your iMac when you[ buy ram directly from Apple][2], it&#8217;s a possibility now as the prices, while still more than if you bought the ram from a third party memory shop, is priced more reasonably than before. But you&#8217;ll still pay about a $100-200 price for the Apple RAM over the same ram when bought elsewhere.

The 4GB RAM and memory modules (1066 DDR3)  are still pricier than their smaller sized memory chips. If you can get away with it, you might be able to **[save][3]** **[some money on iMac ram][3]** by not maxing out your current Apple iMac and just upgrading to 4GB with 2&#215;2 memory modules as the 2GB ram is still priced much lower than the 4gb module. It would make sense that if a 2gb module costs $1, than a 4GB memory upgrade would be priced at $2, but not so. At time of writing this, 2GB RAM for iMacs costs about $44.00, while the 4GB RAM for Apple iMacs cost 4x as much with street prices being in the $175-200 range from most stores.

It really is up to you to decide what the best ram upgrade option is for your iMac. If you can afford to, and justify **the cost an 8GB iMac upgrade makes the most sense** as you will get the fastest speed from your iMac. But if money is a factor, you should work  with the 4GB upgrade kit. **4gb of RAM is more than enough memory** for the tasks suited to the iMac, such as web browsing, email  and using the iLife software that came with your Apple iMac.

If you need any help with **RAM upgrades for your iMac,** I&#8217;m more than happy to help.

		<div class="post-content">[iMac RAM][1], or iMac Memory if you prefer, comes in many different memory configurations and specifications over the years as Apple has elected to keep the iMac monitor regardless of processor or even design changes, as soon as the last model is replaced with a new model, the new model is called iMac and is the older iMac model. As far as apple is concerned, an iMac is whatever th e most current version of the iMac Family.

**[Cheap Apple iMac Prices][2]**

**iMac Names **

Sometimes to avoid confusion, Apple will add a description to their iMacs such as iMac Intel i5 processor, or iMac G5 , or even iMac 27 inch. Some way to differentiate between the many iMac models. But for the most part, and especially when marketing Apple&#8217;s consumer based all in one desktop computer. Then it&#8217;s just iMac. But when you&#8217;re shopping for an iMac from even the apple store or amazon or looking up info in the apple knowledgebase the iMac model is usually specified by some name other than just iMac.

**[iMac Memory ][3]**

When it comes down to iMac Memory, and when there was only the first iMac available, things were pretty easy  &#8211;  I created a page specifically for iMac RAM, and didnt&#8217; do much planning for future iMacs to be honest. And then Apple went and released the slot loading iMac and now I had to differentiate between the two iMac models as they now take different memory. But, as there was only two different iMac models at the time I still, just made another page and called it iMac 350 to 500, or something along those lines.

Apple went  and really put the kinks into my plans when they released the iMac Flat Panel models as then I had to not only track the lowest price, but there was two different types of RAM &#8211; one slot was user accessible yet the other slot you had to take your iMac into an apple certified repair center to get the other ram slot upgraded (what a stupid system, eh?). But still, there&#8217;s only 3 iMacs so I just made a new page to track the new ram that these new iMacs came with (pc133 sodimms) and i created a page called PC133. The Flat Panel iMacs release is when I had to rethink for future iMacs as I realized that this was the future, and apple would once release new computers that were new iMacs and completely different than their predecessors, yet would be named just iMac.

With the release of the new Flat Panel iMacs that took PC2100 DDR sdram sodimms, I would just name the model and then (usually in brackets) I would put the memory type to differentiate the different iMac models.

I continue with this naming strategy, up to and including the iMacs with Intel i5 processors as these models take DDR3 1066 SDRAM  so the pages are named in the format of: Model Name (Memory Type) for the current and all iMac models.

The only downside for this system is that you have to know what memory type you need to take full advantage. I have tried to make things easier for you by separating the pull down menu so that I list current apple models first, and then list the older discontinued models.

If you need any help with iMac RAM you can feel free to contact me and I will be glad to help you get the right memory for your iMac at the best price.

I have specialized in Apple Memory for over 13 years and have tracked memory prices for each and every mac made since about 1997, starting with the Beige PowerMac G3 desktops and working all the way through iBooks, iMacs and PowerBook and MacBook Pro RAM.

So today I thought I&#8217;d start with a little primer on the what apple ram you need for your mac computer. Now I realize that there&#8217;s very little demand for older mac memory as its&#8217; been my personal experience to upgrade my computer when I buy it to the fullest capacity over the years and then just forget about it. But if you&#8217;ve got an older Mac Computer you want to upgrades &#8211; maybe it&#8217;s a hand me down, or a hobby project, or maybe you just need a cheap computer for some word processing tasks, then older macs are still a very viable solution. You don&#8217;t need to spend thousands of dollars on a new MacBook Pro if all you&#8217;re doing is some email and web work. A used Macbook would do you quite nicely. But regardless of the model of older mac computer you end up buying you can still get a good deal more use out of it if you buy some more memory. Especially on the older Macs &#8211; adding more ram or adding a bigger hard drive can mean a world of difference in performance.

**[Beige Desktop G3 RAM][1]**

The memory on the beige G3&#8217;s can run 256mb memory modules and you can still buy 256mb ram for beige G3&#8217;s for just $15. The memory you need for this computer is PC100 SDRAM

**[Blue and white PowerMac G3][2]**

It seems just like yesterday that these were released with their cool  iMac inspired color schemes and cool handles to carry them and the nifty way the entire side of the computer swings out for easy ram upgrades. These will accept 256mb memory upgrades that cost as little as $15 these days.

**[PowerMac G4 PC100][3]**

These  PowerMac  G4&#8217;s used pretty much the same case as the Blue and White PowerMac G3&#8217;s but that&#8217;s where the difference ended for these computers. PC100 SDRAM is used in these models, regardless whether you had the &#8216;yikes&#8217; version or the AGP video card version. These accepted 512mb  which is now priced at $23 and up.

These 3 desktop  computers from Apple are just a few of the older mac computers I still track and monitor memory prices for. Even though these discontinued Macs are deemed obsolete by today&#8217;s standards, if you fill them with RAM and upgrade the hard drives they can still be considered great little computers for email or word processing.

PC memory has really dropped in prices over the last few years. Ten years ago, 1GB of [RAM for a PC ][1]would have cost over two thousand dollars when it was first released.  It has been my experiences that the price of ram just keeps getting cheaper and cheaper until demand for the memory starts to dwindle due to new technologies being released over time and  the older ram usally rises in price a small percentage as the demand drops.

[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1372" title="Best Selling Apple Desktop" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-8.18.44-PM.png" alt="Cheap Desktop Computers" width="475" height="228" />][2]

**[Best Selling PC: Apple Mac Mini][2]**

**It doesn&#8217;t matter what ram costs**

[table id=7 /]

<div>
</div>

Regardless of whether you are buying a PC  or Apple computer, or perhaps you&#8217;re creating a new PC from scratch  and you need ram it is always best to buy the most ram  you can afford as the benefits far outweigh the costs.

For example 8GB 1066 DDR3 memory (also known as DDR3 PC8500) is priced still pretty expensively. Not as much as a year ago, where it would cost you over a thousand dollars for this memory configuration, but enough still today that 8G of DDR3 will cost in the $400 to $500 price range.

If you can do with smaller amounts of ram, 1GB of  DDR3 ram for PC&#8217;s  costs under $20. The ram prices for 1GB have risen in recent months down from a low of $11.00 for 1GB  of RAM. If you need more than 1GB of memory, the 2GB RAM for most desktop and laptop PC computers costs just $40 or so, which is another bargain. If you&#8217;ve been paying attention this works out to double what the 1GB RAM costs so you will still be getting a bargain.

It&#8217;s only when you get into either exotic memory types (such as RAMBUS or RDRAM) or larger sizes, where the technology and demand haven&#8217;t met up yet for the sweet spot of memory upgrade and low price &#8211; is where you&#8217;ll get bitten for a high ram price.

The 2Gb memory size at the time being seems to be the best size of memory module for your PC computer &#8211; it doesn&#8217;t matter  &#8211; desktop or notebook computers. On notebook computers you are usually physically limited  due to size and also heat  on how much ram you can install in a netbook or notebook computer. On a desktop computer your ram upgrade options are usually much more as you have more ram slots to install memory into and so on most PC&#8217;s you can use cheap ram with small sizes to save money on ram upgrades.

Your PC manufacturer will be able  to help you with how much RAM you can install and what type of ram you need, but when yo have this information at your arsenal you can upgrade the memory to the maximum.[ RAM is cheap][3]. Max out the ram on your PC and you can enjoy years of trouble free computing.

It has been my policy  to always monitor **[apple memory][1]** prices that are generic, as my thinking is this:  Generic is the best memory you can buy if you want to save money on ram, be it for apple, dell, hp or sony computers. But with the recent decrease in memory prices over the years this has made me re-think my stand. You might be able to get into brand name memory for just a few dollars more.

# Best Apple MacBook Pro RAM


**[Cheapest Apple MacBook Pro for 2011][2]**

**The Difference Between Generic and Brand Name Memory Upgrades**

First off, there&#8217;s the price. Generic memory is cheaper, no doubt and it&#8217;s made and manufactured to the same standards as the name brand ram but there&#8217;s no fancy logo on the generic ram, it&#8217;s made and assembled with parts that are, well, generic.

Brand name on the  hand is supplied by brand name manufacturers such as crucial technology, samsung, or micron (which manufactures memory for crucial technolog. With brand name, you&#8217;re paying for an established memory brand as opposed to a memory store that sticks their sticker on generic ram.

The difference is small, but the brand name ram might be a better option if your life depends on your memory working  100 percent all the time and any downtime would cost you a substantial amount of money. This isn&#8217;t  to say the generic memory isn&#8217;t&#8217; good and reliable, and if you buy it from the memory stores I recommend such as [RAMJET][3], [Crucial][4],  or [18004memory][5] to name few memory stores, they back up the ram with their warranty and all these stores have been in business for over ten years at very least, some are closer to 20 years experience. They wouldn&#8217;t be in business that long if they sold bad ram.

The **best memory for Apple** is what you can afford and value. If you appreciate the brand name memory, then buy the name brand ram. If you think ram is ram is ram, then save money on ram and buy the generic ram.

Which ever **method** you choose when deciding what is the best memory for your mac, do yourself a favor and upgrade your apple computer to the maximum ram that your machine can allow as that will boost your performance of the computer you spent a lot of money on. Don&#8217;t be cheap on ram. Buy as much as you can afford, and your apple computer will accomodate. This one upgrade will offer you the most benefit when it comes to having a reliable computer that runs without any hiccups or service requirements.
