<p>I have specialized in Apple Memory for over 13 years and have tracked memory prices for each and every mac made since about 1997, starting with the Beige PowerMac G3 desktops and working all the way through iBooks, iMacs and PowerBook and MacBook Pro RAM.</p>

<p>So today I thought I’d start with a little primer on the what apple ram you need for your mac computer. Now I realize that there’s very little demand for older mac memory as its’ been my personal experience to upgrade my computer when I buy it to the fullest capacity over the years and then just forget about it. But if you’ve got an older Mac Computer you want to upgrades – maybe it’s a hand me down, or a hobby project, or maybe you just need a cheap computer for some word processing tasks, then older macs are still a very viable solution. You don’t need to spend thousands of dollars on a new MacBook Pro if all you’re doing is some email and web work. A used Macbook would do you quite nicely. But regardless of the model of older mac computer you end up buying you can still get a good deal more use out of it if you buy some more memory. Especially on the older Macs – adding more ram or adding a bigger hard drive can mean a world of difference in performance.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/Power_Mac_G3_(Beige)/" title="Beige Desktop G3 RAM">Beige Desktop G3 RAM</a></strong></p>

<p>The memory on the beige G3’s can run 256mb memory modules and you can still buy 256mb ram for beige G3’s for just $15. The memory you need for this computer is PC100 SDRAM</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/Power_Mac_G3_(Blue_White)/">Blue and white PowerMac G3</a></strong></p>

<p>It seems just like yesterday that these were released with their cool  iMac inspired color schemes and cool handles to carry them and the nifty way the entire side of the computer swings out for easy ram upgrades. These will accept 256mb memory upgrades that cost as little as $15 these days.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/Power_Mac_G4_(PC100)/" title="powermac g4 memory">PowerMac G4 PC100</a></strong></p>

<p>These  PowerMac  G4’s used pretty much the same case as the Blue and White PowerMac G3’s but that’s where the difference ended for these computers. PC100 SDRAM is used in these models, regardless whether you had the ‘yikes’ version or the AGP video card version. These accepted 512mb  which is now priced at $23 and up.</p>

<p>These 3 desktop  computers from Apple are just a few of the older mac computers I still track and monitor memory prices for. Even though these discontinued Macs are deemed obsolete by today’s standards, if you fill them with RAM and upgrade the hard drives they can still be considered great little computers for email or word processing.</p>

<p>PC memory has really dropped in prices over the last few years. Ten years ago, 1GB of <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/pc/" title="ram for pc">RAM for a PC </a>would have cost over two thousand dollars when it was first released.  It has been my experiences that the price of ram just keeps getting cheaper and cheaper until demand for the memory starts to dwindle due to new technologies being released over time and  the older ram usally rises in price a small percentage as the demand drops.</p>

<p><strong>It doesn’t matter what ram costs</strong></p>

<p>[table id=7 /]</p>

<div>
</div>

<p>Regardless of whether you are buying a PC  or Apple computer, or perhaps you’re creating a new PC from scratch  and you need ram it is always best to buy the most ram  you can afford as the benefits far outweigh the costs.</p>

<p>For example 8GB 1066 DDR3 memory (also known as DDR3 PC8500) is priced still pretty expensively. Not as much as a year ago, where it would cost you over a thousand dollars for this memory configuration, but enough still today that 8G of DDR3 will cost in the $400 to $500 price range.</p>

<p>If you can do with smaller amounts of ram, 1GB of  DDR3 ram for PC’s  costs under $20. The ram prices for 1GB have risen in recent months down from a low of $11.00 for 1GB  of RAM. If you need more than 1GB of memory, the 2GB RAM for most desktop and laptop PC computers costs just $40 or so, which is another bargain. If you’ve been paying attention this works out to double what the 1GB RAM costs so you will still be getting a bargain.</p>

<p>It’s only when you get into either exotic memory types (such as RAMBUS or RDRAM) or larger sizes, where the technology and demand haven’t met up yet for the sweet spot of memory upgrade and low price – is where you’ll get bitten for a high ram price.</p>

<p>The 2Gb memory size at the time being seems to be the best size of memory module for your PC computer – it doesn’t matter  – desktop or notebook computers. On notebook computers you are usually physically limited  due to size and also heat  on how much ram you can install in a netbook or notebook computer. On a desktop computer your ram upgrade options are usually much more as you have more ram slots to install memory into and so on most PC’s you can use cheap ram with small sizes to save money on ram upgrades.</p>

<p>Your PC manufacturer will be able  to help you with how much RAM you can install and what type of ram you need, but when yo have this information at your arsenal you can upgrade the memory to the maximum.<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="ram is cheap"> RAM is cheap</a>. Max out the ram on your PC and you can enjoy years of trouble free computing.</p>

<p>It has been my policy  to always monitor <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="apple memory">apple memory</a></strong> prices that are generic, as my thinking is this:  Generic is the best memory you can buy if you want to save money on ram, be it for apple, dell, hp or sony computers. But with the recent decrease in memory prices over the years this has made me re-think my stand. You might be able to get into brand name memory for just a few dollars more.</p>

<h1 id="best-apple-macbook-pro-ram">Best Apple MacBook Pro RAM</h1>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I">Cheapest Apple MacBook Pro for 2011</a></strong></p>

<p><strong>The Difference Between Generic and Brand Name Memory Upgrades</strong></p>

<p>First off, there’s the price. Generic memory is cheaper, no doubt and it’s made and manufactured to the same standards as the name brand ram but there’s no fancy logo on the generic ram, it’s made and assembled with parts that are, well, generic.</p>

<p>Brand name on the  hand is supplied by brand name manufacturers such as crucial technology, samsung, or micron (which manufactures memory for crucial technolog. With brand name, you’re paying for an established memory brand as opposed to a memory store that sticks their sticker on generic ram.</p>

<p>The difference is small, but the brand name ram might be a better option if your life depends on your memory working  100 percent all the time and any downtime would cost you a substantial amount of money. This isn’t  to say the generic memory isn’t’ good and reliable, and if you buy it from the memory stores I recommend such as <a href="http://www.ramjet.com" title="ramjet memory">RAMJET</a>, <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">Crucial</a>,  or <a href="http://18004memory.com" title="18004memory">18004memory</a> to name few memory stores, they back up the ram with their warranty and all these stores have been in business for over ten years at very least, some are closer to 20 years experience. They wouldn’t be in business that long if they sold bad ram.</p>

<p>The <strong>best memory for Apple</strong> is what you can afford and value. If you appreciate the brand name memory, then buy the name brand ram. If you think ram is ram is ram, then save money on ram and buy the generic ram.</p>

<p>Which ever <strong>method</strong> you choose when deciding what is the best memory for your mac, do yourself a favor and upgrade your apple computer to the maximum ram that your machine can allow as that will boost your performance of the computer you spent a lot of money on. Don’t be cheap on ram. Buy as much as you can afford, and your apple computer will accomodate. This one upgrade will offer you the most benefit when it comes to having a reliable computer that runs without any hiccups or service requirements.</p>
