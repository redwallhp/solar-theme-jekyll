<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>I like to shop for memory upgrades being the first thing I tend to look for, but there are times when you need to buy a brand new laptop and with the prices for notebooks continually dropping as more and more features get added over time.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007G7CO2C/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B007G7CO2C">The Acer Aspire is one of many cheap laptops available today</a><br />
**<br />
**Where to Find The Best Laptop Deals</strong></p>

<p>I’ve always like the good folks at <a href="http://www.dealnews.com">dealnews</a> to help me find a deal on PC notebooks especially, and if you’re interested in Apple products, <a href="http://www.macprices.net">Mac Prices</a> does a great job on updating you on the latest Apple deals on Apple Notebooks  and other Apple products too.</p>

<p>eBay is a great place to look for a notebook deal, especially if you can manage the idea of buying a used notebook – folks upgrade their notebooks all the time and when they do they often sell the old notebooks on eBay or Craigslist which is another great  place to look for notebooks.</p>

<p>I find the easiest way to find a great deal on a notebook is to just shop at Amazon, and the last time I was in the market for a notebook,  I just used their best selling notebooks feature to scan the most popular notebook deals of the hour as the list  continually gets updated over time  and if it’s a popular notebook there’s usually a reason and others have bought the exact same notebook and kept it – The deal sites for laptops and the like may offer and calculate great discounts on notebooks, but that doesn’t mean it’s a good notebook. It means it’s a cheap laptop.</p>

<p>Amazon offers the best prices on Laptops continually. Here’s a few of the current best selling cheap notebook computers:</p>

<p>The Acer Aspire AS5750Z-4835 15.6-Inch Laptop offers a really good price and is one of the cheapest laptops you can buy.</p>

<p>The ASUS A53U-EH11 is another cheap laptop on sale today:</p>

<p>And the new Samsung Chromebook is another way to get into a problem free laptop:</p>

<p>These are just 3 of the cheapest and best selling laptops you can buy today. See the best selling laptops for <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/electronics/565108/?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">up to the minute laptop deals</a></strong>.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2012/06/what-is-the-best-affordable-laptop/">What is the Best Affordable Laptop?</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>As newer computer models change over time, so will this list but I thought I’d take time to research some cheaper laptops and what’s currently available on sale. (Of course, you’ll need to add ram to your laptop). You will note I’m not  listing the best selling laptops or even the cheapest laptops because I have found that sometimes spending a bit more money is worth it when laptop shopping.</p>

<div style="float: right; margin-right: 5px;">

<div style="float: right; margin-right: 5px;">
</div>

<p><strong>What is affordable?</strong></p>

<p>If you want a Mac Laptop you’re going to need <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/apple-laptops-price-list/" title="Apple Laptops Price List">close to $1000 to play</a>, and if you don’t have that kind of money then you’re forced to look at a Windows notebook. There was a time that I would loathe to recommend a PC laptop but with Windows 8 on the horizon and a <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/release-preview">consumer preview available</a> I may have to change my tune. You can also install <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a> on the Windows PC and with a bit of tweaking you can get a notebook that feels real close to the Mac OS for a fraction of the price.</p>

<p><strong>Laptops Under $400</strong></p>

<p>I’ve already written about $400 laptops and there’s lots to choose from. Three current  best sellers are:</p>

<p>The Acer Aspire AS5750Z-4835 is one notebook worth a look and offers all the basics of a cheap notebook in a 15.6 inch package with 4GB RAM, 500GB hard drive and a 15.6 inch display.</p>

<p>The Asus A53U-EH11 is another cheap laptop that’s feature packed with and AMD dual core processor, 3GB of RAM and a 320GB hard drive and at under $350.00, this is one of the cheapest notebooks you can buy today.</p>

<p>Don’t discount a chromebook either. The Samsung series 5 chromebook is an option as there’s less hassle with OS stuff and viruses. If you live in a web browser, this could be the perfect notebook for you.</p>

<p><strong>Laptops $500 to $1000</strong></p>

<div>
</div>

<p>If screen real estate is what you need the HP g7-1310us is a hard deal to beat for a 17 inch notebook, especially for the price of just over $500.</p>

<p>If the thought of lugging around a big screen notebook all day brings shivers up your spine, check out the Dell Inspiron i14RN-1227BK. At just under $500 this 14 inch beauty shaves weight off the traditional laptop and is cheaper than an Ultrabook.</p>

<p>And speaking of Ultrabooks, now that they are dropping in price, they are a much cheaper alternative to an Apple offering and are the cheapest and are the best laptops and notebooks you can buy today.</p>

<p>These notebooks are just a taste of what’s available when shopping for a laptop and all I would consider affordable laptops.</p>

<div style="float: right; margin-right: 5px;">
</div>

<p>I don’t know why, but next to some pretty shady memory stores (that I don’t list), the next area where you can get into trouble when shopping online is when you buy a digital camera.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004V4IWKG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004V4IWKG"><strong>The Nikon D5100 is the best selling digital camera</strong></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004V4IWKG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004V4IWKG"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4739" title="Nikon D5100 deal" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Screen-Shot-2012-05-31-at-8.42.17-AM.png" alt="Best Selling Digital Camera" width="310" height="304" /></a></p>

<p>You want to be sure you’re buying a camera that comes in the original box, with all the accessories and packaging too and most important  of all, the warranty card.</p>

<p>You know the saying about how if the price is too good to be true, it is. Well, this applies to camera buying as well and especially with the warranties missing from some camera manufacturers you need to certain that the camera you buy will be supported, especially when you buy a digital SLR camera that tends to be pretty expensive, and why when you shop online for digital slr’s the prices you see from some online vendors can sure be enticing.</p>

<p>But in the long term, they’re not. Some sellers will sell you just the camera body and take out all the accessories, and some online stores try to sell you gray market cameras. These are cameras that were manufactured for one market, but end up being sold in another. An example  would be the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0076AYNXM/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0076AYNXM">Nikon D800 </a>–  a very popular and very expensive digital SLR on sale right now, and a perfect candidate for a grey market SLR.</p>

<p>You want to ensure the Nikon D800 (or any camera you buy) is manufactured for market intended. Differences may be slight or not at all, but if you buy a grey market camera it will not have any warranty. In my case, I want Nikon USA to support my Nikon SLR in the case there’s a problem with the camera.</p>

<p>It’s pretty easy to buy a camera online safely. Buy from trusted vendors you have heard of. If Jim’s Camera  store is offering a too good to be true discount on the camera – guess what? it really is  too good to be true.</p>

<p>I have found that when buying cameras online, <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/electronics/281052/?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">Amazon</a></strong>  continues to offer the best selling cameras at the best  prices and you can be sure you are buying a camera with all the accessories and warranty support you need.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2012/05/where-to-buy-apple-computers-refurbished/">Where To Buy Apple Computers Refurbished</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>These computers are usually returned computers for various reasons that have been inspected by Apple, cleaned and then put back out on sale at a discounted price. If you’re patient and wait for the perfect refurbished Mac to appear you can save money on what essentially may be a brand new Mac.</p>

<p>One way to get a better price or great deal on an Apple computer is to buy a refurbished Apple Computer.</p>

<p><a href="http://store.apple.com">Apple</a> of course is an excellent source for refurbished Macs and also other products too from Apple such as refurbished iPads and iPods too.</p>

<p>Examples of refurbished Macs currently available are:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005CWJ76O/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B005CWJ76O">Apple MacBook Pro 17 inch.</a> Save $200<br />
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005CWIVYI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B005CWIVYI">Apple MacBook Pro 13.3 inch</a> Save $100<br />
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005CWJ1DI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B005CWJ1DI">Apple MacBook 15 inch</a> Save $120.00</p>

<p>**Refurbished iPads<br />
** Another great way to get an iPad deal on an essentially new Apple iPad is to buy refurbishe too, and here’s a few examples of the savings you may expect when compared to the prices of a brand new Apple iPad</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00365F6EG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00365F6EG">Apple iPad (1st Generation 32GB Wifi)</a> Save $70.00<br />
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0047DVWQM/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0047DVWQM"> Apple iPad 2 (32GB Wifi) </a>Save $87.00<br />
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00365F6G4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00365F6G4"> Apple iPad (1st Generation 64GB Wifi)</a> Save $170.00</p>

<p>As you can see from the few examples above, these are pretty good deals on Apple certified and refurbished products and it’s a great way to save money when buying  Apple computers  as they can be expensive when compared to other PC’s using Windows.</p>

<p>Mac Mall is another source you should  check for deals on Apple products as I find that they offer more selection than even the Apple Store and they tend to offer a deal of some sort too –  something that Apple does not, save for the discounted refurbished price.</p>

<p>Buying refurbished Apple Products is one of the better ways to save on Apple products, regardless of whether you’re in the market for an iPad, or Apple Macintosh computer.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2012/05/what-kind-of-ram-do-i-have/">What Kind of RAM Do I Have?</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>Recently, I wrote about memory finders being a perfect way to buy more memory for your Mac or PC  if you’re looking to buy more memory, but what if you just want to find out what kind of RAM you have installed in your desktop or notebook computer already?</p>

<p><strong>Find RAM on Macintosh</strong></p>

<p>On the Mac, it’s easy.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Go to the Apple Menu and select About This Mac</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You’ll see the amount of memory and type of RAM</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you click ‘more info’  there’ s a memory tab that displays the amount of ram installed, how many slots are in use by the ram installed and the type of RAM installed.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Windows 7</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Click <strong>Start</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Right click <strong>computer</strong> and then <strong>properties</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the system section you can see the installed RAM you have.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Ubuntu</strong></p>

<p>Boot into Ubuntu if you  haven’t already done so.</p>

<p>Select <strong>Applications</strong> from the top left corner.</p>

<p>Select  <strong>Accessories</strong> and then <strong>Terminal</strong></p>

<p>Type  the word <strong>top</strong> and the ram installed should be beside <strong>Mem::</strong></p>

<p>If you’re more interested in finding out what brand of RAM you have, then the only way I know how to do this is to physically inspect the RAM as most RAM brands are not displayed in any memory information tool, regardless of operating system.</p>

<p>My Mac Mini shipped with Hynix RAM when I went to replace the 4GB of Mac Mini RAM with 8GB (I went with <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/mn/search/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;field-keywords=CRUCIAL%20MEMORY&amp;url=search-alias%3Daps">Crucial from Amazon</a></strong> as my wife was buying some books at the same time and we get free shipping)  but the Hynix memory upgrades worked just fine for me, as does the Crucial upgrades.</p>

<p>When shopping for ram upgrades I would be more concerned that you have the correct memory speed and  type installed as opposed to buying ram brands. RAM either works or it doesn’t and all ram built or sold by the memory stores I list will do you just fine and come with money back guarantees in the rare event there is a problem.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2012/05/computer-memory-test-how-to-test-installed-ram/">Computer Memory Test: How To Test Installed RAM</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>Most, if not all RAM you buy today is tested by the memory manufacturer or reseller before it gets shipped to you or installed in your computer when you buy it, but even with these failsafe measurements in place, it does happen that  sometimes your computer will start to act up and one cause of the PC’s troubles could be the RAM has gone bad.</p>

<p>There’s also the chance that the operating system you are running doesn’t like to run the memory you have installed. This is rare though and usually happens when an OS update is performed.  It’s been a decade or more since I’ve seen RAM go bad due to and OS change.</p>

<p>But, <strong>RAM does go bad</strong>, as does hard drives (which is  why you should always have a backup too) and there’s many free ram testers out there to help you determine if your RAM has gone bad or not.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.memtest86.com/">MemTest</a>. This memory testing software is completely free to use and the most popular memory testing tools to use today.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/diagnosing-memory-problems-on-your-computer">Windows Memory Diagnostic.</a>. If you’re on a Windows PC, this software comes built in to the operating system so you don’t need to download anything.  Just click start, control panel and search for memory in the search box and click ‘diagnose your computer’s  memory problems’</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>These two programs will help you determine the health of your installed memory upgrades on your Mac or PC. If you do find you have bad RAM, contact the computer memory manufacturer to determine if your installed RAM applies for a warranty replacement as most memory stores today offer a lifetime guarantee  on the ram upgrades they sell.</p>

<p>Memory Upgrade for the average user can be confusing to the average consumer. Sure, there’s propellor heads or those interested in technology and memory upgrades to know the difference between DDR2 and DDR3 SDRAM, but for the customer that does all their computer shopping at Best Buy the ram you need to buy for you notebook or desktop computer can become quite confusing.</p>

<p>That’s why the memory manufacturers and memory stores usually offer some tool online at their website to help you get the right memory upgrade. These tools can be called memory finders, or memory configurators or some other name but they essentially do the same thing and match your computer model with the RAM you need to buy. This is something you won’t find at one of the biggest memory store – Amazon. If you were searching for the best digital cameras you would find a tool to use but not for memory upgrades for your Mac or PC.</p>

<p>Most of the memory finders you will come across work as an online form and you choose your computer manufacturer, computer model, and finally – computer model name where the program redirects you to the proper ram upgrade for you computer. All you then have to do is place your memory upgrade order to complete your memory upgrade sale.</p>

<p>Of course, there’s other ways to find the right memory upgrade for your computer and another (and in my opinion, easier) way to get your ram upgrades is to just offer a search engine – you type in keywords and the search trys to match the memory to what you type. This has both advantages and disadvantages because if you fail to search correctly you may miss out on finding the right memory for your PC.</p>

<p>Lastly, one other way to find the correct memory upgrade is to download software to your PC or Mac that will scan your computer for the right memory for your notebook or desktop computer. Crucial Technology is one memory store that offers this method and also guarantees that your ram will be correct using this tool.</p>

<p>Sometimes a Memory Store may choose to specialize in one PC brand rather than trying to cater to every PC desktop and notebook ever made. Other World Computing comes to mind as an online store that has chosen to build sales and relationships with Apple Macintosh customers over PC users with Windows based machine.</p>

<p>Whatever method you choose, I suggest you use a memory finder to get the best deal on memory upgrades that are guaranteed to work with your computer model.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2012/05/where-to-buy-a-4gb-ram-stick/">Where To Buy a 4GB RAM Stick</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>They’re usually not called ‘ram sticks’ and more commonly known as memory modules or ram upgrades but whatever you call them there’s a very good chance that if you’re looking to upgrade your ram for either your desktop computer or notebook or laptop you need to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/mn/search/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;field-keywords=4gb%20RAM&amp;url=search-alias%3Daps">buy 4GB of RAM </a>. Heck you may even need to buy two 4gb memory modules to max out the memory on your Mac or PC.</p>

<p>I’m showing my age here, but I remember when 1-800-4-Memory first released 1GB ram (for the iBook maybe, I can’t remember) and the price for 1GB of RAM at that time was over $2000. I thought for certain it was a typo because even though ram upgrades were much more expensive back then two thousand dollars for a memory upgrade seemed almost criminal.</p>

<p>Now, you can buy 4GB of RAM for about twenty dollars – a fraction of that price and 4x the memory capacity too.</p>

<p>This goes to show you how <strong>cheap you can buy a 4GB RAM stick this year</strong> as opposed to just a few years ago when 8GB of RAM would cost more than the machine it was going into. It’s different times indeed.</p>

<p>If you’re in the market for 4GB of ram you may want to have a look at 16GB of ram for your Mac or PC too as some computer manufacturers offer the ability to max out your machine at 16GB. On desktop computers, this isn’t that big of a deal as they usually offer 4 or more memory upgrade slots to allow for 4GBx4 ram upgrades, but for notebooks the 16GB usually has to happen by using two 8GB memory modules and you will in most cases have to replace the factory ram too with the bigger 8GB ram upgrades.</p>

<p>For the best prices on 4GB RAM, notebook memory seems to be the most popular and with some notebooks under $400 you want to be sure you get a good deal on RAM too.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2012/05/the-dell-memory-selector-you-can-get-a-better-deal-on-memory-upgrades/">The Dell Memory Selector: You Can Get A Better Deal on Memory Upgrades</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>This should be common knowledge to anybody who’s even remotely familiar with computer memory but in case you’ve missed it – you can do better on ram prices when you buy ram elsewhere.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://accessories.us.dell.com/sna/memconfig.aspx?c=us&amp;l=en&amp;s=bsd&amp;cs=04">Dell Memory Selector </a> is really handy for finding out what memory upgrades you need for dell both new and old and over the years, there have been a lot of dell computers released and it’s always a good ideal to add ram to whatever model you choose but the ram prices from Dell seem to be high when you compare the prices on memory upgrades from other memory manufacturers:</p>

<p>Let’s use an example: The Dell Inspiron 15 is one of the most popular Dell laptops today and to buy <a href="http://accessories.us.dell.com/sna/category.aspx?c=us&amp;l=en&amp;s=bsd&amp;cs=04&amp;category_id=4325&amp;mfgpid=224725&amp;chassisid=-1">memory for the Dell Inspiron 15 from Dell </a>is pretty expensive when you compare the prices to other memory manufacturers and retailers.</p>

<p>Dell charges $38 for 4GB of RAM currently which really is a lot more realistic than the $400 Apple wants for the ram upgrades for their MacBook Pro lineup. Assuming you will need to buy two 4GB DDR3 1333Ghz laptop memory modules to maximize the memory on your Dell, you’re looking at just under $80.00 to max out the dell notebook ram if you buy direct from Dell.</p>

<p>Compare this to <strong><a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT2KIT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1339">memory from Crucial Technology</a></strong> (or others in the pricing table for dell notebook memory below) where you can buy the exact same upgrade for a bit over $40.00 currently. (again, prices may change – see prices below for current dell notebook ram prices ).</p>

<p>That’s a half price discount, or close to – all by doing about 30 seconds of research and looking for alternative sources for Dell Memory Upgrades, other than buying ram from Dell Directly.</p>

<p>Now, if saving money on RAM is not your first and foremost concern, and you want Dell to install RAM in your new Dell notebook than the extra $40 or so you pay for RAM from dell compared to other cheaper sources may be worth it as now you don’t have to install the Dell memory upgrade yourself and can let a certified Dell Technician install the ram into your brand new Dell notebook.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2012/05/web-hosting-shopping-a-look-at-11-web-hosting-plans/">Web Hosting Shopping: A Look at 1&#038;1 Web Hosting Plans</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>There was a time when I didn’t really care about web hosting and happily paid three thousand dollars a year or more for a dedicated web server to host this site (and others), but as the demand for RAM has leveled off and the ram prices have dropped, I am starting to look for ways to save money on my annual web hosting bill.</p>

<p>**I’m with <a href="http://www.pair.com">Pair</a>. **</p>

<p>A few years back, I switched platforms to use wordpress instead of my ever so more complicated html setup. I’ve had a few complaints about tracking the ram prices for the older macs, but my research shows you folks are not looking for ram for older Macs so I now just concentrate on the newer Apple computer models as those are the Macs people are buying and need to upgrade the RAM on. I can speak from personal experience that the only time I have ever bought RAM is when I needed to upgrade the RAM on a brand new Mac – most recently being an Apple Mac Mini I upgraded with 8gb of RAM.</p>

<p>Anyway, back to the web hosting: In an effort to cut costs I transferred this site to shared hosting and except for the odd burp in service, I don’t really have any complaint with them except for the fact that for shared hosting – at $85.00 a month they’re kind of pricey when I compare other web hosting packages available online.</p>

<p>This will, I think be the first in a series of web hosting plan comparisons I hope to do as I can’t help myself – I like to shop and get the best price on stuff, whether it’s web hosting or memory upgrades and 1&amp;1 web hosting is the first host I found alphabetically so I’ll start there:</p>

<p><strong>1&amp;1 Web Hosting Plans</strong></p>

<p>The good folks at 1&amp;1 offer a few plans but the best web hosting from 11 web hosting costs just a little over 3 bucks a month. Even with the 25% discount I got from Pair networks that’s still a significant savings over the $80 a month I am paying now for web hosting. a</p>

<p>I really don’t need a lot for my web hosting needs, as this is just a blog and I bet that any old host would work for my site and traffic load. I would need some mysql databases for the wordpress databases and unlimited traffic and storage space that this cheap web hosting plan from 11 web hosting offers.</p>

<p>I don’t care less about free domain names, email accounts, ssl certificates and or dual hosting. I may be inclined to upgrade the hostin to their business web hosting as opposed to their personal plan, only for the fact that the performance may be better and I think the faster ramseeker is the better.</p>

<p>I can always pay more for web hosting later too, as I have yet to find any business that will not take more money than you are currently paying.</p>
