The Fiio E9 Desktop Headphone Amplifier is designed to give you more ooomph or power for higher end headphones that are more power hungry, but this Headphone Amplifier is a great bargain to get better sound from your computer thanks to the output power of 1watt at 16 Ohms or 800mW at 600 Ohms. This Headphone Amplifier can be used in multiple modifications &#8211; either in your home audio system with passive loudspeakers or in your computer area with either headphones or both active and passive speakers

I bought the Fiio E9 Headphone Amp for one reason, and one reason only: I wanted a big and easy to use volume button without having to adjust the computer&#8217;s volume via keyboard or a mouse. The extra amplification with the highly regarded Burr Brown OPA2134 Op Amps was really just a bonus. Another reason to buy the Fiio E9 is the fact that it plays very nicely with the [Fiio E7 USB DAC ][2] I reviewed recently and results in a powerful headphone amp and DAC [all for under $200 on sale][3].

The Fiio E9 Headphone Amplifier is finished in anodized aluminum and feels like a sturdy audio device with a weight of 445 grams, this has a very good feel for it and doesn&#8217;t feel light and cheesy at all.

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5581" title="JIM_5846" alt="JIM_5846" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/JIM_5846.jpg" width="1024" height="734" />][4]

[click to enlarge photo][4]

The front of the Fiio E9  is where you&#8217;ll find yourself interacting with the unit the most and the design could not be simpler: A big smooth volume button that takes up almost the entire front of the unit accompanied by two headphone jacks &#8211; one for 1/8 (3.5mm) and one for 1/4 (6.35mm) connectors. There&#8217;s also a power indicator light that when first turned on glows red for one second, and then switches to blue. I&#8217;m not sure why they designed this other than to indicate that at first it gets power and then a second later it&#8217;s ready to use? When you turn the power off to about 7pm (as in photo above) the power light obviously goes out too.

I have two complaints about the Fiio E9&#8217;s front. One, after a few months the volume got scratchy when adjusting &#8211; it probably only needs to be cleaned with  a can of air or possibly contact cleaner, but I have only had this a few months and other items I have owned that have knobs and switches do not seem to be affected by dust  like the volume knob on the Fiio E9.

The other issue I have is the indented ports on the headphone jacks sometimes mean the headphone jack can easily pop out or it can be hard to seat the jack. This holds especially true with the 1/8th mini jack. I hope that on future products Fiio decides to omit this and sit the headphone jack inputs flush, the same as they are for the 3.5mm ports on the back of the unit.

&nbsp;

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5586" title="JIM_5844 (1)" alt="JIM_5844 (1)" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/JIM_5844-1.jpg" width="1024" height="803" />][5]

Speaking of the back of the unit, there&#8217;s more than one way and one port on this headphone amp:

**Line In** This port allows you to hook any line output to the Fiio E9. For example, use one of the outputs on your home stereo connected to this port and you can use the headphone Amp with your home audio stereo if it lacks a built in headphone amplifier and output, and even if it does the Fiio E9 will probably sound better anyway. You will need a [rca to 3.5mm adapter cable][6] (not included) to do this. I wish Fiio had also included a RCA left/right input instead of making the input a 1/8inch headphone jack.

**Pre Output **This allows you to connect the fiio headphone amplifer to an amplifier and use this as a pre-amplifier. You could, for example connect your iPod to the line in port, and connect the pre-out port to an amplifier and use the fiio as a preamplifier. The output from this would be a fixed output, and would bypass the volume control on the Fiio E9. You would use the volume control from your amplifier or if applicable &#8211; your source.

**Line Out **This port allows you to output the sound via a 3.5mm port to an amplifier, and unlike the pre-output option, this allows volume adjustment via the volume knob on the front of the headphone amplifier.

**Gain Switch **This is pretty self explanatory. If you have sensitive headphones you won&#8217;t need the extra gain, but if you have high impedance headphones flip the gain switch to the up position.

**USB Input **This allows you to connect your computer to the headphone amplifier, but this only works if you[** buy the Fiio E7**][7] as well and connect it to the dock (see the photo below) . If you don&#8217;t and plan on using it just with a line in, you&#8217;ll still get the benefits of the headphone amplifier but miss out on the functionality the USB IN provides

**Power Input **Pretty self explanatory &#8211; you need to plug it in using the included power adapter (see photo below)

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5579" title="JIM_5843" alt="JIM_5843" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/JIM_5843.jpg" width="1024" height="680" />][8]

[click to enlarge photo][8]

The top of the Fiio E9 offers one connection and it&#8217;s proprietary and only works with other Fiio DAC&#8217;s like the Fiio E7.  I have both the DAC and this amp, and it&#8217;s a match made in heaven as the amplifier charges the fiio E7&#8217;s battery so when you need to use the Fiio E7 as a portable headphone amplifier you&#8217;ll be all charged up and ready to go. When the Fiio E7 is plugged in, the amplification comes from the Fiio E9 and not the Fiio E7. You&#8217;re using the Fiio E7 as a DAC only when docked into the Fiio E9.

## **Fiio E9 Specifications **

The biggest specification is more power for your headphones than you could get out of your iPod, smartphone or notebook computer. This is the perfect companion for more power  hungry headphones. The Fiio E9 ships with loads of power. Using Sennheiser HD 25&#8217;s I am never able than to go louder than 9 o&#8217;clock on the dial for comfortable listening. The texas instruments TPA6120 amplifier offers loads of room and with a total harmonic distortion of 0.00014%, the Fiio E9 offers clean sound.

Two Channel Power output via line out, or 3.5mm and 6.35mm headphone jacks.

On/Off and Mute functions uses sealed relays and and ALPS sealed low noise potentiometer

## Fiio E9 Connection Options

Probably one of the bigger features of the Fiio E9 is the choices on how you can use it. Using the USB IN or Line IN, you have six different connection options: (USB In requires [purchase of Fiio E7][12])

**Line In Connection Choices**

1. Source via 3.5mm out to 3.5mm line in to 3.5mm or 6.35mm headphones

2. Source via 3.5mm out to 3.5mm line in to 3.5mm line out to amplifier to speakers

3. Source via 3.5mm out to 3.5mm line in to 3.5mm line out to active powered speakers

**USB In Connection Choices**

4. Computer USB to USB IN to 3.5mm or 6.35mm headphones

5. Computer USB to USB IN to 35mm line out to amplifier to speakers

6. Computer USB to USB IN to 3.5mm line out to active speakers

## Summary

For the money (usually under $100) this is a good looking headphone amplifier that looks good and sounds even better  &#8211; especially when paired with the Fiio E7 that it was designed for. I find myself listening to music I haven&#8217;t played in years, because the sound is so clear than the sound output I have been used to by using my MacBook Pro&#8217;s headphone amp. I really,really appreciate the old school volume control where a quick tweak of the dial adjusts volume control without me having to stop my workflow to find a sound menu or keyboard button &#8211; this feature alone is worth the price and makes computer audio much more enjoyable.

On good recordings, the sound and power output are nothing less than breathtaking. On lesser recordings this device, like a lot of audio devices that are high quality and don&#8217;t color the sound at all will want you to stop listening, but this is the fault of the original recording and not the Headphone Amplifer. With high quality parts from Texas instruments and with processors and chips usually reserved for high end audiophile equipment costing much more, the Fiio E9 (and matching Fiio E9) could be the best bargain in headphone amplification and listening this year.

  Fiio E7 Portable DAC and Headphone Amplifier

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5533" title="JIM_5414" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/JIM_5414.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" />

The Fiio E7 is a very cheap USB DAC and one of the cheapest USB DACs I have used to date. I bought this to partner with the Fiio E9 (review to come) headphone amplifier as I wanted a knob or dial to adjust the volume on my headphones as opposed to having to control the headphone volume with my computer on my Apple Mac Mini. I find that I&#8217;m listening to headphones more and more and I wanted to get better sound out of my Mac. Little did I know how versatile this USB DAC and headphone amplifier is:

The front side of the DAC/Headphone Amp offers what is either a love it, or hate it mirror finish. I&#8217;m not keen on it due the fact that the mirror finish attracts fingerprints easily, and if you&#8217;re using this more as a portable headphone amp for your ipod or smartphone this could be a consideration.

**Fiio E7 Input Options**[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5543" title="JIM_5450" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/JIM_5450.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="507" />][1]

As the photo above shows there are three different ways to get your music to/through the USB DAC/Headphone Amp.

The first is an AUX input that consists of a 1/8 headphone jack allowing you to plug any source into the DAC as long as it has the standard mini headphone jack size for it&#8217;s output  (or, you can convert it to this. Up next, is a proprietary input jack that can accept accessories such as the Fiio Line out adapter.

There&#8217;s also a line in connector that&#8217;s proprietary for connecting to the Fiio E9 headphone amplifier. This allows you to easily dock the Fiio E7 into the Fiio E9. According to the website this is supposed to make the Fiio E7 sound even better &#8211; probably due to the more power in the Fiio E9

Lastly, the mini USB input for connecting the Fiio E7 to your computer for use as a small headphone amplifier/DAC.

## **Fiio E7 Output Options**

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5542" title="JIM_5448" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/JIM_5448.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="401" />][2]

The flipside of the E7 from Fiio is where you connect your headphones into.  A nice touch is  that there&#8217;s two headphone jacks on the top.  If you plan on using this as a USB DAC I suggest you spend the few dollars and invest in the Fiio Line Out Dock  that plugs into the Fiio&#8217;s connector on the bottom of the DAC and offers a mini USB input and a true Line Out connector instead of using the headphones.  It&#8217;s clear that with the omission of  the line level output as standard equipment that Fiio designed the E7 with the intention of using it as a headphone based unit first and a desktop DAC second. But with a few bucks spent ([under $10 online][3]) you can fix this.

## **Fiio E7 Volume and Controls**

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5541" title="JIM_5447" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/JIM_5447.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="331" />][4]

On the left side of the small DAC and headphone amplifier are four buttons that are pretty self explanatory. Volume Up and Down, Menu Options  and Exit and Power.

## **Fiio E7 Operation and Menu Options**

Menu Button: Click it once to enter the menu, and twice to enter submenu or to confirm your menu choice. Speaking of choices, the Fiio E7 offers a few different options to control this tiny headphone amp and DAC:

**EQ/Bass Boost.** There&#8217;s 3 different levels of bass boost from 1 to 3. I found I like the 1 setting.  A true audiophile would have a straight and no processing, but I find for headphone use especially it&#8217;s nice to add a bit more bass.

**USB Charging **You can choose to turn off the charging when USB is connected.  I don&#8217;t see a reason why you would need to switch this off, but there you go.

**Sleep Function.** To save battery life set the Fiio E7 to sleep from 10 to 90 minutes at ten minute intervals. Or, turn off the sleep function completely.

**Keylock. **Set the Fiio E7 to lock the buttons after a specified time interval  from 20 to 60 seconds.

**Maximum Volume. **This is a very useful to save damage to your ears that could be permanent. You can set the volume from 20 to 60 (the maximum volume) I found [using my headphones ][5] I rarely went past 20 so there&#8217;s lots of extra power to spare assuming you&#8217;re using relatively sensitive headphones.

**Volume Memory **You can choose to remember what volume you last had when you turned off the Fiio E7 or you can choose not to.

## **Fiio E7 Features and Specifications**

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5544" title="JIM_5479" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/JIM_5479.jpg" alt="" width="608" height="640" />][6]The Fiio E7 is one of the best selling headphone amplifiers  due to the fact that for the price, this is best value for a feature packed yet portable DAC that&#8217;s just as comfortable with home use as it is portable.

**USB Audio Decoding** The problem with the digital audio converter in your iPod or notebook is that the part is not the same high quality as the parts inside the Fiio E7.  But with the portable headphone DAC, you can set your computer&#8217; operating system to output the sound via USB which the Fiio can then decode.

**Name Brand Chips for Decoding **The Fiio E7 ships with the Texas Instruments 2706 chip for a USB receiver and for the digital to analog conversion it&#8217;  powered by Wolfson DAC chips &#8211; the WM 8740

**Built In Headphone Amplifier and Pre Amp**The Fiio E7 pre-amp section is powered with a Texas Instrument TPA6130A for processing and an AD8692 chip for headphone amplifier section.

**Standard 3.5mm Line In Jack **I had already mentioned this earlier as this is a great way not only to hook up your iPod or iPad to the Fiio, but also any item that can outuput sound via a very standard and popular 3.5mm headphone port.

**Dual Headphone Outputs **A great way to share your music with others.

**Digital Volume Control** offers fast and precise volume adjustment

**Built In Equalizer** with 3 different levels of bass boost

**Built In Battery **offers up to 80 hours of use,  and full charge from USB port in less than six hours.

** Specialized Docking Port **for connecting the Fiio E7 to  the Fiio E9 for even greater versatility and performance.

**Aluminum Case and Small Size **96mm x 55mm x 15.5 mm and weight of just 100g allow it to easily be portable with lightweight and strength of the aluminum case.

**USB Charging Option **This allows you to turn off the USB charging for even greater performance by allowing you to turn  off the charging circuitry completely via a menu option. This prolongs the battery lifespan and allows you to achieve even cleaner sound.

**Volume Memory and Maximum Volume **Protect your ears and pick up where you left off when you turn the Fiio E7 back on.

**Automatic Keylock  **Assures you won&#8217;t bump the buttons when it&#8217;s in your pocket

**Sleep Timer **Saves you on battery life.

## **Fiio E7 Technical Specifications **

**No Drivers Needed.**  Will play fine with all Windows Software and Mac OS  too.

**Output Power **150mW at 16 Ohms and 16mW at 300 Ohm

**Headphone Impedence Range** 16 Ohm to 300 Ohm

**Signal To Noise Ratio **95db on Line In, 100db on USB In

**Total Harmonic Distortion** .0009% on Line In and  .0008% on USB In.

**Frequency Range** 10Hz to 100KHz

**Recharging** USB 5V DC 400mA

Rubber Band. This allows you to wrap this around your iPod or Smartphone and have both the Fiio E7 and your source in one easy group.

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5536" title="JIM_5438" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/JIM_5438.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="506" />][10]

Soft Velvet (faux, I bet) case to protect your Fiio E7 from scuffs and scratches.

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5539" title="JIM_5443" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/JIM_5443.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" />][11]

Rubber Bumper Case protects the Fiio E7 from bumps when used as a portable  DAC/Headphone Amp[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5535" title="JIM_5437" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/JIM_5437.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="302" />][12]

3.5mm to 3.5mm cable. Connect on end to your iPod headphone jack and the other end to the AUX input on the Fiio E7. (You&#8217;re better off buying the [Fiio L9 L-Shaped iPod Cable][13] for your iPod. This allows a better output on your iPod and bypasses the iPod&#8217;s DAC)

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5534" title="JIM_5429" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/JIM_5429.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="444" />][14]

## **Using the Fiio E7**

Now that we&#8217;ve looked at the specs and stats of the Fiio E7, **how does it sound?**

I found the sound to be accurate in both use as a headphone DAC (I used the Fiio E9 for the amplifier section, bypassing the Fiio&#8217;s amplification) and as a DAC for my home music server via the USB input and both sound great.

The sound is very accurate so if you have an inferior recording, it will show.  This DAC does not hide or color the sound I have found. For the money I spent on the Fiio E7, this might be the best USB DAC I have used and reviewed to date. With a street price well under the $99.99 MSRP this is a cheap USB DAC and headphone amp that offers great value for those wanting more power and better sound for both their Apple iPods, or home music server systems.

The one thing I could do without is the mirrored finish as it collects fingerprints very easily, Not photographed is the included cleaning cloth to help with this though. Fiio E7 comes with an amazing amount of free accessories too allowing multiple uses and configurations when out and about or use at home with 2 different cases.  It&#8217;s light, has oodles of power (I never made it past 1/3) has decent specifications when it comes to distortion and well, just sounds great.

## **Where To Buy the Fiio E7**

<div style="float: right; margin-right: 5px;">
</div>

**[I bought mine at Amazon][15]** and I ask that if ****[you&#8217;re considering buying the Fiio E7 online that you do too][15]****. I get a very small commission and your Amazon purchases allow me to buy more stuff to review. Nobody is giving me free products &#8211; I bought the Fiio E7 for review with my own money. This is the same item you will get at purchase and not a review sample or prototype. Thank You.

1TB SSD Prices are still in the stratosphere for the time being, but over time we will see the prices for 1 TB ssd drives drop, just like we have seen the prices for 1TB hard drives drop over the years. But I suggest while you wait for the prices for 1TB SSD&#8217;s to come down to earth, **[check out hard drives that are known as hybrid drives][1]**

Consider the cost of a brand new SSD drive will set you back close to $2500 (if not more, as you can see from some of the best prices I found for 1TB SSD prices currently for a solid state drive with that much capacity. But what if you could get real close to the performance of an SSD for a fraction of that? You&#8217;d be all over it, right? I know I was an that&#8217;s why I upgraded my MacBook Pro with a hybrid SSD drive as opposed to buying a SSD. I think I paid a little over $100 for my Seagate Hybrid drive and it works great because after a while it remembers your most accessed data for faster hard drive performance when compared to standard hard drives, but at a fraction of the SSD costs.

If you&#8217;re buying a 64GB SSD or even a 128GB SSD you may not care about the hybrid drives as the realSSD prices may be cheaper than a hybrid drive anyway, but for the 1TB size for Solid State Drives, I think you&#8217;d be better to spend your money elsewhere. At the prices the Solid State hard drives are demanding for 1TB you could buy a few, if not many computers for the same price.

		<div class="post-content">The cheapest Apple MacBook Pro you can buy today is priced with a $1799.00 MSRP but **[you can save $100 or more when you buy this Apple notebook from Amazon][1]** and not have to pay sales tax on your brand new 15 inch MacBook Pro too.

[<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4820" title="15 inch MacBook Pro Prices" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Screen-Shot-2012-06-07-at-7.13.04-AM.png" alt="Best Prices for Apple MacBook Pro" width="307" height="295" />][1]One of the best notebooks ever to come out of Apple computer is the Apple 15 inch MacBook Pro.

This is not the cheapest Apple MacBook you can buy today, but I find that unless you need the faster processor speed of the more advanced MacBook Pro this would do the trick for me quite nicely. The cheaper 15 inch MacBook Pro is one of the better deals when it comes to specifications too.

Available with either a 500gb or 750gb hard drive, and a 2.2 Quad Core Intel i7 processor with 4GB of RAM and a 15.4 inch LED display that&#8217;s the main attraction for this particular MacBook Pro model. With lesser MacBook Pro models you can buy them cheaper sure, but you pay with a smaller screen size. But for the road warrior, this might not be the best notebook because the 5.6lbs of weight can add up over a long business day. The advantage of this MacBook Pro model is the affordable price and the bigger screen size.

But there&#8217;s another 15 inch MacBook Pro that is a little more money but you do get a faster processor with a 2.4GHz processor and a bigger hard drive &#8211; the cheaper MacBook Pro ships with a 500GB as standard equipment, but this model ships with bigger 750GB model for those that need more storage space than the less expensive MacBook Pro offers and as you can see above this **[15 inch MacBook Pro is on sale for a $200 discount][2]**, making this the better deal when you compare the 2.2 Ghz MacBook Pro vs the MacBook Pro 2.4 Ghz models.

With the prices for solid state drives continuing to drop over time, this just might be the year where 128GB SSD drives become affordable for folks like you and I. In the past, due to the newness of the SSD technology, you would pay a very high price for an 128gb solid state drive, or SSD drive of any kind but now they are slowly becoming the default choice when it comes to buying a hard drive, either as a replacement hard drive or installed at the factory in a brand new notebook.

[<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4799" title="Best Price 128GB SSD" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Screen-Shot-2012-06-06-at-6.43.43-AM.png" alt="128GB SSD Prices" width="318" height="255" />][1]

**128GB SSD Brands  
**

**Crucial Technology SSD Drives** is one of the more popular brands when it comes to buying a solid state hard drive on sale and with prices for 128GB ssd&#8217;s hovering real close to $100 now they&#8217;re cheap enough too.

**OCZ Vertex **is another very popular SSD Drive choice, and now with the latest update to version 4 you can achieve speeds of up to 120K IOPS &#8211; one of the fastest solid state hard drives you can buy today.

Samsung 830 Series Solid State Drives are another choice when buying a SSD hard drive in the 128GB format and with a household name like Samsung this might be considered the best solid state brand.

There are many different brands for SSD drives, especially in the 128GB size as this is the solid state hard drive size that&#8217;s the most affordable, yet still offers enough storage space for your everyday computing needs, the solid state hard drives listed above are just a taste of the current **[solid state drives on sale][2]**

   <B> <h1><a href="/2012/06/hrt-music-streamer-ii-usb-dac-digital-audio-converter-review/">HRT Music Streamer II USB DAC (Digital Audio Converter) Review</a></h1></B>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content">I had originally sent an email to High Resolution Technologies for a review sample of this model, and although the president of HRT got back to me, I was to hear from the US distributor of this audio component and I never did hear back and I really wanted to review this product  so I just bought the DAC myself.  I find it mightt just be easier to do it this way than to worry about return dates and shipping costs, especially for inexpensive products like the **[HRT Music Streamer II][1]**

[<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4778" title="HRT1" alt="" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/HRT1.png" width="630" height="341" />][2]

**Size and Weight**

****One of the very first thing I noticed was the size and weight of the HRT Music Streamer II, and it was much smaller in size than I had anticipated by the online photos I had seen. The actual dimensions of the DAC from High resolution technologies are not much bigger than the photo above, at just  a tad over 5 inches long and 2 inches wide and one inch tall , this is one of the smaller audio components I own.

**Connections**

The output side of the HRT Music Streamer II  is all about the business of connecting the DAC to your  Amplifier or Home Audio reciever, or any other device that offers line in inputs.  Connect some analog interconnects to this and your stereo and you are off to the races.

[<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4780" title="HRT music streamer II analog out. " alt="" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/HRT2.png" width="630" height="422" />][3]  
The business end of the HRT Music Streamer II is where the rubber hits the road and allows you to connect the DAC to your computer.  This allows you to do one very important thing and that is to bypass the sound card of  your PC (in my case, a cheap acer netbook) and use the HRT Music Streamer II  to process the digital sound coming out of your computer. The dedicated DAC will sound much better than the sound card installed in your PC as an afterthought.

[<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4781" title="HRT3" alt="" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/HRT3.png" width="630" height="330" />][4]

The Asynchronous USB connection is what you really need to pay attention to, as it&#8217;s my understanding that this feature allows for the DAC to dictate the speed and control of the data as it processes it in real time. This results in less errors or audio &#8216;jitter&#8217; I am led to understand because with this feature the DAC has control of the speed and not the PC.

Also on this end are the different digital sampling rates up to 96k, yet for my use I just want better sound from my CD collection I ripped to ALAC format and just want to have bitperfect output at 16/44.1 so I did not try all the other sampling rates for this review, but the DAC instantly locked on to the redbook CD output signal and had the display change to light up the 44k1 LED. It just worked, right out of the box without having to worry about PC drivers or other issues

**How does the HRT Music Streamer Sound? **

I am just an audio enthusiast looking to get the best sound affordably from my system, I want my speakers to be the most expensive component and this is why I was attracted to the HRT Music Streamer II. I am not looking to be the expert audiophile by any stretch. We just like to listen to music and the sound from the notebook from the PC was far from perfect. With the HRT Music Streamer II the first indicator of how good this product is is that my wife noticed and appreciated the difference in sound with the DAC installed.

I found that for the price this is a welcome addition to our home stereo. Due to system placement issues the system is tucked into a corner and the speakers are too close together for my liking and listening position.  Without the DAC, the system lacked imaging but with the HRT Music Streamer II integrated I found much more stereo imaging and placement of the musical instruments than before.

The bottom line is we are pleased with our purchase as it improved the sound of our home stereo system greatly and affordably, allowing us to replace the CD player with a cheap digital music server and DAC solution. The entire cost for both PC and DAC was well under $400. You don&#8217;t need to buy an expensive music server to get great sound. A Mac Mini or cheap notebook will serve very nicely as an excellent music server and storage device.

**Features and Benefits of the HRT Music Streamer II  
**  
**USB Powered**. This means that you don&#8217;t need any ugly wall warts or power adapters to use this DAC and this is important if you&#8217;re planning to use the music streamer in a living area where you don&#8217;t want unsightly cables. This also is pretty energy efficient because all your power needs are served by your PC.

**Size and Weight** &#8211; This unit is small and will not take up any rack or shelving space. You could easily hide the HRT music streamer behind an amplifier or even place the DAC on top

**Ease of Use.** This truly is a plug and play device.

**Asynchronous USB**. The DAC dictates the transfer rate for better sound.

**24/96 Sample Rate and Bit Depth.** High Resolution Audio never sounded so good

**Mac and PC compatible.** Use iTunes or Windows Media Player for playback of your audio.

**Summary: ** For a little over $100 this is an affordable DAC that sounds really great for the price. Considering you can spend this much on cables to connect the DAC to your amplifier, the fact that you get an actual audio component for the same price might be the best audio bargain of this year. I do wish the DAC were more in the design of standard audio component either full sized or half sized but the small size does make this easy to tuck behind a more standard stereo component.

[<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4794" title="hrt4" alt="" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/hrt4.png" width="630" height="331" />][5]

**Where to Buy the HRT Music Streamer II.** I **[bought mine at Amazon][1]** and I ask you to consider the same if you enjoyed this digital review. Prices tend to be the lowest not just for the HRT Music Streamer II but every other audio component too such as [USB cables][6] or [audio interconnects][7] you will need to buy as well to get the best sound out of the HRT Music Streamer II and this will sound much better for say, MacBook Pro Audio via the USB port than if you were to   use the regular headphone output  on the Apple notebook.

		<div class="post-content">I like to shop for memory upgrades being the first thing I tend to look for, but there are times when you need to buy a brand new laptop and with the prices for notebooks continually dropping as more and more features get added over time.

**[The Acer Aspire is one of many cheap laptops available today][1]  
**  
**Where to Find The Best Laptop Deals**

I&#8217;ve always like the good folks at [dealnews][2] to help me find a deal on PC notebooks especially, and if you&#8217;re interested in Apple products, [Mac Prices][3] does a great job on updating you on the latest Apple deals on Apple Notebooks  and other Apple products too.

eBay is a great place to look for a notebook deal, especially if you can manage the idea of buying a used notebook &#8211; folks upgrade their notebooks all the time and when they do they often sell the old notebooks on eBay or Craigslist which is another great  place to look for notebooks.

I find the easiest way to find a great deal on a notebook is to just shop at Amazon, and the last time I was in the market for a notebook,  I just used their best selling notebooks feature to scan the most popular notebook deals of the hour as the list  continually gets updated over time  and if it&#8217;s a popular notebook there&#8217;s usually a reason and others have bought the exact same notebook and kept it &#8211; The deal sites for laptops and the like may offer and calculate great discounts on notebooks, but that doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s a good notebook. It means it&#8217;s a cheap laptop.

Amazon offers the best prices on Laptops continually. Here&#8217;s a few of the current best selling cheap notebook computers:

The Acer Aspire AS5750Z-4835 15.6-Inch Laptop offers a really good price and is one of the cheapest laptops you can buy.

The ASUS A53U-EH11 is another cheap laptop on sale today:

And the new Samsung Chromebook is another way to get into a problem free laptop:

These are just 3 of the cheapest and best selling laptops you can buy today. See the best selling laptops for **[up to the minute laptop deals][4]**.

		<div class="post-content">As newer computer models change over time, so will this list but I thought I&#8217;d take time to research some cheaper laptops and what&#8217;s currently available on sale. (Of course, you&#8217;ll need to add ram to your laptop). You will note I&#8217;m not  listing the best selling laptops or even the cheapest laptops because I have found that sometimes spending a bit more money is worth it when laptop shopping.

**What is affordable?**

If you want a Mac Laptop you&#8217;re going to need [close to $1000 to play][1], and if you don&#8217;t have that kind of money then you&#8217;re forced to look at a Windows notebook. There was a time that I would loathe to recommend a PC laptop but with Windows 8 on the horizon and a [consumer preview available][2] I may have to change my tune. You can also install [Ubuntu][3] on the Windows PC and with a bit of tweaking you can get a notebook that feels real close to the Mac OS for a fraction of the price.

**Laptops Under $400**

I&#8217;ve already written about $400 laptops and there&#8217;s lots to choose from. Three current  best sellers are:



The Acer Aspire AS5750Z-4835 is one notebook worth a look and offers all the basics of a cheap notebook in a 15.6 inch package with 4GB RAM, 500GB hard drive and a 15.6 inch display.



The Asus A53U-EH11 is another cheap laptop that&#8217;s feature packed with and AMD dual core processor, 3GB of RAM and a 320GB hard drive and at under $350.00, this is one of the cheapest notebooks you can buy today.



Don&#8217;t discount a chromebook either. The Samsung series 5 chromebook is an option as there&#8217;s less hassle with OS stuff and viruses. If you live in a web browser, this could be the perfect notebook for you.

**Laptops $500 to $1000**

<div>
</div>

If screen real estate is what you need the HP g7-1310us is a hard deal to beat for a 17 inch notebook, especially for the price of just over $500.



If the thought of lugging around a big screen notebook all day brings shivers up your spine, check out the Dell Inspiron i14RN-1227BK. At just under $500 this 14 inch beauty shaves weight off the traditional laptop and is cheaper than an Ultrabook.



And speaking of Ultrabooks, now that they are dropping in price, they are a much cheaper alternative to an Apple offering and are the cheapest and are the best laptops and notebooks you can buy today.



These notebooks are just a taste of what&#8217;s available when shopping for a laptop and all I would consider affordable laptops.

I don&#8217;t know why, but next to some pretty shady memory stores (that I don&#8217;t list), the next area where you can get into trouble when shopping online is when you buy a digital camera.

[**The Nikon D5100 is the best selling digital camera**][1]

[<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4739" title="Nikon D5100 deal" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Screen-Shot-2012-05-31-at-8.42.17-AM.png" alt="Best Selling Digital Camera" width="310" height="304" />][1]

You want to be sure you&#8217;re buying a camera that comes in the original box, with all the accessories and packaging too and most important  of all, the warranty card.

You know the saying about how if the price is too good to be true, it is. Well, this applies to camera buying as well and especially with the warranties missing from some camera manufacturers you need to certain that the camera you buy will be supported, especially when you buy a digital SLR camera that tends to be pretty expensive, and why when you shop online for digital slr&#8217;s the prices you see from some online vendors can sure be enticing.

But in the long term, they&#8217;re not. Some sellers will sell you just the camera body and take out all the accessories, and some online stores try to sell you gray market cameras. These are cameras that were manufactured for one market, but end up being sold in another. An example  would be the [Nikon D800 ][2]&#8211;  a very popular and very expensive digital SLR on sale right now, and a perfect candidate for a grey market SLR.

You want to ensure the Nikon D800 (or any camera you buy) is manufactured for market intended. Differences may be slight or not at all, but if you buy a grey market camera it will not have any warranty. In my case, I want Nikon USA to support my Nikon SLR in the case there&#8217;s a problem with the camera.

It&#8217;s pretty easy to buy a camera online safely. Buy from trusted vendors you have heard of. If Jim&#8217;s Camera  store is offering a too good to be true discount on the camera &#8211; guess what? it really is  too good to be true.

I have found that when buying cameras online, **[Amazon][3]**  continues to offer the best selling cameras at the best  prices and you can be sure you are buying a camera with all the accessories and warranty support you need.

<br>

		<div class="post-content">These computers are usually returned computers for various reasons that have been inspected by Apple, cleaned and then put back out on sale at a discounted price. If you&#8217;re patient and wait for the perfect refurbished Mac to appear you can save money on what essentially may be a brand new Mac.

One way to get a better price or great deal on an Apple computer is to buy a refurbished Apple Computer.

[Apple][1] of course is an excellent source for refurbished Macs and also other products too from Apple such as refurbished iPads and iPods too.

Examples of refurbished Macs currently available are:

[Apple MacBook Pro 17 inch.][2] Save $200  
[Apple MacBook Pro 13.3 inch][3] Save $100  
[Apple MacBook 15 inch][4] Save $120.00

**Refurbished iPads  
** Another great way to get an iPad deal on an essentially new Apple iPad is to buy refurbishe too, and here&#8217;s a few examples of the savings you may expect when compared to the prices of a brand new Apple iPad

[Apple iPad (1st Generation 32GB Wifi)][5] Save $70.00  
[ Apple iPad 2 (32GB Wifi) ][6]Save $87.00  
[ Apple iPad (1st Generation 64GB Wifi)][7] Save $170.00

As you can see from the few examples above, these are pretty good deals on Apple certified and refurbished products and it&#8217;s a great way to save money when buying  Apple computers  as they can be expensive when compared to other PC&#8217;s using Windows.

Mac Mall is another source you should  check for deals on Apple products as I find that they offer more selection than even the Apple Store and they tend to offer a deal of some sort too &#8211;  something that Apple does not, save for the discounted refurbished price.

Buying refurbished Apple Products is one of the better ways to save on Apple products, regardless of whether you&#8217;re in the market for an iPad, or Apple Macintosh computer.
