1TB SSD Prices are still in the stratosphere for the time being, but over time we will see the prices for 1 TB ssd drives drop, just like we have seen the prices for 1TB hard drives drop over the years. But I suggest while you wait for the prices for 1TB SSD&#8217;s to come down to earth, **[check out hard drives that are known as hybrid drives][1]**

Consider the cost of a brand new SSD drive will set you back close to $2500 (if not more, as you can see from some of the best prices I found for 1TB SSD prices currently for a solid state drive with that much capacity. But what if you could get real close to the performance of an SSD for a fraction of that? You&#8217;d be all over it, right? I know I was an that&#8217;s why I upgraded my MacBook Pro with a hybrid SSD drive as opposed to buying a SSD. I think I paid a little over $100 for my Seagate Hybrid drive and it works great because after a while it remembers your most accessed data for faster hard drive performance when compared to standard hard drives, but at a fraction of the SSD costs.

If you&#8217;re buying a 64GB SSD or even a 128GB SSD you may not care about the hybrid drives as the realSSD prices may be cheaper than a hybrid drive anyway, but for the 1TB size for Solid State Drives, I think you&#8217;d be better to spend your money elsewhere. At the prices the Solid State hard drives are demanding for 1TB you could buy a few, if not many computers for the same price.

<br>

		<div class="post-content">The cheapest Apple MacBook Pro you can buy today is priced with a $1799.00 MSRP but **[you can save $100 or more when you buy this Apple notebook from Amazon][1]** and not have to pay sales tax on your brand new 15 inch MacBook Pro too.

[<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4820" title="15 inch MacBook Pro Prices" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Screen-Shot-2012-06-07-at-7.13.04-AM.png" alt="Best Prices for Apple MacBook Pro" width="307" height="295" />][1]One of the best notebooks ever to come out of Apple computer is the Apple 15 inch MacBook Pro.

This is not the cheapest Apple MacBook you can buy today, but I find that unless you need the faster processor speed of the more advanced MacBook Pro this would do the trick for me quite nicely. The cheaper 15 inch MacBook Pro is one of the better deals when it comes to specifications too.

Available with either a 500gb or 750gb hard drive, and a 2.2 Quad Core Intel i7 processor with 4GB of RAM and a 15.4 inch LED display that&#8217;s the main attraction for this particular MacBook Pro model. With lesser MacBook Pro models you can buy them cheaper sure, but you pay with a smaller screen size. But for the road warrior, this might not be the best notebook because the 5.6lbs of weight can add up over a long business day. The advantage of this MacBook Pro model is the affordable price and the bigger screen size.

But there&#8217;s another 15 inch MacBook Pro that is a little more money but you do get a faster processor with a 2.4GHz processor and a bigger hard drive &#8211; the cheaper MacBook Pro ships with a 500GB as standard equipment, but this model ships with bigger 750GB model for those that need more storage space than the less expensive MacBook Pro offers and as you can see above this **[15 inch MacBook Pro is on sale for a $200 discount][2]**, making this the better deal when you compare the 2.2 Ghz MacBook Pro vs the MacBook Pro 2.4 Ghz models.

With the prices for solid state drives continuing to drop over time, this just might be the year where 128GB SSD drives become affordable for folks like you and I. In the past, due to the newness of the SSD technology, you would pay a very high price for an 128gb solid state drive, or SSD drive of any kind but now they are slowly becoming the default choice when it comes to buying a hard drive, either as a replacement hard drive or installed at the factory in a brand new notebook.

[<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4799" title="Best Price 128GB SSD" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Screen-Shot-2012-06-06-at-6.43.43-AM.png" alt="128GB SSD Prices" width="318" height="255" />][1]

**128GB SSD Brands  
**

**Crucial Technology SSD Drives** is one of the more popular brands when it comes to buying a solid state hard drive on sale and with prices for 128GB ssd&#8217;s hovering real close to $100 now they&#8217;re cheap enough too.

**OCZ Vertex **is another very popular SSD Drive choice, and now with the latest update to version 4 you can achieve speeds of up to 120K IOPS &#8211; one of the fastest solid state hard drives you can buy today.

Samsung 830 Series Solid State Drives are another choice when buying a SSD hard drive in the 128GB format and with a household name like Samsung this might be considered the best solid state brand.

There are many different brands for SSD drives, especially in the 128GB size as this is the solid state hard drive size that&#8217;s the most affordable, yet still offers enough storage space for your everyday computing needs, the solid state hard drives listed above are just a taste of the current **[solid state drives on sale][2]**

   <B> <h1><a href="/2012/06/hrt-music-streamer-ii-usb-dac-digital-audio-converter-review/">HRT Music Streamer II USB DAC (Digital Audio Converter) Review</a></h1></B>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content">I had originally sent an email to High Resolution Technologies for a review sample of this model, and although the president of HRT got back to me, I was to hear from the US distributor of this audio component and I never did hear back and I really wanted to review this product  so I just bought the DAC myself.  I find it mightt just be easier to do it this way than to worry about return dates and shipping costs, especially for inexpensive products like the **[HRT Music Streamer II][1]**

[<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4778" title="HRT1" alt="" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/HRT1.png" width="630" height="341" />][2]

**Size and Weight**

****One of the very first thing I noticed was the size and weight of the HRT Music Streamer II, and it was much smaller in size than I had anticipated by the online photos I had seen. The actual dimensions of the DAC from High resolution technologies are not much bigger than the photo above, at just  a tad over 5 inches long and 2 inches wide and one inch tall , this is one of the smaller audio components I own.

**Connections**

The output side of the HRT Music Streamer II  is all about the business of connecting the DAC to your  Amplifier or Home Audio reciever, or any other device that offers line in inputs.  Connect some analog interconnects to this and your stereo and you are off to the races.

[<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4780" title="HRT music streamer II analog out. " alt="" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/HRT2.png" width="630" height="422" />][3]  
The business end of the HRT Music Streamer II is where the rubber hits the road and allows you to connect the DAC to your computer.  This allows you to do one very important thing and that is to bypass the sound card of  your PC (in my case, a cheap acer netbook) and use the HRT Music Streamer II  to process the digital sound coming out of your computer. The dedicated DAC will sound much better than the sound card installed in your PC as an afterthought.

[<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4781" title="HRT3" alt="" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/HRT3.png" width="630" height="330" />][4]

The Asynchronous USB connection is what you really need to pay attention to, as it&#8217;s my understanding that this feature allows for the DAC to dictate the speed and control of the data as it processes it in real time. This results in less errors or audio &#8216;jitter&#8217; I am led to understand because with this feature the DAC has control of the speed and not the PC.

Also on this end are the different digital sampling rates up to 96k, yet for my use I just want better sound from my CD collection I ripped to ALAC format and just want to have bitperfect output at 16/44.1 so I did not try all the other sampling rates for this review, but the DAC instantly locked on to the redbook CD output signal and had the display change to light up the 44k1 LED. It just worked, right out of the box without having to worry about PC drivers or other issues

**How does the HRT Music Streamer Sound? **

I am just an audio enthusiast looking to get the best sound affordably from my system, I want my speakers to be the most expensive component and this is why I was attracted to the HRT Music Streamer II. I am not looking to be the expert audiophile by any stretch. We just like to listen to music and the sound from the notebook from the PC was far from perfect. With the HRT Music Streamer II the first indicator of how good this product is is that my wife noticed and appreciated the difference in sound with the DAC installed.

I found that for the price this is a welcome addition to our home stereo. Due to system placement issues the system is tucked into a corner and the speakers are too close together for my liking and listening position.  Without the DAC, the system lacked imaging but with the HRT Music Streamer II integrated I found much more stereo imaging and placement of the musical instruments than before.

The bottom line is we are pleased with our purchase as it improved the sound of our home stereo system greatly and affordably, allowing us to replace the CD player with a cheap digital music server and DAC solution. The entire cost for both PC and DAC was well under $400. You don&#8217;t need to buy an expensive music server to get great sound. A Mac Mini or cheap notebook will serve very nicely as an excellent music server and storage device.

**Features and Benefits of the HRT Music Streamer II  
**  
**USB Powered**. This means that you don&#8217;t need any ugly wall warts or power adapters to use this DAC and this is important if you&#8217;re planning to use the music streamer in a living area where you don&#8217;t want unsightly cables. This also is pretty energy efficient because all your power needs are served by your PC.

**Size and Weight** &#8211; This unit is small and will not take up any rack or shelving space. You could easily hide the HRT music streamer behind an amplifier or even place the DAC on top

**Ease of Use.** This truly is a plug and play device.

**Asynchronous USB**. The DAC dictates the transfer rate for better sound.

**24/96 Sample Rate and Bit Depth.** High Resolution Audio never sounded so good

**Mac and PC compatible.** Use iTunes or Windows Media Player for playback of your audio.

**Summary: ** For a little over $100 this is an affordable DAC that sounds really great for the price. Considering you can spend this much on cables to connect the DAC to your amplifier, the fact that you get an actual audio component for the same price might be the best audio bargain of this year. I do wish the DAC were more in the design of standard audio component either full sized or half sized but the small size does make this easy to tuck behind a more standard stereo component.

[<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4794" title="hrt4" alt="" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/hrt4.png" width="630" height="331" />][5]

**Where to Buy the HRT Music Streamer II.** I **[bought mine at Amazon][1]** and I ask you to consider the same if you enjoyed this digital review. Prices tend to be the lowest not just for the HRT Music Streamer II but every other audio component too such as [USB cables][6] or [audio interconnects][7] you will need to buy as well to get the best sound out of the HRT Music Streamer II and this will sound much better for say, MacBook Pro Audio via the USB port than if you were to   use the regular headphone output  on the Apple notebook.

<br>

		<div class="post-content">I like to shop for memory upgrades being the first thing I tend to look for, but there are times when you need to buy a brand new laptop and with the prices for notebooks continually dropping as more and more features get added over time.

**[The Acer Aspire is one of many cheap laptops available today][1]  
**  
**Where to Find The Best Laptop Deals**

I&#8217;ve always like the good folks at [dealnews][2] to help me find a deal on PC notebooks especially, and if you&#8217;re interested in Apple products, [Mac Prices][3] does a great job on updating you on the latest Apple deals on Apple Notebooks  and other Apple products too.

eBay is a great place to look for a notebook deal, especially if you can manage the idea of buying a used notebook &#8211; folks upgrade their notebooks all the time and when they do they often sell the old notebooks on eBay or Craigslist which is another great  place to look for notebooks.

I find the easiest way to find a great deal on a notebook is to just shop at Amazon, and the last time I was in the market for a notebook,  I just used their best selling notebooks feature to scan the most popular notebook deals of the hour as the list  continually gets updated over time  and if it&#8217;s a popular notebook there&#8217;s usually a reason and others have bought the exact same notebook and kept it &#8211; The deal sites for laptops and the like may offer and calculate great discounts on notebooks, but that doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s a good notebook. It means it&#8217;s a cheap laptop.

Amazon offers the best prices on Laptops continually. Here&#8217;s a few of the current best selling cheap notebook computers:

The Acer Aspire AS5750Z-4835 15.6-Inch Laptop offers a really good price and is one of the cheapest laptops you can buy.

The ASUS A53U-EH11 is another cheap laptop on sale today:

And the new Samsung Chromebook is another way to get into a problem free laptop:

These are just 3 of the cheapest and best selling laptops you can buy today. See the best selling laptops for **[up to the minute laptop deals][4]**.

		<div class="post-content">As newer computer models change over time, so will this list but I thought I&#8217;d take time to research some cheaper laptops and what&#8217;s currently available on sale. (Of course, you&#8217;ll need to add ram to your laptop). You will note I&#8217;m not  listing the best selling laptops or even the cheapest laptops because I have found that sometimes spending a bit more money is worth it when laptop shopping.

**What is affordable?**

If you want a Mac Laptop you&#8217;re going to need [close to $1000 to play][1], and if you don&#8217;t have that kind of money then you&#8217;re forced to look at a Windows notebook. There was a time that I would loathe to recommend a PC laptop but with Windows 8 on the horizon and a [consumer preview available][2] I may have to change my tune. You can also install [Ubuntu][3] on the Windows PC and with a bit of tweaking you can get a notebook that feels real close to the Mac OS for a fraction of the price.

**Laptops Under $400**

I&#8217;ve already written about $400 laptops and there&#8217;s lots to choose from. Three current  best sellers are:



The Acer Aspire AS5750Z-4835 is one notebook worth a look and offers all the basics of a cheap notebook in a 15.6 inch package with 4GB RAM, 500GB hard drive and a 15.6 inch display.



The Asus A53U-EH11 is another cheap laptop that&#8217;s feature packed with and AMD dual core processor, 3GB of RAM and a 320GB hard drive and at under $350.00, this is one of the cheapest notebooks you can buy today.



Don&#8217;t discount a chromebook either. The Samsung series 5 chromebook is an option as there&#8217;s less hassle with OS stuff and viruses. If you live in a web browser, this could be the perfect notebook for you.

**Laptops $500 to $1000**

<div>
</div>

If screen real estate is what you need the HP g7-1310us is a hard deal to beat for a 17 inch notebook, especially for the price of just over $500.



If the thought of lugging around a big screen notebook all day brings shivers up your spine, check out the Dell Inspiron i14RN-1227BK. At just under $500 this 14 inch beauty shaves weight off the traditional laptop and is cheaper than an Ultrabook.



And speaking of Ultrabooks, now that they are dropping in price, they are a much cheaper alternative to an Apple offering and are the cheapest and are the best laptops and notebooks you can buy today.



These notebooks are just a taste of what&#8217;s available when shopping for a laptop and all I would consider affordable laptops.

I don&#8217;t know why, but next to some pretty shady memory stores (that I don&#8217;t list), the next area where you can get into trouble when shopping online is when you buy a digital camera.

[**The Nikon D5100 is the best selling digital camera**][1]

[<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4739" title="Nikon D5100 deal" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Screen-Shot-2012-05-31-at-8.42.17-AM.png" alt="Best Selling Digital Camera" width="310" height="304" />][1]

You want to be sure you&#8217;re buying a camera that comes in the original box, with all the accessories and packaging too and most important  of all, the warranty card.

You know the saying about how if the price is too good to be true, it is. Well, this applies to camera buying as well and especially with the warranties missing from some camera manufacturers you need to certain that the camera you buy will be supported, especially when you buy a digital SLR camera that tends to be pretty expensive, and why when you shop online for digital slr&#8217;s the prices you see from some online vendors can sure be enticing.

But in the long term, they&#8217;re not. Some sellers will sell you just the camera body and take out all the accessories, and some online stores try to sell you gray market cameras. These are cameras that were manufactured for one market, but end up being sold in another. An example  would be the [Nikon D800 ][2]&#8211;  a very popular and very expensive digital SLR on sale right now, and a perfect candidate for a grey market SLR.

You want to ensure the Nikon D800 (or any camera you buy) is manufactured for market intended. Differences may be slight or not at all, but if you buy a grey market camera it will not have any warranty. In my case, I want Nikon USA to support my Nikon SLR in the case there&#8217;s a problem with the camera.

It&#8217;s pretty easy to buy a camera online safely. Buy from trusted vendors you have heard of. If Jim&#8217;s Camera  store is offering a too good to be true discount on the camera &#8211; guess what? it really is  too good to be true.

I have found that when buying cameras online, **[Amazon][3]**  continues to offer the best selling cameras at the best  prices and you can be sure you are buying a camera with all the accessories and warranty support you need.

<br>

		<div class="post-content">These computers are usually returned computers for various reasons that have been inspected by Apple, cleaned and then put back out on sale at a discounted price. If you&#8217;re patient and wait for the perfect refurbished Mac to appear you can save money on what essentially may be a brand new Mac.

One way to get a better price or great deal on an Apple computer is to buy a refurbished Apple Computer.

[Apple][1] of course is an excellent source for refurbished Macs and also other products too from Apple such as refurbished iPads and iPods too.

Examples of refurbished Macs currently available are:

[Apple MacBook Pro 17 inch.][2] Save $200  
[Apple MacBook Pro 13.3 inch][3] Save $100  
[Apple MacBook 15 inch][4] Save $120.00

**Refurbished iPads  
** Another great way to get an iPad deal on an essentially new Apple iPad is to buy refurbishe too, and here&#8217;s a few examples of the savings you may expect when compared to the prices of a brand new Apple iPad

[Apple iPad (1st Generation 32GB Wifi)][5] Save $70.00  
[ Apple iPad 2 (32GB Wifi) ][6]Save $87.00  
[ Apple iPad (1st Generation 64GB Wifi)][7] Save $170.00

As you can see from the few examples above, these are pretty good deals on Apple certified and refurbished products and it&#8217;s a great way to save money when buying  Apple computers  as they can be expensive when compared to other PC&#8217;s using Windows.

Mac Mall is another source you should  check for deals on Apple products as I find that they offer more selection than even the Apple Store and they tend to offer a deal of some sort too &#8211;  something that Apple does not, save for the discounted refurbished price.

Buying refurbished Apple Products is one of the better ways to save on Apple products, regardless of whether you&#8217;re in the market for an iPad, or Apple Macintosh computer.

   <B> <h1><a href="/2012/05/what-kind-of-ram-do-i-have/">What Kind of RAM Do I Have?</a></h1></B>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content">Recently, I wrote about memory finders being a perfect way to buy more memory for your Mac or PC  if you&#8217;re looking to buy more memory, but what if you just want to find out what kind of RAM you have installed in your desktop or notebook computer already?

**Find RAM on Macintosh**

On the Mac, it&#8217;s easy.

1. Go to the Apple Menu and select About This Mac

2. You&#8217;ll see the amount of memory and type of RAM

3. If you click &#8216;more info&#8217;  there&#8217; s a memory tab that displays the amount of ram installed, how many slots are in use by the ram installed and the type of RAM installed.

**Windows 7**

1. Click **Start**

2. Right click **computer** and then **properties**

3. In the system section you can see the installed RAM you have.

**Ubuntu**

Boot into Ubuntu if you  haven&#8217;t already done so.

Select **Applications** from the top left corner.

Select  **Accessories** and then **Terminal**

Type  the word **top** and the ram installed should be beside **Mem::**

If you&#8217;re more interested in finding out what brand of RAM you have, then the only way I know how to do this is to physically inspect the RAM as most RAM brands are not displayed in any memory information tool, regardless of operating system.

My Mac Mini shipped with Hynix RAM when I went to replace the 4GB of Mac Mini RAM with 8GB (I went with **[Crucial from Amazon][1]** as my wife was buying some books at the same time and we get free shipping)  but the Hynix memory upgrades worked just fine for me, as does the Crucial upgrades.

When shopping for ram upgrades I would be more concerned that you have the correct memory speed and  type installed as opposed to buying ram brands. RAM either works or it doesn&#8217;t and all ram built or sold by the memory stores I list will do you just fine and come with money back guarantees in the rare event there is a problem.

   <B> <h1><a href="/2012/05/computer-memory-test-how-to-test-installed-ram/">Computer Memory Test: How To Test Installed RAM</a></h1></B>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content">Most, if not all RAM you buy today is tested by the memory manufacturer or reseller before it gets shipped to you or installed in your computer when you buy it, but even with these failsafe measurements in place, it does happen that  sometimes your computer will start to act up and one cause of the PC&#8217;s troubles could be the RAM has gone bad.

There&#8217;s also the chance that the operating system you are running doesn&#8217;t like to run the memory you have installed. This is rare though and usually happens when an OS update is performed.  It&#8217;s been a decade or more since I&#8217;ve seen RAM go bad due to and OS change.

But, **RAM does go bad**, as does hard drives (which is  why you should always have a backup too) and there&#8217;s many free ram testers out there to help you determine if your RAM has gone bad or not.

1. [MemTest][1]. This memory testing software is completely free to use and the most popular memory testing tools to use today.

2. [Windows Memory Diagnostic.][2]. If you&#8217;re on a Windows PC, this software comes built in to the operating system so you don&#8217;t need to download anything.  Just click start, control panel and search for memory in the search box and click &#8216;diagnose your computer&#8217;s  memory problems&#8217;

These two programs will help you determine the health of your installed memory upgrades on your Mac or PC. If you do find you have bad RAM, contact the computer memory manufacturer to determine if your installed RAM applies for a warranty replacement as most memory stores today offer a lifetime guarantee  on the ram upgrades they sell.
