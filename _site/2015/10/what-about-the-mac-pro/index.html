	<div class="post-content"><p>William Gallagher (with Mike Wuerthele) ] <a href="http://www.macnn.com/articles/15/10/14/a.new.potential.mac.pro.chipset.arrived.some.time.ago.so.where.is.it.130846/">posted an article at MacNN</a> on what Apple might plan to do with the Mac Pro:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You look at the profile of the Mac Pro longingly, and you have to wonder whether it’s been forgotten.</p>

  <p>Of course, we thought that back in the beginning of 2013 when this new, cylindrical, tiny Mac Pro was announced. People had given up on ever seeing an update for the aluminum slab-side Mac Pro, they’d given up on Apple, and they felt that Apple had given up on its creative professional users, who were the company’s core audience for many years previously.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don’t think that Apple has forgotten about the Mac Pro, but it’s now a very specialized item that’s aimed at a specific group of users. Also now that the iMacs can be almost and <a href="http://barefeats.com/imac5k10.html">if not as fast</a> as the Mac Pros, I know that if I was in the Market for a new desktop and the speeds are about the same, I would want to buy the iMac because it includes a 5k display where the Mac Pro doesn’t. I think that feature alone would want me to chose the iMac.</p>

<p>The Mac Pro has never seen as regular updates as the other consumer based models and considering a 2013 Mac Pro is still holding it’s own over newer Macs, I don’t see the need for Apple to upgrade this model for some time yet.</p>
