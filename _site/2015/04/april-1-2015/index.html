	<div class="post-content"><p>I have long been curating ram prices online and now it’s time for a new approach. I have tried different approaches as the demand for ram prices have declined now that Apple and a lot of other manufacturers don’t allow for ram upgrades to be done by the end user but nothing has really resonated with me to date.</p>

<p>I had thought about just writing articles about Apple and the like, but I am no news site nor do I have the time or interest to grab all the news. Also, my interests are widespread and not just Apple. I am interested in books, photography and other subjects just like you are, and over the course of the day I tend to visit these sites related to these topics and some times they have good stuff that at very least is worth a look and this is where I plan to do this from now on, and link out as much as I can</p>

<p>If you’re interested in just Apple news curated there a a lot of sites that do it better than I ever could like <a href="http://www.macintouch.com">Macintouch</a>, <a href="http://www.macsurfer.com">Macsurfer</a> for news and <a href="http://www.macprices.net">MacPrices</a> and <a href="http://www.dealnews.com">DealMac</a> for deals on Apple stuff and more but I need to have a place to share the stuff I find online in addition to just tracking ram prices and I figure that April Fool’s day is the perfect time to start such an adventure.</p>

<p>From time to time I may write an article or two when I have a thought or idea that I want to expand on further, but I will stick to what I do best – and that’s curate the stuff that interests me – just like ram and memory prices did so many years ago when I first started this site. And speaking of ram prices, I <strong>will still track them</strong> and you can find the perfect ram for your Mac from the menus on the top of the page just like always. Whether you’re looking to upgrade the ram on a ten year old iBook or the latest iMac (one of the few Apple computers you can still add ram upgrades to) there will still be a memory upgrade price chart for you to check. RAM price updates are not going anywhere.</p>

They  also track memory prices too. I thought I was the only one left that was still doing this.</p>
