<p>With Apple’s release of the 2015 MacBook Pro refreshes earlier this month there’s a few things you might want to know about the 2015 MacBook Pro models vs the 2014 versions:</p>

<h2 id="not-all-macbook-pros-are-the-same">Not All MacBook Pros Are The Same</h2>

<p>Only Some of the [MacBook Pro models saw an upgrade][1]. The 15 inch models did not get an upgrade at all and are still stuck with 2014 specifications. In fact, only 3 models got an upgrade for 2015:</p>

<p>13 inch 2.7Ghz with Retina Display (128GB and 256GB) and the 13 inch 2.9Ghz with retina display.</p>

<p>All others are still stuck on last year’s specifications with the 13 inch 2.5Ghz non retina display model being the only 13 inch MacBook Pro without an upgrade. The 15 inch display also did not see an upgrade at all either.</p>

<p>If you want to buy a new MacBook Pro for 2015 so far it will be one of the 3 that saw the updates.</p>

<h2 id="macbook-pros-are-still-expensive">MacBook Pros are Still Expensive</h2>

<p>Maybe the ‘pro’ in the name should have been the giveaway but these are still priced at over a thousand dollars for even the cheapest MacBook Pro you can buy at $1099.00 and really can’t compare with the other models with more RAM, faster processors, <strong>much faster storage</strong> [1][2]{#fnref-storage.footnote} and a much nicer screen</p>

<p>So really, the bargain of the bunch when it comes to the new MacBook Pro models are the 13 inch 2.7Ghz Retina display models. With 8GB of RAM standard on the $1299.00 model, the only difference between the 2.7Ghz models are the size of the storage. If you want more storage the upgrade from 128GB to 256GB is $200.00.</p>

<p>The most expensive 13 inch MacBook Pro for 2015 is the 2.9Ghz with a 7% increase in speed over the 2.7Ghz models you might want to ask yourself if it’s really worth it to buy the most expensive model that starts at $1799.00 for the high end 13 incher.</p>

<p>The 15 inch models even get stupider and cost $1999.00 and $2499.00. The <strong>cheap</strong> 15 inch model is 2.2GHz with 16GB of RAM and 256GB storage and the most expensive MacBook Pro you can buy is 2.5Ghz and 16GB of RAM with 512GB SSD storage.</p>

<p>Now you do get a bigger screen with the 15 inch vs 13 inch models so you might want to think about how much screen real estate you really need. The difference in size and weight is another thing to consider and not just the cost.</p>

<h2 id="dont-buy-the-cheapest-macbook-pro">Don’t Buy The Cheapest Macbook Pro</h2>

<p>It’s old technology and you will hate it very soon. I can’t think of using anything but solid state storage in any notebook anymore and unless you really can’t afford anything else I can’t recommend this model. If you’re on a budget the cheapest Mac Portable you can buy is the [MacBook Air][3], and these saw an upgrade too this year and are still well under $1000 too.</p>

<h2 id="dont-buy-the-most-expensive-macbook-pro">Don’t Buy The Most Expensive MacBook Pro</h2>

<p>Unless you have money to burn, the higher end MacBook Pros are really not recommended at this time due to their older design so that leaves you with asking what 13 inch MacBook Pro to get?</p>

<p>I always look to get the middle model as I feel it has the best value. Of the three 13 inch models that were released in March 2015, the only difference between the two cheaper models are storage space and the fact the most expensive model costs a lot more with just a small increase in speed and some more storage makes me wonder if I need all that speed and storage.</p>

<p>I guess it all comes down to what you plan to do with your MacBook? If you’re blogging and checking email then the 2.7Ghz Retina display at $1299.00 would be my pick but if you have to make money with your MacBook Pro and time is money then maybe it’s worth it to buy the <strong>most expensive model</strong> and know that you have the fastest Apple notebook you can buy today</p>

<p>But if it were my money, I would pick the $1299.00 model as 128GB of storage is just fine for me when it comes to storage space.</p>

<h2 id="the-new-models-have-force-trackpads">The New Models Have Force Trackpads</h2>

<p>Do you need a force trackpad? Probably not – at least right now that there’s minimal support for it and until a week or so this didn’t even exist, but you might as well get the one model of the MacBook Pro that has <strong>all the features</strong> and the 13 inch models feature this new technological advance in trackpads so you may as well buy a future proof trackpad instead of something with older technology</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>Do your homework when shopping for a new MacBook Pro and I am sure you will find a model that suits your needs and budget and will last you a very long time compared to other Windows or Linux notebooks.</p>
