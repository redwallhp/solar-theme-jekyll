<p>The Apple iPhone 4 and 4s models are pretty old now in 2014 but that doesn’t mean that they are two old for use or that they won’t make a good secondary phone or if you don’t need to have the fastest iPhone out there you can get some pretty good deals on older Apple iPhone 4 and iPhone 4S models.</p>

<h2 id="do-you-need-ios-8">Do you need iOS 8?</h2>

<p>The big difference between the two phones, and the first I want to mention is support for iOS 8. If you’re on the fence between the two models is that the 4 taps out at iOS 7 but the 4s can run iOS 8. There have been a lot of improvements to iOS 8 from iOS 7 but if you’re a casual user of your iPhone the 4s still runs the latest OS and can be bought for under $200.00.</p>

<h2 id="how-much-do-you-want-to-spend-on-an-apple-iphone">How Much Do You Want To Spend on an Apple iPhone?</h2>

<p>The Apple iPhone 4 will be the cheaper option and because this phone does not run the latest operating system there’s less demand for these phones, yet they’re still perfectly fine for some and the best part is they can be bought for under $100.00</p>

<p> </p>

<div id="asa-42a76b9a3a38eb8015e48819779a2503" class="asa_async_container asa_async_container_default">

<h2 id="what-iphone-features-do-you-need">What iPhone Features Do You Need?</h2>

<p>The big difference between the two iPhone models are besides the operating system is speed. The Apple iPhone 4s features an A5 Apple processor while the Apple iPhone offers an A4 processor that’s half as fast as the newer iPhone.</p>

<p>Do you need the speed? If you’re looking to run iOS 8 vs iOS 7 then the answer is yes. If you’re okay with saving money on an older iPhone and can live with iOS 7 then the slower iPhone might not feel all that slower in real life.</p>

<h2 id="hello-siri">Hello, Siri?</h2>

<p>The iPhone 4s supports Siri while the iPhone 4 doesn’t.</p>

<p>These 3 features are the three main items that differentiate the two models.</p>

<p>If you’re looking to buy a budget or refurbished phone, the Apple iPhone 4s is the phone I suggest you buy. The older iPhone 4 does not offer the speed to run the latest OS and the other features and would be my biggest disappointment. Add to the fact, the older iPhone 4 is much slower and the iPhone 4 does not look like a bargain.</p>

<p>Rerfurbished Apple iPhone 4s models can be bought for under $200 in most cases – a fraction of what it would cost to buy an iPhone 6, and yet both of these phones pretty can run the same OS and offer the same user experience for the most part.</p>
