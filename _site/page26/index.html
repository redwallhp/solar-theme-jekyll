   <B> <h1><a href="/2012/05/the-dell-memory-selector-you-can-get-a-better-deal-on-memory-upgrades/">The Dell Memory Selector: You Can Get A Better Deal on Memory Upgrades</a></h1></B>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>This should be common knowledge to anybody who’s even remotely familiar with computer memory but in case you’ve missed it – you can do better on ram prices when you buy ram elsewhere.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://accessories.us.dell.com/sna/memconfig.aspx?c=us&amp;l=en&amp;s=bsd&amp;cs=04">Dell Memory Selector </a> is really handy for finding out what memory upgrades you need for dell both new and old and over the years, there have been a lot of dell computers released and it’s always a good ideal to add ram to whatever model you choose but the ram prices from Dell seem to be high when you compare the prices on memory upgrades from other memory manufacturers:</p>

<p>Let’s use an example: The Dell Inspiron 15 is one of the most popular Dell laptops today and to buy <a href="http://accessories.us.dell.com/sna/category.aspx?c=us&amp;l=en&amp;s=bsd&amp;cs=04&amp;category_id=4325&amp;mfgpid=224725&amp;chassisid=-1">memory for the Dell Inspiron 15 from Dell </a>is pretty expensive when you compare the prices to other memory manufacturers and retailers.</p>

<p>Dell charges $38 for 4GB of RAM currently which really is a lot more realistic than the $400 Apple wants for the ram upgrades for their MacBook Pro lineup. Assuming you will need to buy two 4GB DDR3 1333Ghz laptop memory modules to maximize the memory on your Dell, you’re looking at just under $80.00 to max out the dell notebook ram if you buy direct from Dell.</p>

<p>Compare this to <strong><a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT2KIT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1339">memory from Crucial Technology</a></strong> (or others in the pricing table for dell notebook memory below) where you can buy the exact same upgrade for a bit over $40.00 currently. (again, prices may change – see prices below for current dell notebook ram prices ).</p>

<p>That’s a half price discount, or close to – all by doing about 30 seconds of research and looking for alternative sources for Dell Memory Upgrades, other than buying ram from Dell Directly.</p>

<p>Now, if saving money on RAM is not your first and foremost concern, and you want Dell to install RAM in your new Dell notebook than the extra $40 or so you pay for RAM from dell compared to other cheaper sources may be worth it as now you don’t have to install the Dell memory upgrade yourself and can let a certified Dell Technician install the ram into your brand new Dell notebook.</p>

   <B> <h1><a href="/2012/05/web-hosting-shopping-a-look-at-11-web-hosting-plans/">Web Hosting Shopping: A Look at 1&#038;1 Web Hosting Plans</a></h1></B>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>There was a time when I didn’t really care about web hosting and happily paid three thousand dollars a year or more for a dedicated web server to host this site (and others), but as the demand for RAM has leveled off and the ram prices have dropped, I am starting to look for ways to save money on my annual web hosting bill.</p>

<p>**I’m with <a href="http://www.pair.com">Pair</a>. **</p>

<p>A few years back, I switched platforms to use wordpress instead of my ever so more complicated html setup. I’ve had a few complaints about tracking the ram prices for the older macs, but my research shows you folks are not looking for ram for older Macs so I now just concentrate on the newer Apple computer models as those are the Macs people are buying and need to upgrade the RAM on. I can speak from personal experience that the only time I have ever bought RAM is when I needed to upgrade the RAM on a brand new Mac – most recently being an Apple Mac Mini I upgraded with 8gb of RAM.</p>

<p>Anyway, back to the web hosting: In an effort to cut costs I transferred this site to shared hosting and except for the odd burp in service, I don’t really have any complaint with them except for the fact that for shared hosting – at $85.00 a month they’re kind of pricey when I compare other web hosting packages available online.</p>

<p>This will, I think be the first in a series of web hosting plan comparisons I hope to do as I can’t help myself – I like to shop and get the best price on stuff, whether it’s web hosting or memory upgrades and 1&amp;1 web hosting is the first host I found alphabetically so I’ll start there:</p>

<p><strong>1&amp;1 Web Hosting Plans</strong></p>

<p>The good folks at 1&amp;1 offer a few plans but the best web hosting from 11 web hosting costs just a little over 3 bucks a month. Even with the 25% discount I got from Pair networks that’s still a significant savings over the $80 a month I am paying now for web hosting. a</p>

<p>I really don’t need a lot for my web hosting needs, as this is just a blog and I bet that any old host would work for my site and traffic load. I would need some mysql databases for the wordpress databases and unlimited traffic and storage space that this cheap web hosting plan from 11 web hosting offers.</p>

<p>I don’t care less about free domain names, email accounts, ssl certificates and or dual hosting. I may be inclined to upgrade the hostin to their business web hosting as opposed to their personal plan, only for the fact that the performance may be better and I think the faster ramseeker is the better.</p>

<p>I can always pay more for web hosting later too, as I have yet to find any business that will not take more money than you are currently paying.</p>

   <B> <h1><a href="/2012/05/what-is-the-best-selling-laptop-brand-of-2012/">What is the Best Selling Laptop Brand of 2012?</a></h1></B>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>A lot of times, the best selling notebook of the year is also going to be the cheapest notebook of the year too as you can get a lot of notebook for very little money these days, and if you’re just going to be surfing the internet or writing documents with your laptop you don’t need to buy a high powered gaming notebook for that to happen. If this is the case, then all you need to do is buy the cheapest notebook you can buy.**<br />
Price<strong>When shopping for a new laptop, one way to decide on what laptop to buy this year is to take the easy way out and **just  buy the laptop everybody else is buying</strong>.  This sure takes the guesswork out of having to decide on what notebook to buy but there are other factors to consider when notebook shopping in 2012:</p>

<p><strong>Screen Size </strong></p>

<p>The best sellers in the notebook department also tend to be those with the smallest screens as screen size determines price more than any other component on a notebook computer today. If you want a bigger screen notebook, be prepared to pay for the additional  screen real estate.</p>

<p><strong>Power</strong></p>

<p>Fast  Processors are going to cost more and likely not as popular due to price, than if you were to buy a cheaper notebook computer with a slower chip.</p>

<p><strong>RAM and Hard Drives</strong></p>

<p>When notebook shopping you want to  be sure to buy the notebook with the most RAM and hard drive space. In 2012, that translates to RAM with 4GB and about 500GB hard drive space for entry level notebooks – especially when you’re shopping for notebooks under $500.</p>

<h2 id="best-laptop-brands-in-2012">Best Laptop Brands in 2012</h2>

<p>I’ll try to keep this updated, and this will easily change over time, but you really can’t go wrong with the following notebook computer brands:</p>

<p><strong>Apple </strong></p>

<p>You’ll pay a premium for this brand, and it’s arguable whether an Apple notebook is worth the extra money  but these notebooks are constantly on the best selling notebook lists year after year.</p>

<p><strong>Lenovo</strong> is another brand that’s popped up recently and it’s probably doe in part to the fact that you can buy their laptops so cheaply – some are priced as low as $399. Try getting a Mac notebook for that little.</p>

<p><strong>Acer</strong> ranks number  3 currently and I really don’t know why as they tend to have a very extensive lineup of notebooks this year – from more traditional notebooks to the ultra light ultrabooks. If you had to pick any notebook brand, I would say that Acer  will have a laptop that would suit your needs.</p>

<p>**HP **Personally, I have had bad luck with a HP notebook so  I am reluctant to recommend this brand, but I suppose I shouldn’t let one bad apple ruin the bunch</p>

<p><strong>Asus</strong> is a brand of notebook I haven’t used much but they are in the top ten best selling notebooks  right now so I must include this brand too.</p>

<p>Unless you consider Apple, all the others ship with Windows 7 as the defacto operatings system and of course, I suggest  you max out the ram in all of them.</p>

<p><strong>Where To Buy The Best Laptop Brands?</strong></p>

<p>I have a hard time beating  any price on any notebook and suggest you <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/electronics/565108/?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957"><strong>buy your 2012 notebook at Amazon</strong> </a>as they stock every item under the sun and have the best notebook prices I have seen this year to date.</p>

   <B> <h1><a href="/2012/05/what-is-a-good-amount-of-ram/">What is a Good Amount of RAM?</a></h1></B>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>8GB  of RAM is enough for most of  us.</p>

<p>There was a time when ram mattered more and I’m loathe to say this  because I feed my family with the stuff – there’s a good chance the RAM installed  is enough. In 2012, and on a notebook computer that means you’ll usually have about 4GB of ram installed, or if you end up buying an older computer you may have 1GB of RAM or maybe 2.</p>

<p>Netbooks are another story. In an effort to keep the cost of the netbook down  the computer manufacturers skimp on RAM and if there were ever an increase in performance for your netbook that’s  super cheap  then adding RAM is the ticket.</p>

<p>But if you’re surfing and blogging and maybe running a small video or photo editing with your notebook (or desktop too) than you will be OK with 8GB of RAM.</p>

<p><strong>What about 16GB? </strong></p>

<p><strong>**Some notebooks today ship with 4GB and could be upgraded to 16GB. The Apple MacBook Pro is one such notebook. The problem I find with buying and installing 16GB of RAM  into your notebook is that even with the recent **<a href="http://www.amazon.com/mn/search/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;field-keywords=16gb%20notebook%20memory&amp;url=search-alias%3Delectronics&amp;sprefix=16gb%20notebook%2Celectronics%2C213">price drops on 16GB notebook memory</a> </strong>you still end up paying more for 16GB of RAM.</p>

<p>A case study that’s far from scientific is I am writing this on a<strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/mn/search/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;field-keywords=16gb%20notebook%20memory&amp;url=search-alias%3Delectronics&amp;sprefix=16gb%20notebook%2Celectronics%2C213#/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias=electronics"> 2011 Mac Mini  </a></strong> and with 8Gb installed I still have 3GB of RAM free. I have over a dozen applications  open and to be honest I find no need to buy more RAM than 8GB.</p>

<p>This will change over time as the 16GB prices keep on dropping and dropping, it’s only a small matter of time before you can buy 16GB of RAM, but for now – <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002YUF8ZG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002YUF8ZG">8GB of RAM will do you just fine</a>.</strong></p>

   <B> <h1><a href="/2012/05/macbook-air-vs-macbook-pro-for-2012/">MacBook Air vs MacBook Pro for 2012.</a></h1></B>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>Way back in August of 2011 I wrote about whether <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/should-i-buy-a-macbook-pro-now-in-august-or-should-i-wait-for-the-macbook-pro-2012/" title="Should I Buy a 2011 MacBook Pro Now in August, or should I wait for the MacBook Pro 2012?">I should buy a new MacBook Pro today</a> or whether I should wait for the 2012 MacBook Pros to arrive (I’ll wait – there has to be a new MacBook Pro released any day now)</p>

<p>But this got me thinking. What if you can’t wait to buy a MacBook Pro and you need one now? Do you go with the MacBook Air instead of MacBook Pro?</p>

<p>**2012 MacBook Air vs MacBook Pro **</p>

<p>To start, I’m comparing the 13 inch versions of these models as there isn’t a 15 inch MacBook Air and it wouldn’t surprise me if Apple discontinued the 17 inch MBP any day now. So this leaves us comparing the 2012 Apple MacBook Pro vs the 2012 MacBook Air – both with 13.3 inch displays.</p>

<p>**Advantages of MacBook Air<br />
**</p>

<p>Weight. It weigh less and for a portable computer this may be your buying decision right there.<br />
Hard Drive Speed. The SSD drive smokes the standard hard drive in the MacBook Pro<br />
Newer Technology when it comes to Airport speed and bluetooth technologies.</p>

<p><strong>Advantages of MacBook Pro</strong></p>

<p>Weight. I don’t care what the marketers would like you to believe – that extra pound and a half is a lot when it’s digging into your shoulder<br />
Price. The MacBook Pro is cheaper by $100.<br />
Speed. The MadcBook Pro is faster with a 2.4GHz processor compared to the MacBook Air’s 1.7GHz<br />
Memory.You can upgrade the MacBook Pro with more RAM. the MacBook Air you’re stuck with the default 4GB for the lifetime of the computer.<br />
Optical Drive. The MacBook Pro has one.<br />
Facetime HD video camera<br />
Thunderbolt port<br />
Backlit Keyboard<br />
Way more connections on the MacBook Pro. The Air is limited to thunderbolt and USB 2.0 and headphone and microphone.</p>

<p>As you can see, the advantage of the Air over the Pro this year so far is far lighter and the zippy SSD drive.</p>

<p>If you can handle the extra weight of the MacBook Pro, <strong>that’s the one I would buy</strong>. It’s $100 cheaper and less if you <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005CWIVYI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B005CWIVYI">buy the MacBook Pro at Amazon</a></strong>. It all depends on how you plan on using your notebook. For me, I plug the notebook into a LED display and external hard drive and only unplug it for couch surfing or the odd trip out for coffee for a change of scenery.</p>

<p>I vote for the MacBook Pro.</p>

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>This will be a short one. Almost every notebook pc built today in 2012 will use and accept DDR3 notebook memory and this applies to all brands of laptops – even the Mac vs PC – it doesn’t matter. And of course, you did know that laptop memory prices continue to drop over time and if you ever needed to buy RAM for your notebook, this is the time to do it.</p>

<p>Take a look how little RAM Prices are for laptop notebook RAM:<br />
[table id=7 /]</p>

<p>If you’ve been waiting for RAM prices to drop until they fall in price, now is the time to buy because they actually have been rising in price over the last few weeks so I would get into making your laptop go faster with RAM while you can. RAM prices may not continue to be so low.</p>

   <B> <h1><a href="/2012/05/how-i-made-a-cheap-music-server-from-a-20-dell/">How I Made a Cheap Music Server with a $20 Dell</a></h1></B>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>I spent $22.00 on my Dell Music Server to be exact.</p>

<p><img class=" wp-image-4253 " title="Cheap Music Server" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/JIM_3337-1024x680.jpg" alt="Dell Music Server" width="450" /></p>

<p>Over the years one might say my CD collection has grown some. I’m closing in on 1000 CD’s in my collection and I have a problem: My wife doesn’t like the space it takes. Thus my search began on how to manage my CD collection and at the same time be able to access all my music easily without the bulk and space requirements of a physical CD collection taking up space in our main living area, so my search began for a cheap music server to eventually replace my CD’s and CD Player.</p>

<p><strong>I really want to Buy a Mac Mini ** But like a lot of other folks, money is tight and **<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004YLCLM6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004YLCLM6">spending almost $600 on a Mac Mini</a></strong> really isn’t in the cards for now as there’s home repairs and other stuff like the mortgage that currently keeps our fiscal attention so for the time being, the Mac Mini has to wait. Paired with an iPhone or iPad this really could be the best way to manage your music for under $1000 <em>**</em> <em>*But what if I could make a cheap music server for a fraction of that cost? ** <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/JIM_3341.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-4255" title="JIM_3341" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/JIM_3341-1024x680.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="" /></a> *I did have to <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com">add more memory</a> to get my cheapo dell up and running </em> A bit of searching led me to <a href="http://www.vortexbox.org">vortexbox.org</a> and this is music server software that’s linux based and offers a free and easy way to make a music server out of pretty much any old PC you’ve got kicking around.  I could build a PC for this purpose  but by the time you’ve got the PC built you’re over $300 or more into it  and by that point I’d rather save my pennies and buy what I really want – a Mac Mini. (This might be a good topic to explore further though)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.vortexbox.org"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4271" title="VortexBox GUI Interface" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Screen-Shot-2012-04-30-at-7.43.48-PM-600x648.png" alt="" width="600" height="648" /></a></p>

<p> </p>

<p><em>The web user interface on the vortexbo</em></p>

<p>**So I searched eBay for some cheap desktop computers and found a <a href="http://www.ebay.com">Dell Optiplex 280 on ebay</a> that’s obviously been put to use in an office environment but is now off lease. It’s an older Intel P4 processor running  at 2.8GHz but it came with a fresh install of Windows XP, and 512mb of RAM and a 40GB hard drive – enough power to allow me to test the vortexbox software and see if it’s for me and whether I should invest in a faster PC in the future to use as a dedicated music server. As this is really just a hobby, I didn’t want to spend a whole lot of money on a music server just for a PC to test software with and this little $22 wonder got me off the ground to test. I did underestimate the ram requirements of the Vortexbox and had to find another 512mb of DDR2 to get the minimum 1GB of RAM required as the Dell only shipped with 512mb  of RAM and I needed 1GB  of RAM  to get this box up and running.</p>

<p><strong>The Beauty of Vortex Box</strong></p>

<p>You do have to be a bit of technical soul to work your way around vortexbox if you need to add more programs and change some settings  and  you may even have to work with a command line, but I found it relatively easy to do and have been able to get the media server online and I can play my music with Itunes with ease, which was the entire point. Once you have the vortexbox set up who cares if you only spent $20?</p>

<p><strong>Set It, and Forget It</strong>   <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/JIM_3338.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-4254" title="Rip a CD with ease" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/JIM_3338-1024x680.jpg" alt="It's easy to RIP a CD with vortexbox" width="600" height="" /></a> Simplicity  is why a Mac Mini is so attractive to me as I want to be able to replace my CD Player – a Rega Planet –   and have all my music in one place.  Once I change a few settings on the Mac Mini I can run the server headless and the Mac Mini is a wife-approved form factor in the living room that’s quiet. <strong>This is an important factor that must not be overlooked</strong>. But the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VSY66O/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001VSY66O">Vortex Box is a cheaper music server by far,</a> and once you get the server software installed on your PC you can run the music server anywhere there’s a network and power as all the management of the vortexbox is run through the easy to use web interface that you can access from any  PC or even a tablet with  a web browser. The best part about a music server is that it’s hidden from view and yet you can still access all your music and  the convenience far outweighs using storing and caring for a CD collection. In the case of the Dell this  was really just to play with rather than really use as a music server but the software did run on this old P4 computer with just 1GB of RAM, but save for the fact that it’s a slow computer to work with, once I had it setup as a music server I noticed no difference between using this computer due to a quad core PC. Thankfully, you really don’t need a lot of processing power to play music. If I tweaked the server, I could have done two things had I really wanted to use this Dell as my one and only music server:</p>

<p>I could have <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/review-western-digital-wd-scorpio-black-750-gb-2-5-inch-mobile-hard-drive/" title="Review: Western Digital WD Scorpio Black 750 GB  2.5-Inch Mobile Hard Drive">bought a bigger hard drive</a> to toss inside the Dell. I would use at least a 1TB drive, perhaps even a 2TB hard drive as the cost for the bigger drive isn’t that much more in price. Or – and this is the cheaper option. I have a 500GB external drive that would be put to use as  as an external source for my music. The hard drive doesn’t have to be inside the PC. You do have to configure the vortexbox installation to use an external drive for storage instead, but it is possible and this would be the cheaper option too as I already have the hard drive and it’s bought and  paid for. The best part of using the vortexbox is that you don’t have to touch the server once you have it configured. You can copy all your music to the external drive and hook it up and you’re done. I found no connection or other issues. The vortexbox served and played my music.</p>

<p><strong>Ease of Use</strong> But if your music is still on CD’s the Dell music server really shines as all you have to do to get the music onto your music server is to open the CD player, toss in a CD and shut the door. The PC does all the rest from getting the cover art to ripping the CD in flac format. When all the songs on the CD have been imported the drawer opens and you remove the CD and install another. Rinse, Lather, Repeat. As a test I tried to rip Van Morrison’s Best Of and the rip went fine but it did take a while – about 15 minutes. I think this speed could be increased with a faster processor. This is an older computer. But, if you’ve got the time, an old PC and enough storage there’s no reason why you couldn’t use your old PC as a music server with this free music server software   <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/JIM_3347.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-4256" title="JIM_3347" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/JIM_3347-1024x680.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="" /></a> **Buy a new vortexbox. ** If the thought of working and waiting for an old PC sends shivers down your spine you can take the easy way out and buy your own brand new vortexbox with a modern processor and the software installed and pre configured already:</p>

<p> </p>

<p>This modern music server uses the exact same software as on my $20 dell, but it’s wrapped in a faster processor and is ready to go out of the box. The cheap Dell does take some tweaking to get going, but once it’s running as you like you really don’t have to touch it I found. <strong>Summary. </strong> For  the money  I spent on the Dell Music Server I’m quite happy. You do have to be a bit more of a propellor  head  and you many even have to dip into the command line  to get things set the way you like but once you do , I  found  the vortexbox to be easy to use as both an iTunes ana DLNA server. <strong>Pros</strong>. cheap cheap cheap. and runs on almost any old PC. <strong>Cons</strong>. Would take some tweaking  to get my entire CD collection on, and at 15 minutes to RIP this might take a while.  Also, the fan is noisy on this PC. You can use it as a server, but not  a player in the same room.  There are other quieter PC’s out there</p>

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>This particular **Mac Pro from Apple **uses 240 pin sdram dimms and you don’t have to worry about  lack of memory slots with this Apple Mac Pro model  as there’s four banks of memory upgrade slots, and each memory bank contains two different memory upgrade slots on each bank, for a total of eight slots you can install memory for this Apple Mac Pro. From the Factory the **Mac Pro Dual Core 2.0 GHz **shipped with just 1GB of memory, which is almost pitiful in these times but you can do much better with the memory upgrades and max this Mac Pro Model out to 32gb of RAM.</p>

<p><strong>Where to Buy Memory for Apple Mac Pro Dual Core 2.0 GHz</strong></p>

<p>First,  I need to  tell you that vendors of memory upgrades for the Mac Pro’s list both memory upgrade kits and memory upgrade modules for the Mac Pro Dual Core 2.0 GHz.   As memory must be installed in matched pairs, or memory upgrade kit with this particular Mac Pro model, some vendors have chosen to sell and market the memory for this Mac Pro model in memory ugrade kits. This allows the customer to buy a matched pair of memory upgrades and know they don’t need anything else.</p>

<p>But, (and there’ always a but..) some vendors have chosen to stick to listing the memory upgrades for this Mac Pro in just single modules and will assume that the customer is wise enough to buy memory in matched pairs. It’s my opinion that this is a mistake as well..why make it harder than it needs to be to buy ram for your Mac Pro?</p>

<p>Anyway, I here are <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/240-pin-ddr2-pc5300-sdram-memory-upgrade-prices/" title="240 Pin DDR2 PC5300 SDRAM Memory Upgrade Prices"> <strong>memory modules for the Mac Pro</strong></a></p>

<p>With this info you can make  an educated decision when buying memory upgrades for your Apple Mac Pro 2.0GHz</p>

<p>here’s not a day goes by where I’m not asked the question:</p>

<p><strong>What kind of RAM do I need? What RAM and Memory Upgrades Should I Buy?</strong></p>

<p><strong style="line-height: 18px;"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I">Apple MacBook Pro. Best Selling NoteBook Today</a></strong></p>

<p><img class="size-full wp-image-1484 alignleft" title="Best Selling Notebook" alt="Best laptop" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Screen-shot-2011-03-26-at-2.24.37-PM.png" width="300" height="242" />Well, that depends. On the PC side of the memory equation you usually have more options and it’s easier to** find out what kind of memory you need for your computer** as the manufacturer and models names for the desktop and notebook computers are distinct for each computer manufacturer and model.</p>

<p>For example, If you  are looking to** upgrade your del<strong>l, and you have a **dell notebook</strong> you need memory upgrades for all you usually have to do is find out what model number that is and you’re usually off to the races. For an example: <strong>You need memory for your brand new Dell inspiron 14  or Inspiron 15 or even inspiron 17 models with core i3 and core i5 processors **that are **current notebook models from Dell</strong>, but would perform much better if you just <strong>added more memory.</strong> (as adding memory to most computers will offer: more ram equals faster software)</p>

<p>Right, so you’ve got the model name from Dell:  So you find any<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com"><strong>memory store</strong> </a>that you choose and each of these stores will offer a <strong>memory configurator **where you just plunk in your manufacturer and model name of your</strong> desktop or notebook <strong>and you’re returned with a list of **memory &amp; ram upgrades</strong> that match your computer.</p>

<p>Sounds Easy, Right? And it is: For this example, I’ll use<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial"><strong>Crucial Technology</strong></a><strong>,</strong> but you could pick from any <strong>vendor of memory</strong> I list on <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="ramseeker memory prices">ramseeker</a> as they all carry easy to use** memory configurators that will help you choose the right memory** and ram upgrades.</p>

<p>But for this example, I’ll use<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial"> Crucial Technology</a>: So I find my manufacturer: Which is in this case, Dell. And then I’ll choose <strong>Inspiron laptops/notebooks,</strong> and then lastly I find my model, for this example I will use Dell Inspiron 15 and I see theres’s two choices: One is just Dell inspiron 15, and the other  is <strong>dell inspiron 1564</strong>, The <strong>dell inspiron 15</strong> seems  to list a  little older types of memory  and I’m going go guess that the** dell inspiron 15 (1564) <strong>is the better choice for me as this model listing at crucial specifies</strong> DDR3 PC1066 memory modules <strong>which is the more recent of the two listings and also a quick reference of the dell website specifies that the **dell inspiron 15  that’s currently offered does require the DD3 PC-8500 memory modules</strong>.</p>

<p>And that’s it.  A bit of research, and I’ve got a <strong>new ram and memory upgrade ordered for my Dell Inspiron 15 notebook</strong> computer.</p>

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>Apple iTunes is in my opinion, the best Apple software for the Mac and the best part is that it’s included in each and every  Mac you buy</p>

<p>But, over the years iTunes has grown in size to the point where it allows you to buy new music, buy  new videos and TV shows and more at the iTunes store. All this takes more and more processing power over time to the point where if you don’t have a relatively new Apple computer you may not be able to run the current Generations of iTunes at all.</p>

<p><strong>Apple iTunes Requirements </strong></p>

<p>For the Mac, you need at least 512 mb of RAM and either a G4, G5 or Intel Mac for the Application to run. If you have the need to play standard definition video, the requirements rise to at least a 1Ghz G4 and still jus 512mb of RAM.</p>

<p>High Definition Video is where the ram and processor requirements for Apple iTunes really dial up: For 720p high definition video the minimum possible is a 2.0 Ghz Intel Core 2 Duo processor, with twice the  amount  of RAM at 1GB. And if you want full 1080p high definition, the bar gets raised higher at 2.4Ghz Intel Core Duo and 2GB of RAM.</p>

<p>So, if  you’re just playing music, it seems you can get away with an <a href="http://www.lowendmac.com">older Mac</a>, but if you want to use HD video you’ll need a newer Mac (<a href="http://www.everymac.com">from about 2008 and up</a>).</p>

<p>Depending on the speed and RAM on your current computer, you might be able to upgrade the RAM or you may have to buy a brand new Mac to get full HD. The Apple Mac Mini is my favorite Mac for iTunes use as it’s small, quiet and one of the <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004YLCLM6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004YLCLM6">cheapest Mac computers you can buy</a></strong>.</p>
