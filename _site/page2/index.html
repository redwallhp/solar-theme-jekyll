  <p>Many price comparison websites use robots to gather pricing information from various vendors.

As opposed to these sites, we use a real person to update our prices each morning. We visit the reseller’s website to see the prices and bundles with our own eyes, and if that fails, we pick up the telephone and give them a call.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Launched in 2003, the Power Mac G5 was the king of Apple’s lineup for about three years, moving from single CPU models to an eventual dual core and quad core lineup. The G5 was discontinued in 2006 to make way for Apple’s switch to Intel processors. If you get your hands on one or keep one lying around for video or legacy projects, you’ll find that it still packs a solid punch for a ten year old computer. Below are some suggestions on how to maximize your Power Mac to extend its life.</p>

I don’t really use the evernote stuff much but the markdown writing and preview experience is very nice.</p>

<p>There’s apps available, but they’re pretty much the same as firing up the browser of choice and visiting:</p>

  <p>Marxico is a delicate Markdown editor for Evernote. With reliable storage and sync powered by Evernote, Marxico offers greate writing experience.</p>

  <p>Versatile - supporting code highlight, LaTeX &amp; flow charts, inserting images &amp; attachments by all means.
Exquisite - neat but powerful editor, featuring offline docs, live preview, and offering the desktop client and offline Chrome App.
Sophisticated - deeply integrated with Evernote, supporting notebook &amp; tags, two-way bind editing.</p>

<p>I really like that it allows you to connect to your github account and make changes directly from the app.</p>

<p>And, because it’s online and browswer based - you can use this to write from anywhere.</p>

<p>My only complaint, is that I get an error when connecting and retrieving files from Google Drive, so as much as I like this - I will still stick to using Calmly Writer as my current writing tool of choice.</p>

<p>Regardless, it’s a nice little web app.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I think we’ve come to the end of the big forward leaps in processing power. We may see 3- and 4-core processors and higher clock speeds, but even then don’t expect to see a tripling – or even doubling – of performance from one iPhone generation to the next.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think he’s right. I have jumped from an iPhone 4s to 5 and an iPad Mini as the 3 apple iOS devices and to be honest - they all work great and the speed doesn’t seem all that different to me. The reviews state the iPhone SE to be super fast, but when I quickly demoed one the other day at Best Buy, I came away unimpressed.</p>

<p>There used to be a day when speed mattered more. Now, I think it’s battery life that does.</p>

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>I know other sites in the Apple community like to stick to the tried and true and look pretty much the same since the day they were launched, I get bored with the look of ramseeker and like to change things up from time to time.</p>

<p>Heck, it’s only been <a href="http://ramseeker.com/2015/10/the-new-look/">six months</a> since the last time I made changes to the look of ramseeker and here I am doing it again.</p>

<p>In the past, the changes were for the most part were cosmetic and usually due to a new wordpress theme I wanted to try but now I have gone and switched both the technology powering this site as well as the web hosting provider.</p>

<p>In short, I have come full circle. When I stared ramseeker in 1997 as a hobby site the site was static and if I recall, probably built with <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/1014811/pagemill.html">pagemill</a>.</p>

<p>Later on, I switched to a dynamic site with php and a mysql database because that was the new technolgy and it allowed me to offer almost real-time price change info for memory upgrades here on ramseeker.</p>

<p>But to keep the speed up to the same speed as the static site, I had to change the web hosting to a much more expensive dedicated server from <a href="http://pair.com">pair networks</a>, and this helped to a certain degree, but over time it seemed like I always had to spend money on more ram for the server, or more space or some other cost, so in 2011 I said goodbye to pair networks and switched ramseeker over to using Wordpress as it was all the rage online as a quick and easy way to get a website built.</p>

<p>Since then I have tried various webhost for my wordpress site, but there always seemed to be a problem like waking up to finding you were hacked or monitoring theme, wordpress and plugin updates.</p>

<p>A switch to managed wordpress hosting removed most of my update worries as it was taken care of for me but it was still costly. Not as costly as my dedicated server, but still it was money out of my pocket.</p>

<p>I never really did like working with wordpress. I always found it a pain that I had to wait for a completely new page to preview my post before I hit the publish button and the plugins seemed to grow and grow and grow.</p>

<p>I have tried working with different themes as well but I never did find one that I really loved.</p>

<p>I had read about static website hosting and found <a href="http://www.jekyllrb.com">jekyll</a> and github pages. At first, the learning curve was pretty high as I had never used a terminal much being an Apple user I was used to launching apps and using WYSISWYG tools to create this site.</p>

<p>I had to learn the workings of <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">jekyll</a>, git and getting the site on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">github pages</a> and have given up in frustration in the past many times, but I was always intrigued by Jekyll and static sites because Wordpress is much more of a CMS then I ever would need.</p>

<p>It’s taken some time, but I have finally made the switch.</p>

<p>Getting my posts and pages out of Wordpress to Jekyyl was pretty easy thanks to an export plugin and now that my entire site is on my hard drive (actually google drive) in just text file format, I don’t have to worry about my web hosting service dying because I have a folder of my entire site backed.</p>

<p>I prefer to <a href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html">blog like a hacker </a> and use a simple text editor to write my posts and then push my changes to github via the terminal as it scrathes my inner geek (I do monitor ram prices after all), but github pages also offers a web-based way to blog via <a href="http://prose.io">prose.io</a> which allows you to blog in a format similar to to using Wordpress.</p>

<p>I have found that writing in markdown is much easier than stopping your writing to select formatting when all I need is a couple of keyboard shortcuts to get what I need.</p>

<p>Lastly, there’s the speed and cost benefits.</p>

<p>Because Jekyll creates just static pages and not much else there’s never any database calls or other technology to slow down page load speed. In fact, I think the only extra I have here is a call to Google Analytics for my website stats.</p>

<p>I know wordpress offers caching plugins, but I spent too much time working with the technology behind the site instead of the site itself, and I hope this switch will allow me to concentrate on the latter instead of the former.</p>

<p>And the price can’t be beat. I’m using <a href="http://atom.io">free software</a> to write this article and then publishing to <strong><a href="https://pages.github.com">free web hosting</a></strong>.</p>

<p>That’s right. <strong>free</strong>, as in beer.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/7dpMXem8SnmJulxNjiPdnDMnWm-aUGY9cMStBbE3QjOqT1bwk1i_r2CkYIFpJo1W9zd9zAdF5G-NB2fBVYVzs_FqH5Z-5lgXyykKxtZhoSXtzSR45SZf70wAcZNEiq6ngcTe4wP7l8aSuzrGZOUrTkmpmjYOKIfZ2zpBKZFZQ7Fhcn_OB2w2xOMKL7SM1mOWBsQ3GJxqWSLKOiIdsn8kxbK5Ia6v5yNhPHgt08u8tq4uV0HVnWuiBAsTB-5EfNq18KNapZJi_ts8zS6EMCGaKQCQ-R12hVqXI12HXSSZ0D0RHDuW0QblhWFnF7S5mzMpSHuGTZwbZi4EfVthjtgedhF2Y_2oOTcVwqRoEcNu4hPjkje34wZZyKWaXdSHgxZ2YRXZFub6Rl0rV0bIJVWA582ahuPa-d1YRVONXtrq8wxVwxL_8btkNseWtXYIBsKTYYzA1IjsNJUS3rr8e5oyeGr84mfr96vEgdpwEkgr9HWpFzFZq_eTMU_Si5uSoqCn8kHxqTUVXcNFLvt8dfKPi4IQib5HV1jXDqMIl2hIbRQzxLx8gJJPV6mT7illcPatddYerQ=w924-h662-no" alt="" /></p>

<p>Previously my last wordpress hosting service was costing close to $100 monthly and free is much better than coughing up a hundred bucks a month. That money could buy me a new computer each and every year with ease if I wanted too instead.</p>

<p>I think that’s a much better deal. In fact, almost too good. It did take me some time to make the switch but now that I have, I am very glad I have.</p>

<p>I have also trimmed down the design to the bare minumum. The free (again) theme I am using is <a href="https://github.com/nickbalestra/kactus">Kactus</a> which is based on <a href="http://cactusformac.com/">Cactus for Mac</a>. It’s a clean look and the only mods I have made is to add some ram prices to the top of the page, and as mentioned above - Google Analytics.</p>

<p>To summarize I am really pleased with the latest change and I feel it was worth the time to learn a complete new way to publish ramseeker.com. You really can’t beat free and fast when it comes to hosting your website that looks great and loads fast on any device</p>

    <h1><a href="/2016/04/19/Apple-MacBook-Air-13-8GB-RAM/">13 inch MacBook Air Now Ships with 8GB of RAM as Default Configuration</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>Apple today quietly bumped the standard configuration of the 13 inch MacBook Air to <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbook-air/specs.html">8GB of RAM</a>. Considering that 8GB of RAM is so cheap (<a href="http://amzn.to/1WcNgUd">about $30.00</a>) this isn’t that big of deal when it comes down to it, but it will give the MacBook Air 13 inch a bit more breathing room for applications that need a bit more RAM or for opening more applications.</p>

<p>Considering that the MacBook Air is one of the current Apple computers you <strong>cannot</strong> upgrade the ram on, this is pretty good news regardless and even though the MacBook Air is due for a refresh (or discontinuation) the 13 inch MacBook Air remains one of the best values for an Apple notebook you can buy today, and this 8GB upgrade only makes the 13 inch MacBook Air a better value than the 11 inch model which still only ships with 4GB of RAM in the standard configuration.</p>

<p>I’m not sure why you would ever want to do this and switching from a Mac to Windows seems like a bad idea all around and considering the price you can get for a Mac that’s just six years old you’re probably better off selling the Mac on your own and using the funds for your new Windows Machine.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2015/10/what-about-the-mac-pro/">What About the Mac Pro?</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>William Gallagher (with Mike Wuerthele) ] <a href="http://www.macnn.com/articles/15/10/14/a.new.potential.mac.pro.chipset.arrived.some.time.ago.so.where.is.it.130846/">posted an article at MacNN</a> on what Apple might plan to do with the Mac Pro:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You look at the profile of the Mac Pro longingly, and you have to wonder whether it’s been forgotten.</p>

  <p>Of course, we thought that back in the beginning of 2013 when this new, cylindrical, tiny Mac Pro was announced. People had given up on ever seeing an update for the aluminum slab-side Mac Pro, they’d given up on Apple, and they felt that Apple had given up on its creative professional users, who were the company’s core audience for many years previously.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don’t think that Apple has forgotten about the Mac Pro, but it’s now a very specialized item that’s aimed at a specific group of users. Also now that the iMacs can be almost and <a href="http://barefeats.com/imac5k10.html">if not as fast</a> as the Mac Pros, I know that if I was in the Market for a new desktop and the speeds are about the same, I would want to buy the iMac because it includes a 5k display where the Mac Pro doesn’t. I think that feature alone would want me to chose the iMac.</p>

<p>The Mac Pro has never seen as regular updates as the other consumer based models and considering a 2013 Mac Pro is still holding it’s own over newer Macs, I don’t see the need for Apple to upgrade this model for some time yet.</p>

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>OWC is the first memory vendor I have found to date to carry the <a href="http://eshop.macsales.com/shop/memory/iMac/Retina-5K2015/DDR3L">1866MHZ ram upgrades you need </a>to max out the RAM on the Late 2015 27 inch iMacs:</p>

<p>Currently, they stock the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>4GB modules</li>
  <li>8gb modules</li>
  <li>16gb modules</li>
</ul>

<p>This means that you have a few choices for upgrade configurations using these 3 different memory upgrade sizes combined with the 4 slots available and if you really need it you can spend <strong>more than $1000</strong> on ram for new 27 inch iMac models. I didn’t think that was possible in this day and age still.</p>

<p>Your options for ram upgrades are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>8GB Memory upgrade kits</li>
  <li>16GB Memory upgrade kits</li>
  <li>32GB memory upgrade kits</li>
  <li>64GB memory upgrade kits</li>
</ul>

<p>Remember these new late 2015 iMacs don’t take the same ram as the older models so the pricing is different for the newer and more expensive RAM. You need 1866MHz PC3-14900 SO-DIMMS for Apple’s latest Macs.</p>

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>I had a hunch I was right yesterday when I researched the new iMacs from Apple for late 2015 – and I wanted to be sure before I posted otherwise, but the way I read the specs on Apple’s <a href="http://www.apple.com/imac/specs/">technical specs page for the iMacs</a> was that <strong>only the 27 inch iMac</strong> was upgradable and site sponsor OWC confirms this with a <a href="http://blog.macsales.com/33640-owc-tears-down-21-5-inch-imac-retina-4k-confirms-memory-is-soldered">teardown of the Apple’s 21 inch model</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Memory is soldered in. OWC recommends buying as much memory as you can at the time of purchase to increase the longevity and usefulness of your iMac.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This means that like OWC suggests that if you’re going to want to max out the ram on the 21.5 inch iMacs to full capacity you have to do so at time of purchase.</p>

<p>Also, check out the gallery at the link above as they have some <strong>great tear down and unboxing photos</strong> of the 21.5 inch retina iMac (Late 2015)</p>

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>Now that the ram prices are starting to come online for the new 27 inch Apple iMacs (Late 2015), <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/late-2015-27-inch-apple-imac-memory-upgrade-prices/">I’ve started to track the prices,</a> and unless you’re willing to cough up over $1000 for the 64GB upgrade option (double the recommended by Apple) most other sizes are perfectly affordable.</p>

<p>Perhaps not as cheap as the DDR3 1600MHz ram prices you see above but considering this is newer and faster ram for the faster iMacs with retina displays you can still max out these iMac models with 32GB of RAM for under $300.00</p>

<p>So far, I’ve found some pricing from <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/2015/10/data-memory-system-memory-upgrades-for-apple-27-inch-imac-late-2015/">Data Memory Systems</a> and <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/2015/10/owc-now-carries-memory-for-late-2015-27-inch-retina-display-imacs/">OWC</a> and Amazon but more vendors will show up next week or so and I will continue to built out the price list as the ram upgrades become available.</p>

<p>Also, remember you can only upgrade the ram on the Late 2015 27 inch iMacs . If you’re looking for ram upgrades for the 21.5 inch retina display iMac, <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/2015/10/owc-confirms-new-21-5-inch-late-2015-retina-imacs-cant-accept-user-installed-ram-upgrades/">you’re out of luck</a>.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2015/10/ram-upgrades-for-the-late-2015-apple-imac/">RAM Upgrades for the Late 2015 Apple iMac</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>Apple’s released new iMac Models today in both 21.5 inch and 27 inch displays. Their tech specs state that these new iMacs take faster 1867MHz ram vs the slower 1600MHz ram that’s been in close to every mac for the past few years.</p>

<p>I have yet to find a memory vendor that <strong>actually sells</strong> 1867MHz ram for the new iMacs (except for <a href="http://amzn.to/1Nb8MmO">Amazon</a>) but as in the past when the new Apple computers ship the memory vendors eventually carry the new ram upgrades for the new models and I will update ramseeker when the time comes.</p>

<p>Of course, if you really need a Maxed out late 2015 iMac today then the only other option will be to buy it direct from Apple, but the memory direct from Apple isn’t all that cheap:</p>

<p>The cost to upgrade from the stock 8GB to 16GB is a $200 price bump, and if you want to max out your brand new iMac it will cost you $400 for 32GB of RAM from Apple compared to what looks to be about $100/16GB if the pricing I found at Amazon are any indication.</p>

<p>For more info on the new Apple iMacs:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/imac/">Apple</a>, of course but also <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/2991920/hardware/imac-with-4k-retina-display-review-a-high-resolution-desktop-mac-for-the-masses.html">Jason Snell has a review</a> of the new iMacs over at Macworld.</p>

<p>I will keep you updated when the other vendors come on board with more ram upgrade options for the new late 2015 iMac models with retina displays.</p>

<p>update: a few vendors have memory upgrades now in stock and I have started to track pricing <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/2015/10/27-inch-apple-imac-late-2015-ddr3-1866mhz-memory-upgrade-prices/">here</a></p>

<p>With the release of Apple’s new iPad Pro he might be on to something.

Marshmallow is also prepared for the future with support for USB Type-C’s power delivery spec, a Fingerprint authentication API, and 4K display support. And, as with any Android release, there’s also lots of new Googley stuff—a slick new search interface and a contextual search mode called “Google Now on Tap,” for example.</p>

		<div class="post-content"><p>Everymac.com has compiled a great article on the <a href="http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/iphone/iphone-faq/differences-between-iphone-6s-iphone-6s-plus-models.html">differences between the two latest Apple iPhones for 2015:</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It would be easy to take a look at the larger iPhone 6s Plus and smaller iPhone 6s side-by-side and conclude that size is the differentiating factor. Although there is some truth to this general observation, there are other important differences that are not so obvious.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you’re looking to compare the two models this site looks at the differences between camera, battery life, screens and even identification differences so you can tell the 2 apart this is the resource you need.</p>

  <p>The Chromecast Audio is an interesting product, but after I spent about an hour or so playing around with it, I realized that I don’t really have much of a need for it. But that doesn’t mean it’s a bad product, necessarily, just that my setup doesn’t really lend itself to this device.</p>

		<div class="post-content"><p>Dan Knight at Low End Mac has <a href="http://lowendmac.com/2015/the-rise-and-fall-of-mac-os-x-versions-2009-to-2015/">quite the interesting chart</a> with six years of data of the Mac OS versions that are used when visiting his site from 2009 to 2015:</p>

  <p>Over time, the distribution of Mac OS versions among Mac users changes as new versions of the OS are released, old Macs are retired, and new models arrive that only support the most recent version. Today we’re looking at six years worth of data.</p>

<p>I bet this took a fair bit of time to gather all the data and chart it all out.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2015/06/how-much-does-it-cost-to-finance-a-mac/">How Much Does it Cost to Finance a Mac?</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>One way to buy a new Apple computer is to finance it and pay for it over time. If you’re a business you can usually write off the payment as an expense (see your accountant) or if your Apple computer is for personal use, financing your Mac makes the cost <strong>more</strong> affordable because you can pay for it over time.</p>

<p>Here’s a few ways you can make monthly payments on your Mac:</p>

<h2 id="apple-financing">Apple Financing</h2>

<p>The easiest way to buy an Apple computer is to buy it directly from Apple and then make the monthly payments through the <a href="http://store.apple.com/us/payment_plan">Apple Payment Plan</a> that offers two ways you can pay for your new mac:</p>

<h3 id="paypal-credit-monthly-payment-plan">Paypal Credit Monthly Payment Plan</h3>

<p>The PayPal credit monthly payment plan offers regular monthly payments, a 12.99% APR, and the option to select 6,12,18 or 24 month terms. This is the plan you see at the Apple Store for payments based on 24 months:</p>

<h3 id="barclay-visa-financing">Barclay Visa Financing</h3>

<p>Using the Barclay Visa Card you can get financing on your new Mac for up to 18 months and get no interest if you pay it off in full during the promo period. You get six months to pay for purchases under $498.00, 12 months for under $998 and 18 months for any purchase $999 or over (not hard to do if you’re buying any mac other than the Mac Mini)</p>

<p>Which one is better? If you know you can pay off the Mac <strong>before</strong> the promo period is over then the Barclay Visa plan is the way to go because you <strong>pay no interest</strong> on you purchase.</p>

<p>But if you just want a fixed payment plan over the course of 24 months with the smallest and cheapest monthly payment then the Payal plan is the way to go.</p>

<h2 id="ebay-financing">eBay Financing</h2>

<p>eBay of course uses <a href="https://www.paypalcredit.com/index.html">Paypal Credit</a> for their financing and offers the option to make no payments for 6 months. You will still get monthly invoices and you can still make payments at any time to pay it off early too. If you know you can pay off your Mac in six months or less then Paypal Credit is the way to go when shopping for a Mac on eBay.</p>

<h2 id="mac-mall-financing">Mac Mall Financing</h2>

<p>MacMall also uses Paypal Credit for financing so all the terms that apply to eBay are the same that are used when you buy a Mac from Mac Mall.</p>

<h2 id="amazon-financing">Amazon Financing</h2>

<p>Amazon offers two types of financing. The first is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/iss/credit/storecardmember/ref=footer_plcc?_encoding=UTF8&amp;plattr=PLCCFOOT">Amazon Store Card</a> that offers promotional financing with 6, 12 or 24 month terms.</p>

<p>The Amazon Rewards Visa is the card that Amazon promotes the most and offers $50.00 off instantly on any purchase and you also get 3% back when you buy from Amazon. If you’re buying a $30.00 Apple computer then that’s not too bad a deal.</p>

<h2 id="best-buy-financing">Best Buy Financing</h2>

<p>Best Buy Credit offers financing for 12 months on purchases $399.99 and up and they offer a 12 month no interest rate if you pay off your Mac in 12 month or less</p>

<h2 id="what-is-the-best-way-to-finance-an-apple-computer">What is the Best Way to Finance an Apple Computer?</h2>

<p>Of course, this depends on what you are comfortable with and where you buy your Mac.</p>

<h4 id="apple">Apple</h4>

<p>The Apple Store offers the fixed finance rates over time so you will know you’re paying interest but you will also know what the payment will be and most payments will be about $50.00 or so a month for popular devices like the MacBook Air or MacBook Pro.</p>

<p>If you know you can pay off the Mac in 18 months or less and don’t want to pay interest then buying your Mac from Apple through the Barclay Visa plan is a good idea too.</p>

<h4 id="ebay">eBay</h4>

<p>Deals on Mac computers can be sometimes be had on eBay especially when it comes to older stock or refurbished items. If you can pay it off in six months using the PayPal credit plan then this is another option.</p>

<h4 id="amazon">Amazon</h4>

<p>Amazon offers that 3% discount but you will pay interest from day one. Unless you find a great deal on a Mac I would buy from somewhere else that charges no interest</p>

<h4 id="best-buy">Best Buy</h4>

<p>Buying a Mac at Best Buy can be a pretty good deal. It’s quite common for Best buy to have sales on new Macs that beat any price you can get a Mac from Apple or Amazon. It’s not uncommon to see a $100 discount on new Apple computers. And if you can pay off the full purchase price in 12 months then using the Best Buy credit card isn’t that bad of an idea.</p>

<p>Personally, if I was going to finance a Mac I would just do so from the Apple Store directly and make the monthly payments via PayPal credit over the term I selected. A new Apple computer will still be fully usable in 2 years and even though you do pay some interest over the term I think it’s worth it to know exactly what your payments will be.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2015/06/what-is-the-best-macbook-for-2015/">What is the Best MacBook for 2015?</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>With the release of the retina MacBook in March 2015 as Apple’s lightest and thinnest Mac to date there are now three different notebook computers to choose from and the choices are not easy and there are pros and cons to each model but first, let’s look at what’s available</p>

<p>1.6GHz Intel Core i5 processor with turbo boost to 2.7GHz and 4GB of RAM with a 256GB SSD drive.</p>

<h2 id="what-macbook-to-choose">What MacBook To Choose?</h2>

<p>I count 12 different Apple notebooks to choose from, and that’s not including if you buy from the Apple Store and start to customize your order where there’s even more options. But for the case of this article I want to compare the stock models because there’s a good chance this is what you would buy off the shelf.</p>

<h3 id="inch-macbook-vs-11-inch-macbook-air">12 inch MacBook vs 11 inch MacBook Air</h3>

<p>The retina MacBook is Apple’s latest model and as such is also the thinnest Apple notebook you an buy today but it offers some disadvantages over the other models and the very first is the lack of ports as there are just two for this model: one USB-C port and one 1/8 inch headphone jack.</p>

<p>If you want to add any more ports you will have to buy expensive dongles which in my mind kind of negates the whole light and thin thing if you still have to carry around dongles to make it work with external peripherals.</p>

<p>But the pros of the MacBook are light weight, a beautiful 12 inch retina display and all day battery life of up to 9 hours mean you might not have to charge this thing over the course of the day.</p>

<p>The 11 inch Macbook Air on the other hand offers some pretty good arguments to choose this over the retina Macbook and that’s ports. Unlike the rMB, the 11 inch MBA offers the usual selection of ports like USB 3.0 ports and a thunderbolt port. The only missing port from the 11 inch model is the fact that it does not have a SDHC card reader for transferring photos from your camera to your Apple Macbook Air.</p>

<p>The display is also less sharp than the MacBook and for some this is a deal breaker because except for the 13 inch MacBook Pro with the spinning hard drive, the MacBook Air models are the only models to have TN panels for display which offer less sharpness, contrast and viewing angles.</p>

<p>This isn’t to say the Macbook Air 11 inch is bad, but the display is not as nice as computers with retina displays.</p>

<p>Battery life is claimed to be up to 9 hours so the difference in Battery life between the two are the same.</p>

<p>Lastly, I want to mention the difference in price. The Macbook Air in 11 inch form is considerably cheaper than than the new MacBook with a savings of over $400 you have to ask yourself if the bigger and better screen is worth the $400. If you keep and use your notebook a lot the answer might be yes because if you keep the Mac for 2 years the retina display costs $20.00 a less than $20.00 a month more over that time.</p>

<h3 id="inch-macbook-vs-13-inch-macbook-air">12 inch MacBook vs 13 inch MacBook Air</h3>

<p>This is even a harder decision to make because when you compare the two there’s even less difference in price and that makes your buying choice even harder.</p>

<p>Like the 11 inch model, many of the comparisons are the same but I won’t repeat myself here. The 13 inch model of course has a bigger display than the 11 inch model but the display is the same technology but there is a SDHC card on the 13 inch model where the 11 inch omits this feature.</p>

<h2 id="inch-macbook-vs-13-inch-macbook-pro-retina-display">12 inch MacBook vs 13 inch MacBook Pro Retina Display</h2>

<p>It gets even harder to choose from these two models because the price is the same, but that’s the one of the only features that the MacBook and 13 inch MacBook Pro have in common. Both also feature a retina display but that’s where the similarities end.</p>

<p>The MacBook is lighter and offers less ports and less power but it is designed more for travel compared to the 3.5lb MacBook Pro that offers a full compliment of ports as well as the slightly bigger display and can do double duty as both a desktop replacement as well as a portable computer.</p>

<p>But, if you’re like me and spend most of your time in a word processor then the power of the MacBook would be fine for most users. It’s a very hard choice to make: lighter and smaller vs bigger and more power?</p>

<h3 id="inch-macbook-vs-15-inch-macbook-pro">12 inch MacBook vs 15 inch MacBook Pro</h3>

<p>You really shouldn’t even compare these two models because they are different ends of the spectrum when it comes to size and performance. The 15 inch is definitely designed to be the most powerful notebook you can buy where the MacBook is the lightest and smallest. If you know you need power and want your Apple laptop to be the fastest notebook you can buy from Apple then obviously the 15 inch should be your choice.</p>

<h3 id="inch-macbook-air-vs-13-inch-macbook-pro-retina">13 inch MacBook Air vs 13 inch MacBook Pro Retina</h3>

<p>I will make this easy for you. If you need to buy the cheapest 13 inch MacBook Apple makes then buy the Air. Also you must consider the RAM and storage options between the two. The Air comes with half the RAM and storage as the MacBook Pro, forgetting about processor speed and display and yet there’s only a $300 difference between the two and if you build your 13 inch Air to have 8GB of RAM vs 4 then the cost is even with both machines costing exactly the same for 8/256GB configurations.</p>

<p>This makes it easy to decide in my opinion. Unless you really need the lighter weight of the Macbook Air then get the MacBook Pro because you get more speed and better display and the weight difference between the two is only about half a pound and oddly enough the MacBook Pro actually has a smaller footprint than the MacBook Air</p>

<h3 id="inch-macbook-air-vs-13-inch-macbook-air">11 inch MacBook Air vs 13 inch MacBook Air</h3>

<p>I think the big difference between the two of these models is price, weight and physical size. Except for the lack of a SDHC Card there’s not a lot of difference between the two. If I were to buy the MacBook Air it would be the 11 inch for the small size and cheap price. It’s not too hard to find a price of closer to $800 for the 2015 11 inch MacBook Air and that’s considerably less than the 13 inch versions available to buy.</p>

<h3 id="inch-macbook-pro-vs-15-inch-macbook-pro">13 inch MacBook Pro vs 15 inch MacBook Pro</h3>

<p>Here’s another choice that I think is pretty easy to make. If you need the fastest notebook you can buy and can stomach the $2000 or more price then the 15 inch is the model to buy. But if you just need fast enough processing in a pro level notebook from Apple, then the 13 inch MacBook Pro is the way to go because it’s over $700 cheaper when you compare the two models. Heck, you could almost buy a 13 inch MacBook Pro <strong>and</strong> an 11 inch MacBook Air for the same money as a 15 inch MacBook Pro.</p>

<h3 id="what-apple-notebook-should-you-buy">What Apple Notebook Should You Buy?</h3>

<p>As you can see above, that’s a pretty complicated question but if you can handle the weight I think the <strong>13 inch retina Macbook Pro is the Mac I would buy.</strong> I don’t need the maximum in portability as I work from home so I can live with the half pound more in weight. But if I am going to spend over a $1000 on a brand new Apple computer I want to make sure I get the Maximum vale and for me it’s the 13 inch rMBP.</p>

<p>The MacBook Air is starting to age, and so am I so I would appreciate the sharper display. I don’t really need the extra speed but I guess it would be nice to have in the odd chance I do some photo editing here and there.</p>

<p>The retina 12 inch Macbook looks interesting yet I don’t know I could get used to the keyboard and I don’t really need the light weight or the reduction in ports.</p>

<p>The 15 inch is just a crazy buy both in price and size and weight as well as speed so this really isn’t even a consideration for me at this time.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2015/06/what-are-the-differences-between-the-2015-macbook-vs-the-2015-macbook-air/">What are the Differences Between the 2015 MacBook vs the 2015 MacBook Air?</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><h2 id="age">Age</h2>

<p>Even though the MacBook Air release date and the MacBook Air refresh date are the same day, the MacBook Air models have been around for some time in earlier configurations</p>

<h2 id="configurations">Configurations</h2>

<h3 id="apple-macbook-configuration">2015 Apple Macbook Configuration</h3>

<p>The Apple MacBook is available in two versions and comes in 1.1Ghz and 1.2Ghz models.</p>

<p>The 1.1Ghz model ships standard with 8GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage with Turbo boost to 2.4Ghz</p>

<p>The 1.2 Ghz ships with the same amount of RAM but comes with a 512GB flash storage for more space for your files and applications.</p>

<p>The price difference between the two retina MacBook models is $300: $1299 for the base configuration or $1599 for the mode of MacBooks</p>

<h3 id="apple-11-inch-macbook-air-configurations">2015 Apple 11 inch MacBook Air Configurations</h3>

<p>When it comes to the MacBook Air there’s two configurations to choose from:</p>

<p>The $899 MacBook Air gets you a 1.6GHz processor with Turbo boost up to 2.7Ghz and 4GB of RAM with 128GB SSD flash storage come standard.</p>

<p>The $1099 11 inch MacBook Air gets you the same processor and RAM but a bigger 25GB SSD drive vs the 128GB capacity in the base configuration.</p>

<h2 id="ports">Ports</h2>

<p>The MaBook comes with just two ports: a USB-C port and a 1/8 headphone port.</p>

<p>The MacBook Air ships with many more ports and may be the deciding factor if you need to connect a lot of peripherals to your Mac. The Air offers 2 USB 3.0 ports, a thunderbolt port, a magsafe power port and a 1/8 headphone jack.</p>

<p>The 11 inch model offers minimal ports too compared to the 13 inch Apple notebooks but it still offer many more ports than the 12 inch MacBook does.</p>

<h2 id="display">Display</h2>

<p>The better display is on the 12 inch MacBook as the display on the rMB is a 2304-by-1440 IPS display with 226 pixels per inch and is a 16:10 ratio.</p>

<p>The 11 inch MacBook Air is the older TN panel display that’s pretty old and has been standard fare on the Apple portables for some time until the release of retina displays for the MacBook Pro models were released.</p>

<p>The 11 inch MacBook Air offers a 16:9 display ratio for a 1366 x 768px resolution as the native option</p>

<h2 id="processor">Processor</h2>

<p>I have already mentioned the speeds of the different models but the MacBook Air is actually the faster of the two models for more CPU intensive stuff but if you need the light weight of the MacBook then you might be okay with the slower MacBook.</p>

<h2 id="weight">Weight</h2>

<p>The 12 inch MacBook wins here but not by all that much:</p>

<p>The MacBook Air weighs 2.38lbs while the Macbook comes in at just over 2lbs at 2.03lbs.</p>

<p>Personally, I bet there’s very little difference in weight for everyday travel. I guess if you absolutely need the lightest notebook possible the MacBook wins, but I wouldn’t really let about a 1/4 lb be the deciding factor</p>

<h2 id="color">Color</h2>

<p>Here’s another thing I wouldn’t care for but some might. The MaBook is available in three colors: Gold, Space Grey and Silver whereas the MacBook Air is still silver, same as it always was.</p>

<h2 id="keyboard-and-trackpad">Keyboard and Trackpad</h2>

<p>The keyboard and trackpad technology is completely different between the two models. The MacBook offers a newly designed ‘butterfly’ keyboard design with a shallower travel vs the standard scissor design of the MacBook Air.</p>

<p>The trackpad is also all new on the MacBook with a <strong>force touch</strong> keyboard standard on Apple’s latest technology, while the MacBook Air still offers the standard multi-gesture glass trackpad we have all come to love</p>

<h2 id="battery-life">Battery Life</h2>

<p>Apple claims that the Battery on the MacBook lasts up to 10 hours and the MacBook Air offers 9 hours. Of course, both of these estimates are under the best operating conditions so your mileage will vary but I don’t see battery life being a real big problem for both computers as they both offer close to entire day of battery life.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>It’s a hard decision to choose between the 12 inch MacBook vs the 11 inch MacBook Air. The MacBook offers weight and battery life advantages along with some new hardware tech, while the 11 inch MacBook air for 2005 is really just a refresh of the same old design.</p>

<p>The display might be the big difference between the two that decides what MacBook to buy but personally, and for my needs – writing and very light image editing I think if I were to buy a new Apple notebook today I would buy the 11 inch MacBook Air.</p>

<p>Also, I don’t think the display on the 11 inch MacBook Air is all that bad either.</p>

<p>The MacBook looks like fun but at $1300 for the base model and the lack of ports that force you to buy adapters to connect peripherals make me want to hold off on this model until I see MacBook 2.0 in 2016.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2015/06/what-apple-computer-models-are-compatible-with-os-x-10-11-el-capitan/">What Apple Computer Models are Compatible with OS X 10.11 El Capitan?</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>When Apple releases  a new software upgrade like they have with OS X 10.11 El Capitan one of the first questions that comes to mind is: <strong>Is my Mac Compatible? </strong></p>

<p>Apple hasn’t specifically released compatibility charts with the El Capitan release because at this point it’s just beta software so changes could be made but for now it looks like the ansers is that  if your Mac can run <a href="http://www.apple.com/osx/">Yosemite</a> , then there’s a really good chance you can run the newer beta operating system too, and currently that means that  the following computers will work with OSX 10.11 according to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/mac/releasenotes/General/rn-osx-10.11/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40016209">this page</a>&lt;section class="section"&gt;</p>

<p class="para">
  The OS X v10.11 Developer Beta supports the following Macs:
</p>

<ul class="list-bullet">
  <li class="item">
    <p class="para">
      iMac (Mid 2007 or newer)
    </p>
  </li>
  
  <li class="item">
    <p class="para">
      MacBook Air (Late 2008 or newer)
    </p>
  </li>
  
  <li class="item">
    <p class="para">
      MacBook (Late 2008 Aluminum, or Early 2009 or newer)
    </p>
  </li>
  
  <li class="item">
    <p class="para">
      Mac mini (Early 2009 or newer)
    </p>
  </li>
  
  <li class="item">
    <p class="para">
      MacBook Pro (Mid/Late 2007 or newer)
    </p>
  </li>
  
  <li class="item">
    <p class="para">
      Mac Pro (Early 2008 or newer)
    </p>
  </li>
  
  <li class="item">
    <p class="para">
      Xserve (Early 2009)
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This is good news indeed for those of us that have older Macs and want to keep them running for as long as possible.&lt;/section&gt;</p>

<p>Granted, not ALL features will work on the older Macs: For example features like continuity and handoff might not be compatible with your hardware. But, if you’re like me and have an older Mac and  don’t really need <strong>all the features  of the Mac OS </strong>but you still want to try the new beta Mac OS X when it’s released in July then this is pretty great news. I thought for sure my 2008 Aluminum MacBook would be put out to pasture as it would not  be compatible with this latest release but it looks like I can still use my older Mac  with the Latest Mac OS which is pretty amazing for a 7 year old computer to be able to do.</p>

<p>I’m looking forward to giving the new beta a try when it’s released later in July 2015.</p>

<p>Personally I think the six plus might be a bit too big for my liking but it’s a good perspective on using the bigger phone.</p>

<p>I have been thing of switching back to iOS after a play wih Android and one of my biggest fears is battery life. My LG G3 has all day battery life with ease. It it looks like the bigger iPhone might be up to the task as well.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2015/04/april-1-2015/">April 1, 2015</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>I have long been curating ram prices online and now it’s time for a new approach. I have tried different approaches as the demand for ram prices have declined now that Apple and a lot of other manufacturers don’t allow for ram upgrades to be done by the end user but nothing has really resonated with me to date.</p>

<p>I had thought about just writing articles about Apple and the like, but I am no news site nor do I have the time or interest to grab all the news. Also, my interests are widespread and not just Apple. I am interested in books, photography and other subjects just like you are, and over the course of the day I tend to visit these sites related to these topics and some times they have good stuff that at very least is worth a look and this is where I plan to do this from now on, and link out as much as I can</p>

<p>If you’re interested in just Apple news curated there a a lot of sites that do it better than I ever could like <a href="http://www.macintouch.com">Macintouch</a>, <a href="http://www.macsurfer.com">Macsurfer</a> for news and <a href="http://www.macprices.net">MacPrices</a> and <a href="http://www.dealnews.com">DealMac</a> for deals on Apple stuff and more but I need to have a place to share the stuff I find online in addition to just tracking ram prices and I figure that April Fool’s day is the perfect time to start such an adventure.</p>

<p>From time to time I may write an article or two when I have a thought or idea that I want to expand on further, but I will stick to what I do best – and that’s curate the stuff that interests me – just like ram and memory prices did so many years ago when I first started this site. And speaking of ram prices, I <strong>will still track them</strong> and you can find the perfect ram for your Mac from the menus on the top of the page just like always. Whether you’re looking to upgrade the ram on a ten year old iBook or the latest iMac (one of the few Apple computers you can still add ram upgrades to) there will still be a memory upgrade price chart for you to check. RAM price updates are not going anywhere.</p>

    The Apple iPhone 4s is the better phone and is still priced at about $200 for a refurbished model
  </p>
</div>

<p>The Apple iPhone 4 and 4s models are pretty old now in 2014 but that doesn’t mean that they are two old for use or that they won’t make a good secondary phone or if you don’t need to have the fastest iPhone out there you can get some pretty good deals on older Apple iPhone 4 and iPhone 4S models.</p>

<h2 id="do-you-need-ios-8">Do you need iOS 8?</h2>

<p>The big difference between the two phones, and the first I want to mention is support for iOS 8. If you’re on the fence between the two models is that the 4 taps out at iOS 7 but the 4s can run iOS 8. There have been a lot of improvements to iOS 8 from iOS 7 but if you’re a casual user of your iPhone the 4s still runs the latest OS and can be bought for under $200.00.</p>

</div>

<h2 id="how-much-do-you-want-to-spend-on-an-apple-iphone">How Much Do You Want To Spend on an Apple iPhone?</h2>

<p>The Apple iPhone 4 will be the cheaper option and because this phone does not run the latest operating system there’s less demand for these phones, yet they’re still perfectly fine for some and the best part is they can be bought for under $100.00</p>

<p> </p>

<div id="asa-42a76b9a3a38eb8015e48819779a2503" class="asa_async_container asa_async_container_default">
</div>

<h2 id="what-iphone-features-do-you-need">What iPhone Features Do You Need?</h2>

<p>The big difference between the two iPhone models are besides the operating system is speed. The Apple iPhone 4s features an A5 Apple processor while the Apple iPhone offers an A4 processor that’s half as fast as the newer iPhone.</p>

<p>Do you need the speed? If you’re looking to run iOS 8 vs iOS 7 then the answer is yes. If you’re okay with saving money on an older iPhone and can live with iOS 7 then the slower iPhone might not feel all that slower in real life.</p>

<h2 id="hello-siri">Hello, Siri?</h2>

<p>The iPhone 4s supports Siri while the iPhone 4 doesn’t.</p>

<p>These 3 features are the three main items that differentiate the two models.</p>

<p>If you’re looking to buy a budget or refurbished phone, the Apple iPhone 4s is the phone I suggest you buy. The older iPhone 4 does not offer the speed to run the latest OS and the other features and would be my biggest disappointment. Add to the fact, the older iPhone 4 is much slower and the iPhone 4 does not look like a bargain.</p>

<p>Rerfurbished Apple iPhone 4s models can be bought for under $200 in most cases – a fraction of what it would cost to buy an iPhone 6, and yet both of these phones pretty can run the same OS and offer the same user experience for the most part.</p>

    The 2014 Mac Mini can&#8217;t take a RAM Upgrade so be sure to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00746XJLK/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=390957&#038;creativeASIN=B00746XJLK&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;tag=ramseeker-20&#038;linkId=OSC3RLAR5UQ3O5N6">buy the Mac Mini </a>with the Maximum RAM.
  </p>
</div>

<p>The short answer? None.</p>

<p>Much to the dismay of many the 2014 Mac Mini <strong>cannot accept any upgrades</strong> from the user. The only way to max out the RAM on the Mac Mini is to buy a Mac Mini with more ram at time of purchase. This is a shame, because now instead of being able to extend or improve the performance of your 2014 Mac Mini you’re out of luck and over time the amount of RAM you have in this model may affect how long you end up keeping the Mac Mini over time.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="mac-mini-configurations-2014-mac-mini-configurations">2014 Mac Mini Configurations {#2014-mac-mini-configurations}</h2>

<div id="asa-82259ab4ad9b62e011423f15c5787b2e" class="asa_async_container asa_async_container_default">
</div>

<p>There are a few configurations of Mac Mini you can buy with different amounts of bot RAM and storage, with the maximum ram for the 2014 models capping out at 16GB for all models. Essentially the starting point for ram in the latest Mac Minis are either 4GB or 8GB with the option to add more RAM up to the 16GB Maximum</p>

<h2 id="the-cost-of-a-2014-mac-mini-ram-upgrade">The Cost of a 2014 Mac Mini RAM Upgrade</h2>

<p>The cheapest Mac Mini ships with just 4GB of RAM as standard with 8GB and 16GB uprade options priced at 200 increments. Adding 8GB of RAM to this model will cost 300 making this desktop anything but cheap. If you add the maximum ram to this model you are looking at a 60 percent price increase <strong>just for the ram upgrade</strong> alone.</p>

<p>Compare a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008LTBJFW/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B008LTBJFW&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkId=VOZI6CXS4UHC6YVB">16GB ram upgrade</a> for the last and now discontinued 2012 Mac Mini and you’re looking at a premium of $200 over what you would pay if you could upgrade the ram yourself.</p>

<h2 id="faster-mac-mini-ram-upgrades">Faster Mac Mini RAM Upgrades</h2>

<p>Adding more ram to the faster 2.6Ghz and 2.8GHz gets a bit better because these models ship with 8GB of ram as standard equipment out of the box, and adding or doubling the memory to 16GB only adds 200 price upgrade vs the $300 Apple charges to add more RAM to the Cheaper Mac Mini.</p>

<h2 id="is-a-2014-mac-mini-upgrade-worth-it">Is a 2014 Mac Mini Upgrade Worth It?</h2>

<p>That’s a good question. The 2014 models are the latest and theoretically the fastest Mac Minis you can buy but the price of RAM can be 3x or more the cost, and when you consider the price of the RAM upgrade you have to compare prices of all the Mac Minis to see what the best price point for you might be.</p>

<p>The cost to max out the 1.4GHz costs 799 from 200 for the same upgrade and results in a price bump from 899.00, and the price for the 2.8GHz models jump from 1199.00.</p>

<h2 id="whats-the-best-deal-for-a-2014-mac-mini">What’s the best deal for a 2014 Mac Mini?</h2>

<p>Based on the pricing above I would say the 2.6GHz model with 16GB of RAM is the best value for a Mac Mini in 2015, as it’s only $100 more than the cheaper model yet offers a much faster processor of 2.6Ghz vs the 1.4Ghz on the model that costs less.</p>

<h2 id="should-you-buy-the-mac-mini-with-the-maximum-ram">Should You Buy the Mac Mini with the Maximum RAM?</h2>

<p>Only if you think you need it. In my personal case, I could do with the bare minimum of 4GB the $500 Mac Mini as I basically live in a text editor, and <a href="https://www.apple.com/osx/how-to-upgrade/">according to Apple</a> it only takes 2GB of RAM to run the Yosemite OS so I should be okay with the 4GB of ram limit, and don’t think it would be worth it to buy the 8GB ram version. But if you do any photo editing or work with video then you’re better off with the 2.6 or 2.8Ghz versions maxed out to 8GB of RAM.</p>

<p>To Summarize, the Mac Mini is a good cheap computer from Apple, but if you need more RAM you’re looking at spending at least 100 and current street prices are about $80.00 for ram from reputable vendors so the twenty dollar premium to go from 4GB to 8GB is a good idea, but when it comes to adding 16GB of RAM on the 2014 models, it gets a little pricey.</p>

    If you want to upgrade a 2014 Mac Mini, you&#8217;re out of luck. But older models can accept both hard drive and ram upgades and are a great way to add more life to your older Mac Mini
  </p>
</div>

<p>Updating a Mac Mini is a great way to get more life or faster speed or more storage out of your Mac Mini and here’s a few suggestions to enhance your computing experience when using the Apple Mac Mini:</p>

<h2 id="mac-mini">2014 Mac Mini</h2>

<p>With the 2014 Mac Mini, you’re pretty much screwed when it comes to upgrades – at least internally. If you want to upgrade the ram or storage space on a 2014 Mac Mini be sure to do it at the time you order your Mac Mini or you will be stuck with the configuration for the entire time you own the 2014 model.</p>

<p>You can upgrade the Mac Mini externally by adding an external SSD like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00RWXV8FE/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00RWXV8FE&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkId=3ADL2BHFTNRF5A6A">Samsung T1 External SSD</a> which will allow you to add more storage via the Mac Mini’s USB port. These are currently available in 250GB, 500GB and 1TB sizes and are a cheap way to get more storage space on your Mac.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="mac-mini-1">2012 Mac Mini</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/ddr3-1600mhz-memory-upgrade-prices-apple-macbook-pro-mac-mini-imac/">check ram prices</a></p>

<p>The 2012 Mac Mini has been one of the most popular Mac Mini models due to the fact that it’s the last upgradable Mac Mini Apple has made so you’re able to upgrade the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/2014/10/mac-mini-memory-upgrade-prices/">Mac Mini RAM</a> and the hard drive on the Mac Mini to a maximum of 16GB for the RAM and whatever size you want for the solid state storage.</p>

<p>If you’re looking to swap out the hard drive of the Mac Mini for faster SSD storage, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00OAJ412U/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00OAJ412U&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkId=7TMIOSOINWMBU2VZ%5C">Samsung 850 Evo SSD</a> models are a good choice and start at under $100.00 for 128GB and go up from there. If you want to max out the SSD storage on your Mac Mini to 1TB you should expect to pay about $400 or so.</p>

<p>And if you don’t need the fast storage space of a solid state drive for your Mac Mini then you can add more space via a traditional hard drive. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0088PUEPK/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0088PUEPK&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkId=GYOEDEVP7PO26IPK">Western Digital Blue</a> line of hard drives is an excellent choice and a 1TB drive can be had for under $50 at times.</p>

<h2 id="mac-mini-2">2011 Mac Mini</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/ddr3-1333mhz-apple-macbook-pro-mac-mini-imac-memory-upgrade-prices/">check ram prices</a></p>

<p>The 2011 Mac Mini can be upgraded exactly the same as the 2012 mode with a few caveats: The memory you need to buy for the 201 model differs from later models and requires the use of DDR <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006ON5KZC/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B006ON5KZC&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkId=K4UG3SBT6XE5KPRQ">1333Mhz sodimms</a> vs the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008LTBJFW/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B008LTBJFW&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkId=QGYKVBEISZULRSEN">1600MHz sodimms</a> of the 2012 models.</p>

<p>Technically, Apple suggests just 8GB of RAM for the Mac Mini for this model year but you can squeeze 16GB into these models as well.</p>

<p>When it comes to hard drive upgrades on the Mac Mini for 2011, see my suggestions for the 2012 models as they apply here as well for the 2011 versions.</p>

<h2 id="mac-mini-3">2010 Mac Mini</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/2014/10/mac-mini-memory-upgrade-prices/#ddr3-1066-memory-upgrade-prices">check ram prices</a></p>

<p>The 2010 Mac Minis max out at 8GB of RAM vs the 16GB max for later models an use slower 1066Mhz speed. The good news is even though you can only max out the memory on the 2010 models, you can get the 8GB upgrade for well under $100 and is a pretty cheap upgrade for your older aging Mac Mini that is now five years old.</p>

<h2 id="mac-mini-4">2009 Mac Mini</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/2014/10/mac-mini-memory-upgrade-prices/#ddr3-1066-memory-upgrade-prices">check ram prices</a></p>

<p>The fact that these Mac Minis can run the <a href="https://www.apple.com/osx/">latest version of the Mac OS</a> operating system is one reason to squeeze more life out of these six year old computers from Apple. You will need to buy 8GB of 1066 DDR3 ram for the 2009 models.<br />
Adding an internal hard drive is a bit trickier than the earlier models <a href="http://eshop.macsales.com/installvideos/mac_mini_2009/">but it can be done.</a></p>

<h2 id="mac-mini-5">2007 Mac Mini</h2>

<p>The 2007 Mac Minis are definitely starting to show their age, but can still take more ram. – up to 4GB, even though the official suggestion by Apple is just 2GB. 4GB of ram is crazy cheap for these and you may want to consider <a href="http://www.ebay.com">buying used ram</a> for these older models because you might even get it cheaper.</p>

<p>Be sure to buy DDR2 667Mhz sodimms for all 2007 Mac Mini models.</p>

<p>Hard Drive Upgrades are the same as the 2009 models.</p>

<h2 id="mac-mini-6">2006 Mac Mini</h2>

<p>You can squeeze 4GB of ram into a 2006 Mac Mini, which is kind of amazing considering that this computer is now closing in on a decade when it comes to age. You will need to buy DDR2 667Mhz memory for this model too – essentially all that the 2007 models require can be used here too.</p>

<h2 id="mac-mini-7">2005 Mac Mini</h2>

<p>(see upgrades for all 2006 Models)</p>

<p>With the 2005 Mac Mini models you’re now looking to add an upgrade to a ten year old computer and I might suggest that you add a new computer to use vs an upgrade. But, if you’re fine with the 2005 model for your needs, the 2005 model can only handle 1GB of RAM.<br />
These PowerPC G4 Mac Minis cannot run a whole lot of software that’s current but it you do need to upgrade the ram on these models be sure to add DDR PC2700 memory upgrades for these models</p>

  </p>
</div>

<p>I’ve been thinking a lot about the Apple Mac Mini and I think the 2014 models have been <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/2014/11/not-the-upgrade-we-were-hoping-for-the-2014-mac-mini-reviewed/">given</a> a <a href="http://www.tekrevue.com/soldered-ram-new-mac-mini/">bum rap</a>.</p>

<p>A google search will take you about 30 seconds to find more than one opinion piece about how the 2014 Mac Mini is <strong>not the deal it once was</strong> and that there’s no replaceable parts any more in the new Mac Mini and that the 2014 is one big disappointment from Apple.</p>

<p>Personally, I think that’s a good thing you can no longer open them up.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="this-has-been-coming-for-some-time">This Has Been Coming for Some Time.</h2>

<p>Ever so slowly, Apple has been removing the ability to work on the innards of your new computer and this applies to almost the entire lineup for 2014 and beyond.</p>

<p>Chances are if you’re here looking for a ram upgrade it’s for an older Mac vs a newer one and you’re just trying to squeeze a bit more life out of your current model, because if you have a relatively new Mac made in the last year or two <strong>you can’t upgrade it either</strong>.</p>

<p>It’s no longer possible for you to upgrade almost every model Apple makes save for the iMac and the Mac Pro, and I think this is a good strategy on Apple’s part.</p>

<p>Portable computers are fragile enough without having them be user upgradeable and all the problems that come with that. On un-upradeable Macs, the RAM can be soldered down, hard drives don’t need to be swapped and batteries are non replaceable, and all this is because…</p>

<h2 id="meet-apple-the-appliance-company">Meet Apple: the Appliance Company.</h2>

<p>It’s my opinion that Apple wants to sell you a <strong>suitable computer for today</strong> and they don’t want to sell you a computer you can use tomorrow.</p>

<p>In a perfect Apple world you would buy a new computer every time they announced one, but thankfully they make pretty good stuff that will last you for longer than that. It’s not uncommon to get <a href="http://www.lowendmac.com">longer life</a> out of your computer and considering that Apple will allow you to finance a computer for 2 years that’s a good safe bet to how long you can use your Mac knowing you’re not too far behind the technology curve and your 2 year old Mac will do everything a new Mac can do.</p>

<p>This brings me back to the Mac Mini. It’s a cheap computer that’s easy to use with any monitor and keyboard and mouse. You can use it as a media server, <a href="http://macminicolo.net/">web server</a> or even just as it’s true intended use as a personal computer for home or small business for people like, well… me.</p>

<p>And the Mac Mini is perfect for that and now that it’s closed to upgrades this makes it perfect for this task as the lack of chance to upgrade makes it the only desktop computer from Apple that’s plug and play with <strong>your accessories</strong> and not theirs and yet you don’t have to worry about adding some more parts to the thing before you can use it.</p>

<p>You don’t have to buy a 5K monitor to use the Mac Mini. You can buy a cheap $100 (or less) monitor and add a $20 keyboard and mouse combo and you have a <strong>brand new Apple desktop for under $600.00</strong></p>

<p>Lord knows you can <a href="http://www.apple.com/imac-with-retina/">spend more on a desktop</a> and you get a much nicer display and faster processor but for a lot of us, myself included – we don’t need much when it comes to using a Mac. At least I don’t.</p>

<p>I don’t edit photos on my Mac when my iPad can do it better and faster.</p>

<p>All I need a Mac for is to write here on ramseeker and although I could use my <a href="http://www.macstories.net">iPad as my only device</a> I really prefer a full sized display and keyboard at a desk. I work from home most of the time so a a cheap Apple desktop is fine by me.</p>

<h2 id="how-much-mac-do-you-really-need-to-buy">How Much Mac Do You Really Need To Buy?</h2>

<p>In 2015 I think that the folks like me are the people that the Mac Mini will cater to. Personally, I just want a Mac that will run some current sofware for writing like <a href="http://www.bywordapp.com">byword</a> or <a href="http://desk.pm">desk</a> and that’s pretty much all I need. Add a browser and maybe an application or two like <a href="http://www.skype.com">skype</a> and I am good to go.</p>

<h2 id="it-just-works">It Just Works</h2>

<p>The Mac Mini comes with enough ram (4gb) and enough storage space (500gb) and a fast enough processor (1.4GHz dual-core Intel Core i5) all wrapped in a small little package that fits behind your TV as well as it does on your desk. You don’t have upgrade it because it doesn’t need upgrading.</p>

<p>To me that sounds like the <strong>perfect Apple product if there ever was one</strong></p>

<p>The Mac Mini has never been about speed. There’s <a href="http://www.apple.com/mac-pro/">other macs for that</a> if you need to have the fastest Mac you can buy today. But if you’re just needing a small and cheap computer at under $500 it’s hard to beat the value of the Mac Mini regardless of it’s upgradability</p>

<p>This $500 computer can run the same software and operating system as the faster models. It might not run as fast but there’s a very good chance it will run. I can’t think of any software you could not run on the 2014 Mac Mini. You still get iTunes, Safari and Time Machine backups and all the other stuff Mac OS X includes for free and it all just works.</p>

<p>To summarize, I am fine with the non upgradeable Mac Mini. If I want a faster or lighter computer I will buy a MacBook Air or a 2015 MacBook. You can’t upgrade either of these <a href="http://www.macsales.com">(unless you ask OWC)</a> but again, the idea here is to buy it and use it and get a newer model down the road. Apple wants to sell you an Appliance to use for a couple of years until they can sell you another one.</p>

<p>The beauty of the Mac Mini and a lot of Apple computers is the resale value. You can buy this 2014 Mac Mini, with it’s many perceived flaws and then when an upgrade comes you can sell your old Mac Mini and buy a new one and I bet you would only be out a couple of hundred dollars for the new model.</p>

<p>Would I love for the new Mac Mini to have a fast SSD and more RAM? Of course I would. But I don’t need either for my everyday and I bet a lot of others don’t either.</p>

<h2 id="more-options-are-available">More Options Are Available</h2>

<p>If I do want more RAM or a faster SSD – I can have both of those. I just have to <strong>pay Apple</strong> (including the Apple tax) for them. This might mean I am now looking at a Mac Mini that costs twice the amount of the entry level model, and if I have a $1000 budget for an Apple computer then the game just changed.</p>

<p>With $1000 I can buy another entry level computer I like: the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/2015/03/macbook-air-vs-macbook-pro-what-to-buy-in-2015/" title="MacBook Air vs MacBook Pro: What to Buy in 2015?">MacBook Air</a> and get SSD storage, and the portability and display for even less than the souped up Mac Mini.</p>

<p>But I am not really here to talk about the Mac Mini that costs $1000. I am here to talk about the cheap model. The ‘everyman’s Mac’ if you will. The ‘good enough’ Mac for those of us who really don’t need the portability, speed or high resolutions displays that more expensive Macs might offer us and we just want a Mac that’s cheap and that works out of the box without any upgrades needed. The Mac Mini meets these requirements and then some.</p>

<p>At under $500 it’s a heck of a deal and the cheapest Apple computer you can buy in 2015.</p>

<p>After musing about what <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/2015/03/macbook-air-vs-macbook-pro-what-to-buy-in-2015/">apple notebook I would buy</a> I got to thinking: We all know the soon to be released Apple MacBook is the <strong>lightest Apple computer ever</strong> but what about the other models? How much do they weigh? Does more SSD hard drive space make a computer heavier? What about RAM? Does that make a computer heavier? Let’s have a look:</p>

<h2 id="the-macbook-is-the-lightest-apple-computer-you-can-buy">The MacBook is the Lightest Apple Computer You can Buy</h2>

<p>So there you have it. The lightest Apple computer is the soon to be available MacBook followed by the MacBook Air 11 and 13 inch, and MacBook Pro 13 inch and 15 inch models</p>

<h2 id="the-27-inch-imac-is-the-heaviest-computer-you-can-buy">The 27 inch iMac is the Heaviest Computer You can Buy</h2>

<p>The lightest desktop computer of course, is the Apple Mac Mini but curiously, the 2.8Ghz model is .1 lb heavier than the other slower Mac Mini models. Interestingly the weight of the Retina 5K iMac is the same weight as the the non-retina iMacs. I would have guessed that the better display would have to weigh more, but I guess resolution does not affect the weight of a computer.</p>

<h2 id="inch-macbook-pros-still-weigh-a-lot-15-inch-macbook-pros-still-weigh-a-lot">15 inch MacBook Pros Still Weigh a Lot {#15-inch-macbook-pros-still-weigh-a-lot}</h2>

<p>It’s surprising to see the weight of the MacBook Pros still weigh as much. A <a href="http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/powerbook_g4/specs/powerbook_g4_1.5_15.html">PowerBook G4</a> that’s a <strong>over a decade older</strong> only weighs about a lb more, and my guess the big weight saving of that pound are from the removal of the optical drive and traditional hard drive that the new MacBook Pros no longer have. If MacBook Pros had to still have these two things I bet we would still see their weight be closer to six lbs like the PowerBooks were.</p>

<p>No wonder the MacBook Airs were so popular – the 11 inch was the lightest model you could buy until the new MacBook released a week or so ago and were <strong>half the weight</strong> of a 15inch MacBook Pro. I have slugged around enough 5lb notebooks to tell you that it’s no fun after a while on the back and shoulders.</p>

<h2 id="how-important-is-notebook-weight">How Important is Notebook Weight?</h2>

<p>When it comes to the new MacBook and it’s lack of weight, I wonder how light a notebook needs to be? Yes, slogging a 5lb notebook around gets old but there’s a big tradeoff with the new MacBook for that little weight, and it’s no MacBook Pro. The screen is very nice, but the keyboard seems to take some time to adjust to and as has been discussed ad nauseum, the lack of ports might be a problem.</p>

<p>If Apple discontinues the MacBook Air lineup, then there’s a big weight jump between the 2lb MacBook and the almost 3.5 lbs the 13 inch MacBook Pro. Currently the MacBook Airs fill the 2-3lbs weight category quite nicely but the design is getting stale so I wouldn’t be surprised to see this lineup go sooner than later.</p>

  </p>
</div>

<p>I have been shopping for a new Mac recently and lately it’s come down to two choices:</p>

<h2 id="macbook-pro-vs-macbook-air">MacBook Pro vs MacBook Air</h2>

<p>Both are really designed for different purposes and different price points and I would like to compare both and see what one would really fit my needs. I mostly just work with text now and really don’t need the extra cost of the MacBook Pro but when shopping for a new computer I like to sit down and write about what might be the best choice for me.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="pros-for-the-macbook-air">Pros for the MacBook Air</h2>

<p><strong>Price</strong></p>

<p>I am leaning towards the 11 inch MacBook Air and probably the cheapest model. I am finding that I don’t need a whole lot of processing power in a notebook computer and the 11 inch MacBook Air retails for just $899.00 vs $1299.00 for the 13 inch MacBook Pro.</p>

<p>In both cases I would buy the cheaper of the two models. I find that with the technology changing so fast, unless you need the power the value of the higher end models is not worth it to me.</p>

<p><strong>Size</strong></p>

<p>The Macbook Air is smaller both in physical size and weight, and although I do the vast majority of my work at a desk it would be nice to tuck the notebook under my arm and use it as a portable computer from time to time, and the MacBook Pro is much heavier at almost 3.5 lbs vs the 2.4lbs of the MacBook Air.</p>

<p>That’s about all the MacBook Air has going for it for me – size and price, with price being the dominant factor. Assuming you get 2 years out of the MacBook Air, the financing works out to $43.00 a month or about $1.50 a day to get into the MacBook Air.</p>

<h2 id="pros-for-the-macbook-pro">Pros for the MacBook Pro</h2>

<p><strong>The Display</strong></p>

<p>Not only is the display on the MacBook Pro bigger it’s <strong>also better</strong> on the MacBook Pro with it’s retina IPS display vs the older TN technology of the MacBook Air. If you’re going to stare at the Macbook Pro for hours on end then it might be worth it to spend the $400 premium of the Macbook Pro to get the much sharper and brighter retina display. The display also offers much more real estate, which I don’t think I really need. I just write and any display frankly will do me for the work I do. One might argue that the Macbook Pro offers more room to work but I don’t see the smaller MacBook Air display to be that big of a hindrance.</p>

<p><strong>The Speed</strong></p>

<p>This is another area the Macbook Pro will blow the doors off the MacBook Air. The MacBook Pro is fitted with a 1.6GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor vs the 2.7GHz dual-core Intel Core i5<br />
Turbo Boost up to 3.1GHz. If you need to do a lot of higher end work like image editing and video, both of these I don’t do – then it might be worth the upgrade</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>The MacBook Air is smaller and cheaper, but slower and the display isn’t half as nice.</p>

<p>The MacBook Pro is faster and has a bigger and much nicer display.</p>

<p>You really can’t go wrong with both but if you’re just working with text like I tend to be lately you really can’t go wrong with the 11 inch MacBook Air as it’s the only Apple notebook you can buy new for under $1000. Even the fancy new and thin MacBook has a $1300 price tag.</p>

<p>Some may argue that the MacBook Air is older technology and is a 2010 computer filled with 2015 innards and not much else has changed. The screen is still sub par and much smaller but the weight and power and overall value of the MacBook Air is hard to beat at about $45.00 a month.</p>

<p>On the other hand if you can afford or justify the better display and the higher cost the MacBook Pro can be had for just $62.00 a month, or about two dollars a day over the 2 year finance rate. If you can cough up the extra $15.00 a month and need the more power and the much nicer display then the MBP is the way to go.</p>

<p>But for me, I really can’t justify the extra cost of the MacBook Pro when the MacBook Air looks to be the perfect blogging and writing machine and that’s what I tend to do the most of in 2015. I think I will spend my money on the Macbook Air this time around when buying a new Apple notebook this year.</p>

</div>

<p>In 2015, there are many reasons to upgrade the ram in a laptop, but the most important is speed. Simply put, more ram makes your notebook or laptop run faster than it would without.</p>

<h2 id="what-to-look-for-in-laptop-ram">What to look for in laptop ram</h2>

<p>The first thing to look for when looking to add more memory to your notebook is whether you can upgrade or not. Some of the newer notebooks like the 2015 <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;field-keywords=macbook&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;rh=i:aps,k:macbook&amp;tag=replaceable-20&amp;url=search-alias=aps&amp;linkId=A5KSJHMZAOOYIZGS">MacBook</a> or the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;ajr=0&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;field-keywords=dell%20xps&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;rh=i:aps,k:dell%20xps&amp;tag=replaceable-20&amp;url=search-alias=aps&amp;linkId=SB3D6T6PR7BFI22T">Dell XPS 13</a> ship with the RAM soldered on the motherboard meaning you’re out of luck when it comes to upgrading so be sure to buy the most ram you can afford at the time of purchase.</p>

<p>But if you can upgrade the ram on your notebook computer it’s best to do so because ram is <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/2015/03/how-much-does-ram-cost/">pretty cheap these days</a> and in most instances you can upgrade the ram to twice what was installed in the computer.</p>

<h2 id="apple-laptop-ram">Apple Laptop RAM</h2>

<p>One of the most <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com">popular ram prices</a> I monitor memory prices for are Apple Computers. Some newer models <strong>all have their ram soldered to the motherboard</strong> so it you’re looking to upgrade ram on an Apple notebook prior to 2012 you’re pretty much out of luck.</p>

<h2 id="dell-laptop-ram">Dell Laptop RAM</h2>

<p>I have mentioned earlier that the Dell XPS for 2015 cannot be upgraded but some older XPS models can be so like the Apple models you’re best to check out how much ram your notebook takes. The Dell consumer models like the Dell Inspiron models can take a ram upgrade and you can usually at least double the ram from 4GB standard to 8GB for well under $100.00</p>

<p>Dell Alienware models usually ship with all the ram they need as they are professional gaming computers and need all the performance and speed they can get and so have the ram installed at time of manufacturer.</p>

<p>Dell Latitude memory upgrades are available for current models as these are business models that are priced to be competitive in the market and one way of meeting a certain price point is to add the minimum amount of RAM and let the business or consumer’s IT department add more memory later if needed</p>

<h2 id="hp-laptop-ram">HP Laptop RAM</h2>

<p>HP computers come in a wide array of models from entry level ultrabooks to high end gaming computers and they can all use a memory upgrade. Some might be soldered to the motherboard but a lot of ram upgrades are still available with common upgrade prices usually around the $100 mark for HP Laptop memory – maybe a bit more for 16GB HP notebook ram kits.</p>

<h2 id="ram-for-notebooks-is-cheap-in-2015">RAM for Notebooks is Cheap in 2015</h2>

<p>The prices for ram for notebook computers used to be much higher than they are now and cost a fraction of the price, but if you are looking to buy a ram upgrade for your notebook the cost will be about $75.00 for 8GB of RAM and $125.00 for 16GB of RAM for upgrading your laptop to the most ram it can handle.</p>

<p>With Apple’s release of the 2015 MacBook Pro refreshes earlier this month there’s a few things you might want to know about the 2015 MacBook Pro models vs the 2014 versions:</p>

<h2 id="not-all-macbook-pros-are-the-same">Not All MacBook Pros Are The Same</h2>

<p>Only Some of the [MacBook Pro models saw an upgrade][1]. The 15 inch models did not get an upgrade at all and are still stuck with 2014 specifications. In fact, only 3 models got an upgrade for 2015:</p>

<p>13 inch 2.7Ghz with Retina Display (128GB and 256GB) and the 13 inch 2.9Ghz with retina display.</p>

<p>All others are still stuck on last year’s specifications with the 13 inch 2.5Ghz non retina display model being the only 13 inch MacBook Pro without an upgrade. The 15 inch display also did not see an upgrade at all either.</p>

<p>If you want to buy a new MacBook Pro for 2015 so far it will be one of the 3 that saw the updates.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="macbook-pros-are-still-expensive">MacBook Pros are Still Expensive</h2>

<p>Maybe the ‘pro’ in the name should have been the giveaway but these are still priced at over a thousand dollars for even the cheapest MacBook Pro you can buy at $1099.00 and really can’t compare with the other models with more RAM, faster processors, <strong>much faster storage</strong> [1][2]{#fnref-storage.footnote} and a much nicer screen</p>

<p>So really, the bargain of the bunch when it comes to the new MacBook Pro models are the 13 inch 2.7Ghz Retina display models. With 8GB of RAM standard on the $1299.00 model, the only difference between the 2.7Ghz models are the size of the storage. If you want more storage the upgrade from 128GB to 256GB is $200.00.</p>

<p>The most expensive 13 inch MacBook Pro for 2015 is the 2.9Ghz with a 7% increase in speed over the 2.7Ghz models you might want to ask yourself if it’s really worth it to buy the most expensive model that starts at $1799.00 for the high end 13 incher.</p>

<p>The 15 inch models even get stupider and cost $1999.00 and $2499.00. The <strong>cheap</strong> 15 inch model is 2.2GHz with 16GB of RAM and 256GB storage and the most expensive MacBook Pro you can buy is 2.5Ghz and 16GB of RAM with 512GB SSD storage.</p>

<p>Now you do get a bigger screen with the 15 inch vs 13 inch models so you might want to think about how much screen real estate you really need. The difference in size and weight is another thing to consider and not just the cost.</p>

<h2 id="dont-buy-the-cheapest-macbook-pro">Don’t Buy The Cheapest Macbook Pro</h2>

<p>It’s old technology and you will hate it very soon. I can’t think of using anything but solid state storage in any notebook anymore and unless you really can’t afford anything else I can’t recommend this model. If you’re on a budget the cheapest Mac Portable you can buy is the [MacBook Air][3], and these saw an upgrade too this year and are still well under $1000 too.</p>

<h2 id="dont-buy-the-most-expensive-macbook-pro">Don’t Buy The Most Expensive MacBook Pro</h2>

<p>Unless you have money to burn, the higher end MacBook Pros are really not recommended at this time due to their older design so that leaves you with asking what 13 inch MacBook Pro to get?</p>

<p>I always look to get the middle model as I feel it has the best value. Of the three 13 inch models that were released in March 2015, the only difference between the two cheaper models are storage space and the fact the most expensive model costs a lot more with just a small increase in speed and some more storage makes me wonder if I need all that speed and storage.</p>

<p>I guess it all comes down to what you plan to do with your MacBook? If you’re blogging and checking email then the 2.7Ghz Retina display at $1299.00 would be my pick but if you have to make money with your MacBook Pro and time is money then maybe it’s worth it to buy the <strong>most expensive model</strong> and know that you have the fastest Apple notebook you can buy today</p>

<p>But if it were my money, I would pick the $1299.00 model as 128GB of storage is just fine for me when it comes to storage space.</p>

<h2 id="the-new-models-have-force-trackpads">The New Models Have Force Trackpads</h2>

<p>Do you need a force trackpad? Probably not – at least right now that there’s minimal support for it and until a week or so this didn’t even exist, but you might as well get the one model of the MacBook Pro that has <strong>all the features</strong> and the 13 inch models feature this new technological advance in trackpads so you may as well buy a future proof trackpad instead of something with older technology</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>Do your homework when shopping for a new MacBook Pro and I am sure you will find a model that suits your needs and budget and will last you a very long time compared to other Windows or Linux notebooks.</p>

  </p>
</div>

<p><a href="http://www.lowendmac.com">Low  End  Mac  </a>was one of the very first sites I ever came across way back when,  and has been a favorite ever since and you will find that this is a very useful resource for the Apple community.</p>

<p>It’s especially fun to check out their <strong>Mac of the Day </strong>feature and see how the older Apple computers have aged.  There are other sites that highlight older computers, but like the name suggests Low End Mac does this very well and has information you can’t get or find any more for the older Apple computers.</p>

<p>They offer <a href="http://lowendmac.com/profiles.htm">technical specs</a> to pretty much every mac you can think of  which can be handy when you need to know how much ram  your older mac can  take for an example. <img src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> .  Also be sure to check out the articles for some great stuff on how to get the most of your older Mac.</p>

<p>I think that even more so now than in the past  – despite all the hoopla about the latest and greatest computers like the new MacBook, etc – you can still get very good mileage out of some older computers. Personally, I have posted blog posts for this site from a ten year old PowerBook G4 so  I’m a fan of Low End  Mac, (as well as being cheap) <img src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p>There are a lot of resources on the web about new macs and all the rumors and headlines, but Low End Mac is one  of the  few sites to help you be happy with what you’ve got.</p>

<p>Here’s  a few of my favorite articles recently:</p>

<p>Prices may change over time, but you should expect to pay that much for ram you buy and replace your old ram that came pre-installed when you bought your computer</p>

<div id="asa-6bb7eaf10f48a75bbd2c72446f935a4b" class="asa_async_container asa_async_container_default">
</div>

<p>The good news is you <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/2011/01/where-can-i-sell-old-ram/">can sell your old ram</a>t to recover some of the price of the new ram by trading in your old ram.</p>

<p>You won’t get a whole lot for your old ram trade in, but you will get some money back when you send in your old ram for trade in. According to <a href="http://eshop.macsales.com/tech_center/support/rebates/memory.cfm">Other World Computing</a> you could get $37.00 for 8GB of MacBook Pro ram from either Apple or their own OWC brand.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>This trade in value would get your cost for 16GB of MacBook Pro RAM down to under $100 to double your ram in your Apple notebook from 8GB to 16GB, and as I have stated before, unless you are doing very CPU intensive work then **16GB of RAM will be all the RAM you ever need. **</p>

<h2 id="apple-memory-ram-costs">Apple Memory RAM Costs</h2>

<p>The bummer with Apple memory is that replaceable memory modules are going the way of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodo">Dodo bird</a>. If you have a MacBook Pro newer than 2012 you had better have upgraded it when you bought it because otherwise you are out of luck and stuck with your current amount of RAM.</p>

<p>This holds true for Apple MacBook Air models that have **never been able to accept a ram upgrade **and on the desktop front, this applies to the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00746X7G2/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00746X7G2&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkId=F6XSHGULSJDLX6L4">2014 Mac Mini</a> too. The only Apple computers you can upgrade are the Apple iMacs and Mac Pros, and I would not be surprised if you will soon not be able to upgrade the iMacs much further either. I think that in the future iMacs will come preconfigured with RAM upgrades just like the notebooks and that just leaves the Mac Pros that can accept a memory upgrade.</p>

<h2 id="windows-8-ram-upgrade-costs">Windows 8 RAM Upgrade Costs</h2>

<p>If you’re in the market for a memory upgrade for a windows or PC notebook you might have better luck with getting a ram upgrade for your Windows notebook but even this is changing over time. Some of the most popular windows PC’s like the <a href="http://Enter URLhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00RY4X8A4/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00RY4X8A4&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkId=KMYUJFUIAI4WTQBP">2015 Dell XPS</a> and the <a href="http://Enter URLhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00SGS7ZH4/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00SGS7ZH4&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkId=VJQZSSQRZK3GR4I4">Asus X305</a> notebooks cannot take an upgrade as like the Apple notebooks the RAM is soldered onto the motherboard.</p>

<p>The minimum memory requirements for <a href="http://Enter URLhttp://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/system-requirements">Windows 8 is just 2GB</a> but I think that is being a **little optimistic **in how much ram your notebook needs to run Windows well. I would think that you would want to have double the memory in a Windows notebook with at least **4GB of RAM. **</p>

<p>If you check the minimum ram on the Apple website it will too state that you need just 2GB of RAM for Mac OS but like the Windows 8 requirements I would not think about using a computer from Apple with at least 4GB of RAM, and preferably 8. Even the newer Apple MacBook ships with 8GB of RAM, but the MacBook Air models come with just 4GB so in 2015 I can suggest your computer come with at least 4GB of RAM.</p>

<p>This 4GB minimum of RAM really isn’t that hard to meet as there are many <a href="http://Enter URLhttp://www.amazon.com/s/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;field-availability=-1&amp;field-price-mp-owner-bin=00000-39999&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;node=565108&amp;pf_rd_i=565108&amp;pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_p=1952904682&amp;pf_rd_r=1Q3T80QS4YHJ1QKS3GD1&amp;pf_rd_s=merchandised-search-leftnav&amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkId=5ZDYFNBGPZIR7CE5">Windows notebooks under $400</a> that ship with <strong>at least 4gb of RAM</strong>, and if you spend more you get 8GB as the default so it’s not too hard to be sure you have 4GB of RAM in your notebook or desktop when you want to run Windows OS.</p>

<p>And if you have an older Mac or Windows machine you are really going to benefit from an upgrade from 2GB to 4GB if your machine can support it. It’s a great way to get some more mileage out of your older Mac or PC and yet the upgrade will<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001265GI2/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001265GI2&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkId=V57NWLW5TILQEHTY"> cost very little</a>.</p>

<h2 id="does-different-memory-types-cost-more">Does Different Memory Types Cost More?</h2>

<p>This really depends on the memory type you are looking to upgrade. If you are looking for the best prices for modern memory technology like DDR3 1600Mhz so-dimms or sdram for desktops then the prices for most brands with comparable sizes cost pretty much the same.</p>

<p>Where the costs do change is if you are looking to upgrade the RAM to performance memory for those that demand the best and fastest RAM you can buy and the extra cost is worth the extra performance. Gamers and Photographers are two groups that might prefer to have faster ram.</p>

<p>But if you’re the average user, just find a good brand of RAM like <a href="http://www.crucial.com">Crucial</a>, <a href="http://www.kingston.com">Kingston</a>, <a href="http://www.macsales.com">OWC</a> and other brands and you’re all set to go. Here’s a few examples of good prices on RAM for Mac or PC, desktop or notebook:</p>

<div id="asa-ea53b6e8ea1a21ecae33f6ca204d7d3d" class="asa_async_container asa_async_container_default">

<div id="asa-9d313e9cf199342e354365a3cc4e1da2" class="asa_async_container asa_async_container_default">
</div>

<p>To summarize, ram for Mac, Windows and Linux should not cost you a lot of money and with some shopping and trading in your old RAM you might be able to get all the ram you need to buy for $100. Just be sure to check with the memory manufacturer to be sure you can upgrade the RAM in your computer.</p>

<p>I was just pricing out a new MacBook Pro (the 13 incher) and noted that they really aren’t that expensive and also even though the RAM is not upgradeable on this model you can order it from Apple with 16GB vs the 8GB and I have to tell you: the prices Apple charges for RAM <strong>really isn’t that bad!</strong></p>

<!--more-->

<p>It was not too long ago that if you wanted to upgrade to 16GB from 8GB you could expect to pay a very pretty penny when you buy the<a href="http://store.apple.com/us/mac/mac-accessories/memory"> ram directly from Apple</a>, and for older Macs like 2012 MacBook Pros – one of the last MacBook Pro models that could take a user installable memory upgrade – this still seems to be the case, where Apple is currently charging over double what they should for a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005LDLVAO/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B005LDLVAO&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=ramseeker-20">comparable memory part. </a></p>

<p>But if you buy a 2015 Apple MacBook Pro and  then when you go to check out and bump up the ram to 16GB from 8GB at time of purchase, the ram price upgrade from <a href="http://store.apple.com/us/buy-mac/macbook-pro?product=MF839LL/A&amp;step=config#">8 to 16GB is just $200</a>, which is not outrageous like Apple RAM prices once were. At one time you would pay  a whole lot more money for 16GB of ram for the MBP if you were to buy it from Apple.</p>

<p>Take a look at the memory chart above: To upgrade to 8GB on an older 2012 and later model MacBook Pro, you will see that places like <a href="http://www.macsales.com">OWC</a>  and <a href="http://www.datamem.com">Data Memory Systems</a> are currently charging about  $140-$180.00 <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008LTBJFW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B008LTBJFW&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=ramseeker-20">for the  16GB memory upgrade kit</a> </strong>, but Apple charges $200 for half the amount of RAM at 8GB.</p>

<h2 id="is-a-16gb-ram-upgrade-from-apple-worth-it">Is a 16GB RAM Upgrade from Apple Worth It?</h2>

<p>So the question I need to ask is <strong>is it worth it to upgrade a 2015 MacBook Pro </strong>to 16gb when you buy it directly from Apple, and I have to say that this is the very first year I can say this with any sort of confidence, but yes it is.</p>

<p>Sure, you pay  a bit of Apple Tax on the ram upgrade compared to a 16GB kit for an older upgradable machine, but for the newest  MacBook Pros (and others) the only way to get to the maximum ram allowable for the Mac is to buy the ram at time of purchase from the <a href="http://store.apple.com">Apple Store</a> so you really only have one option anyway, and $200 for a 16GB ram upgrade is currently not that bad of a price.</p>

<h2 id="the-true-cost-of-a-20000-16gb-ram-upgrade-from-apple">The  True Cost of a $200.00  16GB RAM Upgrade from Apple</h2>

<p>But, then there’s the question of whether a ram upgrade of 16GB is worth it for a MacBook Pro vs the 8GB they ship with for the stock configuration, and  I think the answer is yes, and Ithink that the  $200 price increase is a worthy upgrade, and here’s why:</p>

<p><strong>Let’s choose the 2015 MacBook Pro with 2.7Ghz  and Retinal Display: </strong></p>

<p>Out of the box this model ships with 8GB of RAM and is priced at $1299.00, say $1300 for a round number. Add the 8GB upgrade to 16GB total and your new MacBook Pro  now costs $1500.00 with the more memory pre-installed.</p>

<p>Let’s assume you keep the MacBook Pro for 2 years. I think this is a very reasonable time to consider that you will stay with the same Apple computer. A 2017 MacBook Pro might be something completely different and will no doubt be faster and lighter than your once new 2015 model, but it should run most programs still and the latest operating system with ease. Unless you need to be on the bleeding edge of technology there’s no reason why you couldn’t get even more than 3 years out of it.</p>

<h2 id="the-math-what-a-16gb-macbook-pro-really-costs">The Math: What a 16GB MacBook Pro Really Costs</h2>

<p>Apple will happily finance the base model to you at $61.00 and change a month (on approved credit, etc). If you add the $200 option you are now raising  the financing cost ten dollars a month over the course of the term, which is in this example 24 months.</p>

<p>If you keep the MacBook Pro for 3 years, you’re paying  $500 a year to own your MacBook Pro. But that assumes your notebook has zero value at the end  of the 3 years and we know that’s not true and  it would not be hard at all to get a 50% trade in on your old Mac. This brings your costs down even further to $250.00 a year for 16GB 2015 MacBook Pro, or just over $20.00 a month for the 16GB model.</p>

<p>This is a current notebook with much more than <a href="http://www.lowendmac.com">three years of life in them</a>, and all it costs is about $20.00 a month. I think this is a pretty good deal for a MacBook Pro. If you’re a professional you can <strong>easily </strong>realize more than $20.00 a month with your notebook, and  even if you’re a student or a mommy blogger you can also get twenty dollars of value with a fast portable MacBook with a full amount of memory that just works.</p>

<p>This is why I suggest to <strong>always, always add the maximum amount of RAM</strong> you can to your computer. Even with the cost Apple charges for the upgrade, if you keep your computer in good shape it will have a very high resale value even a few years later and the true cost of owning your maxed out MacBook Pro will really only cost about the same as a few lattes from Starbucks every month.</p>

<p>It’s been some time since I wrote about the product MacBook as the last models were about 2010, but after half a decade of discontinuation, Apple’s <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbook/">announcement</a> changed all that and now if you’re going to buy a new Apple notebook computer in 2015 you have to ask your self – <strong>MacBook or MacBook Pro?</strong></p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="macbook-pros">2015 MacBook Pros</h2>

<h3 id="less-weight">Less Weight</h3>

<p>The benefits of the 2015 MacBook are more than a few, but the most obvious change for this <strong>brand new notebook from Apple</strong> is the size and weight of the notebook compared to other notebooks in this class. At just 2lbs in weight, this is the lightest notebook you can buy today from Apple, aside from buying an iPad and using it with an Apple Keyboard, but that’s really a different story compared to the MacBook because the iPad runs on a completely different operating system and as such is not really a fair comparison and some would argue that even with a keyboard the iPad is not a real computer (some would <a href="http://www.macstories.net/stories/ipad-air-2-review-why-the-ipad-became-my-main-computer/">argue differently</a>).</p>

<h3 id="less-ports">Less Ports</h3>

<p>So with the release of the Apple MacBook we have not only lightness compared to the MacBook Pro but also a completely different design that removes almost all the ports. Unlike the MBP, the MacBook Air offers just two ports – one for power via a USB-C connector and a headphone jack. <strong>That’s it.</strong> This could be considered a pro or con depending on the user but for my needs, which is mostly writing articles just like this one – I don’t need to connect anything to a computer other than perhaps a wireless mouse, but if I really needed to I could buy a bluetooth mouse to use.</p>

<p>I am going to call the lack of ports a pro because with the advent of dropbox and Google Drive and other cloud computing hosts, there’s no real need for external hard drives and usb flash sticks. One thing I might miss would be a SD card reader, but a lot of the higher end and even enthusiasts cameras now include wi-fi, so that’s not even a big deal. And, if you do need to hang some accessories off the 2015 MacBook there are <a href="http://www.belkin.com/us/Device/Mac/d/MacBook/">dongles you can buy.</a> that will allow you to work with memory cards and other USB 2.0 and USB 3.0 legacy devices</p>

<h3 id="better-keyboard">Better Keyboard</h3>

<p>The keyboard. I have not been able to test the keyboard of the MacBook but I think that after getting used to the new design with the butterfly keys vs the scissor style keyboards that have been around for a decade or more, this should be a better designed keyboard, assuming you can get used to the less travel than traditional keyboards</p>

<h3 id="better-battery-life">Better Battery Life</h3>

<p>The new MacBook is rated at up to 9 hours of battery life, which is not as good as the ten hours of life the MacBook Pro is spec’d at but for a small computer that weighs just 2lbs this is really good all day battery performance on this new 2015 Apple notebook.</p>

<h3 id="better-display">Better Display</h3>

<p>The MacBook offers a 12 inch retina display, but is a bit deeper (or taller) than the MacBook Pro’s thanks to the 16:10 ratio vs the 16:9 ratio of the MacBook Pro models. You might not think this would be a big deal, but if you’re like me and spend pretty much all your time in a document or web, you will appreciate the deeper display for <strong>less scrolling</strong> that allows you too keep your hands on the keyboard vs the mouse or trackpad.</p>

<h2 id="macbook-pro-pros">2015 MacBook Pro Pros</h2>

<p> </p>

<p>The 2015 MacBook Pros have a few advantages over the 2015 MacBook:</p>

<h3 id="bigger-screen-sizes">Bigger Screen Sizes</h3>

<p>Even the smallest MacBook Pro has a 13 inch display vs the 12 inch display on the MacBook, and if you want to go bigger you can even buy a 15 inch MacBook Pro too. Of course, these MacBook Pros are heavier than Apple’s new light netbook, but if you need a bigger display in a portable from the fruit company, then your only options are MacBook Pro models.</p>

<h3 id="faster-processors-for-more-speed">Faster Processors for More Speed</h3>

<p>The MacBook is not designed to be the fastest Apple notebook you can buy and features a pretty lightweight Intel Core M processor vs the Intel Core i5 and i7 options on the pro. If you do heavy duty stuff with your computer than the Pro is the computer you want to buy.</p>

<h3 id="bigger-battery-life">Bigger Battery Life</h3>

<p>It’s not much, but the MacBook Pro Battery life is rated at 10 hours vs 9 for the MacBook. It’s not a big difference and in some cases might not matter at all but if you need every bit of portable power you can than the MBP is the notebook from Apple you need for all day portable power.</p>

<h3 id="more-ports">More Ports</h3>

<p>The MacBook Pros are equipped with the ports we exepect on a professional computer like USB 3.0, HDMI, SD card readers, thunderbolt ports and so on. If you have stuff you want to connect to your MacBook Pro and hate the idea of dongles hanging off your MacBook you need to spring for the Pro version of this computer.</p>

<h3 id="mag-safe-power">Mag Safe Power</h3>

<p>One of the best ideas Apple ever had was the Magsafe connector that disconnected if the cable was pulled. This has saved countless accidents from people tripping over power cables and has saved my bacon on more than one occassion. I hope the omittance of Mag Safe connector on the new MacBook Pro is just a temporary thing.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>To summarize, both of these portable Apple computer lines offer different things for different people. If you need the lightest computer from Apple you can possibly get, then the Apple MacBook is for you, assuming you can live with the less ports and power. But if you’re a power user the MacBook Pro is only 3.5lbs, which is still a considerable weight loss compared to older models. If you need speed, a bigger screen size and all the ports you could ask for then the MacBook Pro is the computer to buy.</p>

    The first place you should check for a refurbished Mac is <a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple</a>
  </p>
</div>

<p> </p>

<p>One of the best ways to get deals on an Apple computer is to <strong>buy an Apple Refurbished Model</strong> vs buying a new Apple computer because you will save money on an Apple notebook or desktop and in most cases you will not be able to tell the difference between new or refurbished Apple computers.</p>

<p>This also applies to iPhones and iPads and even Apple accessories too because just because it’s not new doesn’t mean you can’t get a great deal on a previously Apple item regardless of what that may be. Here’s a few places to look for refurbished Apple computers.<!--more--></p>

<h2 id="apple"><a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple</a></h2>

<p>This one is pretty obvious I think and in most cases I find that for the newer models especially or even the just discontinued Macs and iPads that the Apple Store itself tends to have some of the best prices on refurbished computers and you can be sure that these computers that ship from Apple are rerfurbished correctly. Heck, Apple even calls these <a href="http://store.apple.com/us/browse/home/specialdeals/mac">Certified Refurbished</a> and they come with free shipping and a one year warranty too making these the best deals on Mac products.</p>

<p>The savings depend on the model but expect the savings to be in the area of 15-20% off. Some examples of current refurbished deals are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Refurbished 13.3 inch MacBook Pro for $929.00</li>
  <li>Refurbished Mac Mini 2014 for $419.00</li>
  <li>Refurbished MacBook Pro 15.4 inch for $1489.00</li>
</ul>

<p>These deals come and go all the time but the three above are discounted about 15% off and still have a full one year warranty from Apple. It’s really hard to beat buying a refurbished product directly from Apple.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2 id="amazon"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;field-keywords=refurbished%20apple%20laptop&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;sprefix=refurbished%20a,aps,209&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;url=search-alias=aps&amp;linkId=LRTZDJ5QJ7HL4U2L">Amazon</a></h2>

<p>Amazon is also a good source for refurbished Mac computers due to the sheer size of the Amazon marketplace. Unlike Apple that tends to sell refurbished models that have been <strong>just</strong> discontinued or even current, the Amazon refurbished models are available on an entire lineup of Apple products regardless of year and are available from a vast array of vendors. If you need an older Mac and want to buy refurbished Amazon is a good place to check for deals.</p>

<h2 id="other-world-computing"><a href="http://www.macsales.com">Other World Computing</a></h2>

<p>OWC has been in the business of serving the Apple community for over 25 years so there’s no hesitation on my part to suggest you check out not only their memory and ram upgrades for both new and used Apple products but also their selection of <a href="http://eshop.macsales.com/shop/Apple_Systems/Used/Macs_and_Tablets">refurbished Apple products</a>. At the time of writing this, Mac Mini models start at under699 with MacBook Air refurbished models available at just $519.00 and up. Inventory changes all the time at OWC when it comes to refurbished and used Macs so be sure to check regularly for the most current deals.</p>

<h2 id="mac-of-all-trades"><a href="http://www.macofalltrades.com">Mac of All Trades</a></h2>

<p>Mac of All Trades is another store worth checking out if you’re in the market for a refurbished Mac to buy. In business for over 20 years this vendor specializes in used and refurbished Apple products and current examples of pricing include factory sealed MacBook Pro models for400.00</p>

<h2 id="mac-mall"><a href="http://www.macmall.com/n/Refurb-Outlet/macNavLinks-macNavLinks.57">Mac Mall</a></h2>

<p>MacMall is another place to check for refurbished Apple Macs and other items and like the other vendors above has been in business for years and years so you know you can get an Apple product you can save money on from a store you can trust. In addition to refurbished products MacMall always has a deal or two on new Macs too so be sure to <a href="http://www.macmall.com/n/Black-Friday/macCustomPages-1007">check this out too</a><br />
‘</p>

<h2 id="ebay"><a href="http://www.ebay.com">eBay</a></h2>

<p>Of course, there’s also eBay and you might be able to find a deal on a used Mac that might be refurbished by either the factory or more likely sold as seller refurbished, meaning that the vendor bought the Macs in bulk and then cleaned them up or made any needed repairs . The disadvantage of the eBay vendors is that the experience can vary greatly between vendors and you really have to do your homework on buying used or refurbished Macs at auction. But, you can get some good deals and most every product is protected by eBay’s money back guarantee.</p>

<p>To summarize, I would check with <a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple</a> first to see if I can buy the Mac I want as a refurbished model, and if I could wait I would wait until the model I wanted to buy was in stock. Some refurbished models tend to sell very quickly – like Mac Mini’s so you might be out of luck when you want to buy one but if you are patient the products usually tend to show up again on the certified refurbished page so you still might be able to save about 15% or so on the Mac you want to buy.</p>

    Mac Mini memory upgrades are <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;field-keywords=mac%20mini%20ram&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;linkId=KYHSLX55I3VIHO5Y">really cheap</a>
  </p>
</div>

<p>When shopping for a Mac Mini in 2015, one of the things you do not have to worry about are ram upgrades you can do your self because on the 2014 Mac Mini models you cannot upgrade the ram on your Mac Mini yourself. This means if you are looking to buy an Apple Mac Mini of the 2014 model you better be sure you buy the model with enough RAM for your needs, and for this year that means you can buy a new Mac Mini with 4GB, 8GB or 16GB maximum ram that’s soldered on the motherboard and that means you can’t upgrade the ram yourself.</p>

<!--more-->

<p><strong>The 4GB Mac Mini</strong></p>

<p>The 4GB Mac Mini for 2014 is the cheapest Mac Mini you can buy this year but it also has the lowest when it comes to ram maximums and this relatively minor amount of RAM might mean you might want to consider adding more RAM to the Mac Mini via the Apple Store at the time of purchase. But then your cheap Mac Mini that was under $500 is now much more expensive and you might be better off buying:</p>

<p><strong>The 8GB Mac Mini</strong></p>

<p>The 8GB Model is priced under $700 and not only do you get more RAM for the price you also get some other features like a faster processor, and larger hard drive. If you need even more RAM for your Mac Mini (in most cases, 8Gb would be enough for everyday use) then you might consider adding more RAM to the 8GB model to max out the Mac Mini to 16GB, or you could buy:</p>

<p><strong>The 16GB Mac Mini</strong></p>

<p>Where to Buy RAM for 2012 and Later Mac Mini</p>

<p>If you have an older Mac Mini or are considering buying one due to the fact that these later models allow you to swap out the RAM and hard drives yourself easily (the hard drive upgrade on the Mac Mini can take a bit of work) then you’re best off buying the Mac Mini RAM yourself and upgrading the RAM on your own to both speed up your Mac and get greater longevity from it too. It’s not uncommon to have ten year old Mac Mini models still in use, and I wonder if this will be the case on the most recent models?</p>

<p>The Mac Mini RAM you need to buy depends on year and model or even part number so you’re best to refer to a <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/2012/05/who-has-the-best-memory-finder/">memory compatability chart</a> or if you prefer, I have a page dedicated to helping you find the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/2014/10/mac-mini-memory-upgrade-prices/">right RAM for your Mac Mini</a> and once you know the type of RAM you need for the Mac Mini then all you need to do is to check the ram prices on Mac Mini RAM for your compatible model. Most recent Mac Mini models like the 2011 and 2012 models use <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/2014/10/mac-mini-memory-upgrade-prices/#ddr3-1600-mhz-memory-upgrade-prices">DDR3 1600Mhz memory</a> and the prices for RAM for these are reasonable and can be found at the following stores that sell memory for Mac Mini models:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">Amazon</a><br />
<a href="http://www.datamem.com">Data Memory Systems</a><br />
<a href="http://www.macsales.com">OWC</a><br />

<a href="http://www.memoryx.net">Memory X</a><br />
<a href="http://www.oempcworld.com">OEMPCWORLD</a></p>

<h2 id="the-best-ram-for-apple-mac-mini">The Best RAM for Apple Mac Mini</h2>

<p>Regardless of what store you buy Mac Mini RAM from you need to buy memory from a reputable manufacturer like Kingston Memory or Crucial Memory and you need to be sure it is compatible for your Mac Mini Model. Again, if you have a current 2012-2011 Mac Mini the ram you need to buy is here:</p>

<p>This is a reputable brand name (Crucial) and is a pretty good price for 16GB of RAM for the Mac Mini right now. If you need to buy less than 16GB of RAM then the 8GB RAM for Mac Mini is currently priced at under $100 and is a great way to upgrade the older Mac Mini models which tended to ship with as little as 2GB of RAM so an 8GB RAM upgrade will quadruple the memory in these models:</p>

		<div class="post-content"><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004YLCJXC/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004YLCJXC&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkId=XE4KRTJHTBRITMJJ"><img class="alignright wp-image-12862 " src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Screenshot-2015-03-13-at-1.36.42-PM-e1426854835667-300x218.png" alt="Screenshot 2015-03-13 at 1.36.42 PM" width="250" height="182" /></a>The Apple iMac might just be the best Mac to add more RAM too because it’s the only affordable desktop Mac that you <strong>can upgrade to 32GB</strong>. Unlike the MacBook Pro models that currently max out at 16Gb, the newer Apple iMac models can accept up to 32GB of RAM. <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/2014/10/apple-imac-memory-upgrade-prices/">See my chart</a> to see if your iMac can add that much ram, and if it can be sure to max out your RAM.</p>

<p>You will need to buy at least one 16GB RAM Upgrade kit for Apple iMac to get to the 32GB maximum. This depends on what your iMac shipped with from the factory. If you already have 16Gb of RAM you can just add another 16GB to get to the 32GB Max. Here’s a suggestion for an iMac 16GB RAM upgrade:<!--more--></p>

<p>This ram upgrade will work in the newest 5K retina iMac as well as some other models too from 2010 to 2013 as well so again, be sure to check my iMac ram compatibility chart to see how much RAM you can handle.</p>

<p>Don’t forget that if you need to replace the iMac ram you already have that you <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/2011/01/where-can-i-sell-old-ram/">can trade ram in</a> and get the ram even cheaper. There’s not a whole lot of memory stores that accept ram trades for older Macs but some do and it’s worth it to check it out if you’re not going to used the pulled ram when you upgrade.</p>

<p>My usual list of where to buy iMac RAM also applies to other Apple models too because in most cases if you have a relatively modern Mac from say the last 3 years or so, they <strong>all take the same memory upgrade</strong> so this advice on where to buy ram for iMac could also apply to MacBook Pro ram and Mac Mini Ram too because it’s all the same and the only difference is <strong>how much ram they can take</strong></p>

<p> </p>

<h2 id="imac-memory-upgrade-stores">iMac Memory Upgrade Stores</h2>

<p>The ram upgrade I linked to above is a memory upgrade from Amazon and it’s made by Crucial. Both the store or the brand don’t need an introduction and if you’re in the market to buy crucial ram over some other brand I find that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;field-keywords=crucial%20ram&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;sprefix=crucial%20ram,aps&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;url=search-alias=aps&amp;linkId=ISXRPOVF5JPSRMSF">best prices for Crucial ram</a> are from Amazon, and even though Crucial has their own online store you will tend to pay more there vs Amazon.</p>

<h2 id="crucial"><a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-1548159-10273954">Crucial</a></h2>

<p>Despite the fact that you can usually get a better deal from Amazon then you can from the Crucial store, the advantage of the Crucial store is their help in getting you the right ram. With Amazon (and to an extent some other vendors) you have to know what you are looking for but with Crucial there are numerous ways to find the right ram for your Apple iMac: You can use an Apple memory configurator or you can even download a little program you can run on your iMac that will tell you exactly how much and what type of RAM you need.</p>

<h2 id="owc"><a href="http://www.macsales.com">OWC</a></h2>

<p>Other World Computing needs no introduction to the Apple community and has been selling ram for iMacs since Day One of the first iMac release. OWC offers an easy to navigate site that makes it easy to find the right ram for your iMac and offers help in finding exactly what model of iMac you have as well as installation videos to help you upgrade the iMac ram yourself.</p>

<h2 id="data-memory-systems"><a href="http://www.datamemorysytems.com">Data Memory Systems</a></h2>

<p>Another memory upgrade store that’s been around for a very long time is Data Memory Systems and they offer ram for each and every Apple iMac model too. I find pricing to be very competitive and in most cases this memory upgrade store has some of best prices on iMac RAM at times.</p>

<h2 id="memoryx"><a href="http://www.memoryx.net">MemoryX</a></h2>

<p>Billed as the <strong>World’s Largest Memory Store</strong> MemoryX boasts to have the biggest memory selection and they just might be right. You should have no problem finding a ram upgrade for each and every iMac made – or any other Apple product you might want to add a memory upgrade to.</p>

<p>These are just a few of the best places to buy ram for Apple iMacs – regardless of year made.</p>

  <p>For your Trade-in to qualify for the promotion it must be a working, complete and undamaged Laptop or Macbook up to six years old. Laptops and Macbooks must have a minimum 11.3” display. Your Trade-in must be complete with a working battery and power supply. Please do not return monitors, keyboards or mice.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One interesting thing I noted that was <a href="https://easytradeup.com/us/en/pages/tradeup/trade-ins">according the photos</a> you can even send them a Mac with missing keys.</p>

<p>I’m not sure why you would ever want to do this and switching from a Mac to Windows seems like a bad idea all around and considering the price you can get for a Mac that’s just six years old you’re probably better off selling the Mac on your own and using the funds for your new Windows Machine.</p>
