<p>That’s a question I get asked a lot – probably second after ‘what is the best memory, or what is the cheapest memory. And ramseeker isn’t the easiest to navigate sometimes if you don’t know what type of memory you have I also get asked what ram do I need for my computer? (BTW,  if you need help with your memory upgrades feel free to email me. I’m here to help you with your ram upgrades)</p>

<p>Back to the best RAM brand. There’s two ways you can buy ram: one that will save you the most money or for a little more money you can buy brand name ram which comes with the knowledge that you paid a bit more for your ram but at least it’s a brand name you can trust.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW">Kingston RAM: Best Selling Memory Upgrades</a></strong></p>

<p>This applies to anything, really and not just ram. Even computers are priced this way – you can buy an Apple Computer  (and pay for the privilege) or you can buy a lesser bran  name.  Once I needed a PC to run some windows program so I found the  cheapest laptop I could find. It worked great for the price but support was non-exisitent as when I needed help with my PC (it was a windows machine. it’s only a matter of time before you need help) the company was long out of business. It was a no-name laptop and I got no-name support to match.</p>

<p>With RAM though you’re better off because even generic memory gets tested to work from the memory vendors before it ships and if you buy ram regardless of brand from the stores I list you won’t have a problem with RAM not working. These stores are all reputable memory vendors and I have mentioned this before.</p>

<p>Some brands you might see are toshiba, samsung, micron (which is crucial), lexar for digital camera ram…just to name a few. It all comes down to your comfort level and what’s most  important to you – getting the cheapest RAM you can buy or spending a  littl more for brand name ram. Your budget and memory needs  all come into play when you need to buy memory – brand name or generic, the choice is ultimately up to you.</p>

<p>So you want to know the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/pc/index.php#lowest" title="cheapest pc ram">cheapest ram right now</a>?</p>

<p>Before I can answer that we need a bit of information before I can begin to help you. Do you have a mac or pc? Are you looking for ram for your digital camera? how about a memory stick?</p>

<p>What size of RAM can your mac/pc/digital camera take?</p>

<p>What type of memory can your mac/pc/digital camera use?</p>

<p>We’re not done yet.  Do you have a memory or ram budget? You’re in the market for the cheapest RAM and you’re definitely at the right place but I want you to understand that price – and this is for any thing, not just ram – is only part of the package deal when shopping for RAM and Memory Upgrades</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00200K1SY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00200K1SY"><img title="Cheapest Camera RAM" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-3.43.05-PM.png" alt="Cheap RAM for Digital Cameras" width="290" height="314" /></a></p>

<p>Do you care if the ram is name brand ram or are you happy with generic ram? How about used ram? That actually would be the cheapest ram, but it’s used and  any savings you might acquire buy shopping for used ram could be eaten up by support costs and other habits. You can sell your old ram too and that would make your new ram even cheaper or at very least – offset the costs of  ram when you are ready to buy new ram.</p>

<p>How about a gurantee? do you need one?  What if by chance, the ram goes bad. Do you want or need a 1-800 phone number to call? Are you OK with email support? Are you a whiz kid who knows all there ever needs to know about ram and memory and you’re just in the market for the lowest price ram and you don’t care about support for your ram purchase.</p>

<p>These are all things to consider when  you need to buy ram and you are in the need for cheapest ram. The cheapest ram for an older notebook for blogging means a whole other thing if you’re looking to upgrade hundreds of computers at the same time. Saving a few dollars in ram in this case might not be worth it.</p>

<p>How are you going  to pay for the ram . Visa, mastercard?  Paypal? <a href="http://www.canadianonlinebanking.com" title="canadian online banking">wire the money</a> to the vendor? Purchase Order? All of these different payment offer differernt fee structures and payment terms. For the hobbyist a credit card works best probably. For the commercial order you’re probably want to go with a store that will accept your PO. so  you can cross the ‘upgrade office computers’ task off your to do list.</p>

<p>Once you’ve decided  on all these options and probably a few I haven’t even thought of then I can help you<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="buy the cheapest ram"> buy the cheapest RAM </a>for the right price with the right features you need for your application.</p>

   <B> <h1><a href="/2010/08/macbook-pro-memory-upgrade/">MacBook Pro Memory Upgrade</a></h1></B>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>As desktop computers become more and more obsolete and notebook computers more and more powerful, especially in the case of Apple Computer and their notebooks that offer processing speed and performance unheard of only a few short years ago more and more Apple customers new and old are looking to upgrade their MacBook Pros with a</p>

<p>I mean ram upgrades for MacBook Pros, not hard drive upgrades for MacBook Pros although those are a good idea with larger hard drives for MacBook Pros being available and newer SSD technology maturing where you get even faster performance out of your MacBook Pro than you ever could with a traditional hard drive.</p>

<p>But for today I mean ram upgrades for your macbook pro. Just a few short years ago, heck even one year ago MacBook Pro RAM or Memory – especially the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_Pro_KITS_(1066_DDR3)-8gb/" title="8GB MacBook Pro RAM">8GB Macbook Pro RAM</a> would set you back a pretty penny, with costs for ram hovering about $1000 to max out your MBP.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_Pro_(1066_DDR3)/" title="macbook pro memory upgrade">MacBook Pro Memory Upgrade</a></strong><br />
[table id=1 /]<br />

<p><strong><a href="&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I">Best MacBook Pro Prices</a></strong></p>

<p>But over time the bigger ram chips or modules get cheaper and cheaper and now 8GB Memory Upgrade Kits aren’t priced too high. OK, they’re still pretty expensive when you compare them to<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_Pro_KITS_(1066_DDR3)-4gb/" title="4GB ram for macbook pro "> 4GB RAM for MacBook Pros</a> and I bet there’s more fun ways to spend your money like on a new iPhone or iPad but for just a few hundered dollars you can achieve maximum performance and speed from your professional macbook from Apple.</p>

<p>And why not upgrade the ram on your MacBook Pro? You already forked over $2000 or more to buy the macbook pro so what’s a few hundred more? In fact, some memory stores will offer you credit for your old MacBook Pro RAM which makes your MacBook Pro memory upgrade even cheaper.</p>

<p>Let’s assume you manage to get $50 for your old ram.  (This is just a guess). As I write this MacBook Pro 8GB Memory Upgrade Kits go for about $250 online. For $200, or less than 1/10th of what you paid for your MacBook Pro in the first place you could be rockin’ it with a MacBook Pro running at full speed. No more annoying  apple multi-colored wheel or progress bar while you wait for your Mac to catch up. This is especially important for processor intensive tasks such as iMovie or Photoshop users.</p>

<p>It always amuses me when I get people looking for the best deal on ram for macbook or the cheapest macbook pro ram. It’s my opinion that a MacBook Pro Memory Upgrade is worth it at any cost with today’s ram prices.</p>

<p>With the latest and greatest new MacBook Pro models released by Apple earlier this spring (2010) one of the best features in my opinion was that the new Apple MacBook Pros could now be fitted with 8GB of RAM, DDR3 1066 RAM specifically made for the Apple MacBook Pros.</p>

<p>[table id=8 /]</p>

<p>I’ve been listing the DDR3 ram for MacBook and MacBook Pro for quite some time now,  but it’s only  been since oh, April 2010 that the 8GB RAM for Apple MacBook Pros really became to be in demand and popular. You probably found this page by searching for macbook pro ram or ram for macbook pro or ddr3 ram or 8gb ddr3 and I won’t disappoint you: you can find the<strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="best price macbook pro 8gb ram"> best price on  MacBook Pro 8GB DDR3 RAM.</a></strong></p>

<div>
</div>

<p>On the page where I list the 8GB MacBook Pro RAM you’ll be looking at MacBook Memory upgrades that are marketed as memory upgrade kits but you shouldn’t dismiss the fact that you might be able to get a better price on MacBook Pro ram by searching for 2x4GB memory upgrades and doing the math yourself.</p>

<p>The memory stores that are online  and carry MacBook Pro RAM are different for each and every one of them as some memory shops prefer to list the MacBook Pro memory  as individual module as it makes it easier for them to list the ram prices individually regardless of what you need – even if you need to install the ram in matched pairs.</p>

<p>Other stores are a bit more savvy with the marketing so they market memory as kits which could result in a higher sale per order. If they can sell you two memory modules instead of one they will. There’s nothing wrong with memory shops trying to increase their memory sales, just like there’s no problem with you wanting to get the best deal you can on MacBook Pro RAM.</p>

<p>And you can get the best deal on ram but you should check both the <a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-1548159-10273954?url=http://www.crucial.com/store/affiliateredirect.asp?imodule=CT51264BC1067&amp;aid=1027395&amp;cid=777292&amp;subid=89&amp;PRS&amp;uscj&amp;cjsku=CT51264BC1067">4GB memory modules for MacBook Pro</a> in addition to the <a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-1548159-10273954?url=http://www.crucial.com/store/affiliateredirect.asp?imodule=CT2KIT51264BC1067&amp;aid=1027395&amp;cid=777292&amp;subid=89&amp;PRS&amp;uscj&amp;cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1067">MacBook Pro 8GB memory kits</a> as there’s a chance one or the other might be the better memory deal for you. ram prices change over time sometimes a memory vendor selling macbook pro memory upgrade kits will have the better deal and some times its memory modules end up being the better ram deal.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013FK9U2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0013FK9U2">Cheapest Apple Mac </a></strong></p>

<p>Well, it can be expensive or pricey for memory but that just means you’re not shopping hard enough for the best deal on ram, or if you prefer: inexpensive mac memory, or cheap memory for your mac.</p>

<p>The good news is you’re at the right place to get a fair deal on high quality memory upgrades. I’ve been confused in the past as an online store that sells memory but I leave that to the memory professionals such as 18004Mememory, Memory X, OEMPCWORLD, RAMJET, Data Memory Systems, OWC, Crucial Technology  and a few other memory stores that either specialize in Apple memory or memory for your macs for much less than what you might pay from name brand memory stores such as directly from Apple.</p>

<p>If you’re looking for cheap ram from Apple directly you’ll be looking long and hard to fin  some. They do sell ram but it’s expensive: 8GB for MacBook Pro will set you back $600 as opposed to much much less – about half price – when you buy ram from the memory stores I do list.</p>

<p>At one point I used to offer a much longer list of memory stores that sold RAM but they haven’t been in business for decades or even longer. I think OWC has been helping Apple users get a good deal on upgrades since ’88. That’s a long time to be in business and you don’t accomplish that by under selling at the lowest ram price. You get to 25 years in business by supporting the Apple community and making sure you offer a competitive product at a competetive price and that’s what I specialize in: tracking and monitoring ram prices from the memory stores that have been around for some time and offer great deals and more importantly – great support on the products they sell.</p>

<p>Even yours truly has 13 years tracking ram prices so I know a good deal on ram when I see it ( ram just gets cheaper and cheaper year after year) Buy good ram that’s cheap or <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="inexpensive mac ram">inexpensive mac memory </a>from a memory store you can trust and  you will have problem  free computing regardless  what apple computer you have and need to upgrade</p>

<p>Too much.</p>

<p>And that’s how ramseeker was born. I searched and found lots of other memory stores online that offer guranteed memory to fun just fine in your MacBook Pro for much much less than what the RAM costs when buy it directly from Apple.</p>

<p>As I write this it costs <a href="http://store.apple.com/us/memorymodel/ME_17_266_MBP_ICI7" title="8gb macbook pro ram ">$600 for an 8GB memory upgrade kit from the apple store</a> today.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>[table id=1 /]</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-3.48.40-PM.png"><img title="Cheap MacBook Pro RAM" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-3.48.40-PM.png" alt="Best MacBook Pro Memory" width="313" height="293" /></a></p>

<p>Compare that to about $250 for the same RAM from a selection of memory stores that have been in business for at very least a decade if not longer and offer a gaurantee on all ram they sell. That’s fair savings for about ten minutes effort searching online for the best price macbook pro ram, no? If the difference were closer I might even argue ordering that you buy your ram directly from Apple as you have to hand it to Apple, they do support the products they sell. At least in the very few times I have had problems with any Apple products they usually take care of it if the macbook or anything is under warranty.</p>

<p>And you know what will happen if you do have trouble with your ram from third party memory suppliers?  It’s a good guess Apple will blame  the ‘bad ram’ . There was a thing oh, it must be a decade  now where  Apple tweaked the OS a bit and a lot of users were having problems with  their ram not being recognized.  This was kind of a big deal in the Mac web so I got on the phone and called every one of these memory stores I list and every store told me they would replace the ram if their memory was at fault.</p>

<p>When you buy Apple RAM you do get the satisfaction of knowing in the event of something going wrong you’ve got Apple RAM in an Apple Computer and reciepts to back it up making for an easy life in the event you may have trouble.</p>

<p>But I don’t know… that’s a pretty big price premium for MacBook RAM. I guess the question is for you to decide if the price to pay apple for ‘apple’ ram . (which in my personal  macbook was just crucial memory anyway). I vote no. I’m all for getting the most value out of my hard earned money and every store I list memory prices from is reputable and sells MacBook 8GB for much less than what the Apple Store does and yet still offers excellent service and prices.  You can buy 8GB from Apple but it’ll cost you for the privilege. There’s much <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_Pro_KITS_(1066_DDR3)-8gb/" title="cheap macbook pro 8gb ram">cheaper 8GB MacBook Pro RAM</a> available and that’s what I recommend.</p>

<p>What’s the** **<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="best ram for mac mini"><strong>best ram for mac mini</strong></a>?. That’s a question I get and have to answer a lot here so I thought I’d write this to help you when you need to decide on buying mac mini ram.</p>

<p>With the release of the new Apple Mac Mini, Apple’s offering a very powerful computer that’s tiny but if you’ve already have a keyboard and mouse and monitor you can save some money and  just buy a mac mini. Lots of buyers of the mac mini also are using these small apple computers as media servers as more and more entertainment is available to buy online.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-3.56.25-PM.png"><img title="Mac Mini Deals" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-3.56.25-PM.png" alt="Best Price on Mac Mini" width="491" height="216" /></a></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013FK9U2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0013FK9U2">Best Price on Mac Mini</a></strong></p>

<p>Anyway, the <strong>RAM for Apple Mac Mini</strong></p>

<p>If you have the original mac mini that uses PC2700 RAM you might be better off upgrading the mac mini to a newer mac mini model as these tiny macs,while small are getting a wee bit dated and adding RAM may or may not be the best deal depending on how you plan on using the mac mini.</p>

<p>That said, I’ll let you decide and you here’s where you can <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/Mac_mini/" title="best mac mini PC2700">buy the best price on ram for the older mac minis that used the PC2700 so-dimms </a>from a few years back now.</p>

<p>Next up, are the intel core duo and intel core 2 duo mac minis. These are a much better deal and until a month or so ago were the most current mac mini you could buy. These mac minis use the much more technologicially advanced so-dimms that are DDR2 PC5300. The intel core 2 duo <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/Mac_Mini_(PC_5300)/" title="fill a mac mini with ram">mac minis full of ram </a>are a great deal if you can find one for cheap. Tecnically apple states that you should have a ‘apple authorized’ service center install ram on this (and all mac minis, unless they have changed this)  but it doesn’t take long and you can do it yourself easily enough. Chances are if you’re looking to upgrade an intel core 2 duo mac mini the warranty is gone anyway (unless you have applecare).  Best prices for Mac Mini PC5300 DDR sodimms are right here.</p>

<p>Lastly, the new Mac Minis. I’ve written above how these are a great deal so I’ll spare you  but the big deal in my mind is that you can now <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/Mac_Mini_KITS_(1066_DDR3)/" title="fill a mac mini with 8GB of ram">fill a mac mini with 8GB of RAM</a> (4gbx2) if you choose, just like the macbooks – it’s the same ram for Mac Minis. Until recently the  most ram you could install in a Mac Mini was 4GB. Not anymore – with 8GB of ram or memory the new Mac Mini is a powerful and versatile apple computer and also the <strong>cheapest mac you can buy.</strong></p>

<p>Let’s get this cleared up right away, whatever the price – whether it’s the lowest price or the highest price it doesn’t really matter: <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="memory and ram">Memory and RAM</a> are the same thing and can be used or interchanged when talking about upgrades for your computer. RAM is an acronym for random access memory. See? the RAM name even has the word memory in the description.</p>

<p>But enough about that. What about the prices you say ?  You want memory prices (or ram prices) and that is why you’re here. You plunked some terms into google or bing or MSN or whatever search engine and you’ve landed here looking for (I’m going to guess here) the best ram prices for you computer.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW"><img title="Best Apple Memory Upgrade" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-4.04.05-PM.png" alt="Best RAM Upgrade" width="531" height="274" /></a></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW">Apple RAM</a></strong></p>

<p>Congratulations! You’re here. At ramseeker all I do is track ram and memory prices from online stores you can trust (there was a time I would track prices from everybody, but oh boy the complaints).  Yes I said trust.</p>

<p>You’ve seen  the ‘lifetime guarantee’ stickers on the websites if you have been shopping for ram for any length of time. My first response to these guarantees is to ask ‘who’s lifetime?’  – mine or the store getting my money.</p>

<p>Well, let me tell you about all the memory stores on ramseeker. Every one has been in business selling and supporting nothing but memory (well, that’s a lie – a few sell hard drives and others stuff too)  and they have been in business for at very least: 10 years, most closer to 15 years and then in some cases over twenty years of experience selling ram at the best fair price they can, that is made and manufactured to exact specifications supplied by the manufacturer.</p>

<p>You really can’t go wrong regardless of  what memory price you choose if you stick  to my list of approved memory stores. In fact if the small chance you do buy memory from any one of the memory vendors I list on ramseeker and you do have a problem. ( I can remember 1 time in 13 years,  I think) I’ll help you to try and get it sorted out.</p>

<p>But that won’t happen if you use a memory store I list. The same can’t be said if you end up on eBay or craigslist and you buy some crappy memory from somebody somewhere else. If you buy cheap ram elsewhere that’s great but ask yourself how long they’ve been in business. I make my living with my computer. My time is money and I want to install the ram I can find at the best price and forget about ram and memory prices until I need to buy more ram.  I suggest you do the same and save yourself  a world of troubleshooting. Buy quality memory from quality ram stores and be happy with your purchase.  Yes it’s that easy to get the best memory price and be happy with your ram.</p>

		<div class="post-content"><p> <br />
That’s great that you need the best ram upgrade for iMac but the very first thing we need to do is figure out which apple iMac you use. Maybe you already know this as some apple  fans and websites have a lot of knowledge about all the different types of iMacs and not just ram so if you’ve come with the knowledge of what ram you need for your particular iMac feel free to skip ahead and start to <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="shop for iMac Memory">shop for iMac Memory now</a>.<br />
I track and monitor memory prices on a whole bunch of different iMacs over the years and Apple has this annoying  habit of just calling the iMac ‘iMac’ regardless of year or design. They’re all just iMacs according to Apple and the latest is the ‘iMac’ model that was just released. This has been called different names to differentiate between the older models. I have seen the new iMac as iMac Summer 2010 or iMac mid July or if you’re me I classify the Apple iMacs by ram types they use.If you’re looking for the <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="best ram upgrade for iMac">best ram upgrade for iMac </a></strong>you’ve definitely come to the right place.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8IO6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8IO6">Best Apple iMac Prices</a></strong></p>

<p>But for the rest of us: a little lesson on how to find out what  iMac you have, or at very least I want to help you figure out what RAM you need for iMacs. Here’s how and this technique will work not only with iMacs but with  MacBooks or any other apple computer too.</p>

<p>Go to your apple menu in the left hand corner.</p>

<p>Select: About this Mac</p>

<p>Up comes a window that tells you how much RAM you have and how to see what RAM  you need.</p>

<p>Here’s mine: It’s a MacBook. I know this because apple has screen printed it right on the screen for me to see – nice and handy.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>It will show the processor speed. This is good and in my case I have a MacBook Pro 2.4Ghz. I’ll write this down.</p>

<p>Then I see I have 4GB of RAM installed already (which is the maximum already). And this ram runs at 1067mhz., which is real close to the 1066Mhz RAM I need to buy ( apple rounds up the speed of the memory. My macbook pro ram runs at 1066.6 Mhz , so apple calls it close enough to 1067MHz)</p>

<p>In my case I know know I have a MacBook Pro 2.4GHz and it runs at 1066Mhz, so if I were to shop for ram for my macbook  I would want to buy MacBook Pro 1066Mhz RAM</p>

<p>And that’s all there is to it to find out how much ram  you have. If you need help figuring any of this out be sure to contact me and I’ll be happy to help you get the best RAM upgrade for your iMac or any computer.</p>

   <B> <h1><a href="/2010/08/4gb-ram-for-black-macbook/">4GB RAM for Black MacBook</a></h1></B>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001265GI2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001265GI2">Cheap MacBook Memory</a></strong></p>

<p>It depends on which particular black macbook you have but you may be able to install up  to 6gb of RAM inside a black macbook. You would do this by installing one 4GB memory chip into one memory slot while with the other memory upgrade slot you install a 2 gb memory module.</p>

<p>The black MacBooks either max out at 2 GB of RAM or 4GB of Memory depending on what model you have. The later Apple MacBooks will run up to 6GB of memory unofficially, meaning that it’s not supported or documented by apple and some of the earlier models will recognize 3GB of RAM.</p>

<p>Personally, I don’t think it’s worth the bother to upgrade your Black MacBooks past what is recommended by Apple as I think you’re just asking for trouble. Just because you can, doesn’t mean you should.</p>

<p>The intel core duo black macbooks released in 2006 will max out at 2GB of  PC5300 DDR2 RAM.  You will need to buy <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_(PC5300_DDR)-1gb/" title="black macbook 1GB RAM">2x1GB PC5300 DDR sodimms </a>to get the maximum RAM  for this black macbook model</p>

<p>The intel core 2 duo <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_(PC5300_DDR)-1gb/" title="2gb ram black macbooks">black macbook models also max out with 2GB of RAM </a>and the same  memory configuration is required: 2x1GB PC5300 DDR sodimms are needed to get the maximum ram</p>

<p>The intel core 2 duo black macbooks with the ‘santa rosa’ processor will take more ram than the 2GB of predecessors and will recognize <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_(PC5300_DDR)-2gb/" title="black macbook 4GB RAM">4GB of ram by installing  2x2GB PC53000 DDR so-dimms. </a></p>

<p>the 2008 intel core 2 duo black macbook will also take 4GB by replacing the standard memory that came from the factory with<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_(PC5300_DDR)-2gb/" title="2x2GB for black macbooks"> 2x2GB 4GB memory upgrades for black macbook </a></p>

<p>So yes, you could squeeze either 3GB or 6GB into your black macbook depending on what particular black macbook model you have but it’s not something I can recommend. Some trusted memory vendors (OWC comes to mind) say that the larger memory will work just fine with the dark colored apple notebooks but I can’t recommend it and sleep at night.</p>

<p>But for the later black macbooks there’s no reason why you can’t<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="4gb ram for black macbooks"> install 4GB RAM for Black MacBook</a> and rest assured your black macbooks will run just fine with the ram maxed out at 4GB.</p>
