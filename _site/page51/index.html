<p><strong>Buy RAM for iMac.</strong> Do it. If you have an Apple iMac (or are considering buying an Apple iMac) you should fill that sucker with RAM.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8IO6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8IO6"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1316" title="Cheapest Apple iMacs" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-3.28.35-PM.png" alt="Best Deal on Apple iMacs" width="297" height="273" /></a></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8IO6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8IO6">Best Apple iMac</a></strong></p>

<p>I’ll tell you why, too. I’m going to guess that you bought that Apple iMac for the looks, the simplicity even maybe because it was the best deal on an Apple iMac you could get and you couldn’t pass on such a great Apple iMac Deal. Whatever your iMac buying reasons, there’s one thing you want it to do: run without problems.</p>

<p>More RAM for iMac does this. It allows your Apple iMac to breathe, if you will. All the technical mumbo-jumbo aside when you buy more ram for you iMac (and install it yourself, it’s easy) you give a fresh blast of fresh air to your computer. Ever been in a small space, say like an elevator and it’s just a little too…close? The iMac feels the same way when it’s running the numbers for you and massaging all that data for you so you can surf facebook or even make money with your iMac (if you’re using your iMac to make money than the argument for adding more iMac RAM just increased ten fold) . Your iMac need some space. We’re talking working space here. RAM for you iMac is like buying a bigger house. All of sudden you’ve got a bigger place and your iMac can run free and do all that heavy computing for you – all because you bought iMac RAM.</p>

<p>**Where to Buy RAM for iMac?<br />
**</p>

<p>[table id=2 /]</p>

<p>Yes, you can buy ram for iMac from Apple – and you may think that this is the best solution – they made the computer, right? So of course all the geniuses at the Apple store can help you with ram upgrades – and they can. You can order ram for the iMac online too and you can get it from the Apple Store. The problem when you buy ram from apple directly is hoo boy is it pricey.<br />
You do get the excellent apple support and at one time, there was actually apple ram and windows ram but not any more – as long as RAM for your iMac meets the apple specifications, you can buy iMac RAM a lot cheaper from more than one memory store.</p>

<p>As luck would have it, I have made a list of all the places you can buy ram for iMac. There’s lots more stores than the memory stores I list of course, but all the memory stores I list I can recommend. In fact, most memory stores have been selling ram for iMacs since the very first iMac with that funky teal color and round mouse and for that you get piece of mind knowing you can buy iMac ram for less but it’s still guaranteed to work in your iMac without trouble. And in the slight chance that there is a problem with your <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/iMac_KITS_(DDR3_1333)/">RAM for iMac,</a> these stores will work with you to sort out any ram problems you might have with your iMac RAM.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com">Buy iMac RAM for less</a>, and you’ll work faster and your iMac will run smoother too.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_Pro_KITS_(1066_DDR3)/">best MacBook Pro RAM</a> is best price you can get for MacBook Pro Memory.</p>

<p>You might prefer to <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com">order RAM</a> directly from Apple. Yes, it’s expensive for what it is (you’re more than halfway to a new macbook). But you do get great support from Apple in the slight chance that something goes wrong. For no other reason Apple won’t be able to give you a hard time for non-apple memory if you have MacBook Pro problems down the road (hey, it’s possible). Apple won’t be able to give you the run around about not using apple memory and might blame the bad ram on the third party ram.</p>

<p>But I know a better way to get the best MacBook Pro RAM and it sure doesn’t include Apple. In fact, I’ve got a handy-dandy price lis of all ram for macbook pros from very reputable online memory stores that appreciate and respect the Apple user and customer. In the past the list used to be longer but after a while I got tired of all the complaints about certain online stores (you know who you are) so I’ve settled on this bunch of memory stores to list MacBook Pro RAM prices as they offer fair prices on MacBook Pro memory and in the small chance you do have problems with your MacBook ram, they will be there for you just like Apple will but at least they’ll be a lot cheaper than apple memory.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW"><img title="Best MacBook Pro RAM" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-3.25.50-PM.png" alt="Cheapest MacBook Pro RAM" width="309" height="208" /></a></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW">Best MacBook Pro RAM</a></strong></p>

<p>DDR3 1066 for MacBook Pro is the memory type you want and if you’ve got a Spring 2010 MacBook Pro (or some older MBP’s too) you can upgrade to the maximum of 8GB of RAM and I suggest you do to get the most out of your MacBook Pro. You spent a good dollar on your MacBook Pro to get the fancy extra firewire, faster processor, light up keyboard and a bunch of other features, so it seems silly to me to scrimp on RAM. RAM prices for MacBook Pros have dropped considerably for the 1066 DDR 3 memory and now what you would have paid over$1000 for you can now buy 8GB of RAM for MacBook Pros for less – about $250 as I write this. That’s about half what you’d pay if you bought from Apple too. There’s nothing wrong with Apple RAM but you pay for it. Even brand name ram like Crucial is loads cheaper for MacBook Pro RAM.</p>

<p>Buy the most RAM you can afford for your MacBook Pro and you won’t regret buying MacBook Pro RAM as your MacBook will be topped up and running at maximum performance too, and that’s the best MacBook Pro RAM – The maximum RAM in your MacBook Pro at an affordable price you are comfortable with when shopping and buying ram for your MacBook Pro.</p>

   <B> <h1><a href="/2010/08/ram-and-memory-for-the-2010-mac-pros/">RAM and Memory for the 2010 Mac Pros</a></h1></B>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>I have as of this morning added memory and ram prices from four memory stores so far that list and sell apple memory for the new Apple Mac Pro models just released:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ZR4M6I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B003ZR4M6I"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1323" title="Best MacBook Pro Deal" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-3.36.15-PM.png" alt="Cheapest MacBook Pro" width="210" height="273" /></a></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ZR4M6I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B003ZR4M6I">Cheapest Apple Mac Pro</a></strong></p>

<p>These are for the Mac Pros that now require 1333MHz  RAM. The 1066Mhz memory is still a current model as now any Mac Pro you buy could take two different types of RAM depending on what 2010 Mac Pro you buy and want to upgrade the memory for:</p>

<p>The 2.4GHz Apple Mac Pro still use the same 1066Mhz DDR SDRAM DIMMS that previous models use. My guess is that Apple will discontinue this Mac Pro model sooner or later once the faster memory and processors get cheaper. (they always do)</p>

<p>The 2.66GHz and 2.93GHz Apple Mac Pro models is where the new 1333Mhz RAM applies and now you’ve got a slew of selections to choose depending on what Mac Pro you have and how much memory you want to install in them.</p>

<p>As always I have added two different methods you can shop for memory: by looking for prices on individual<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/Mac_Pro_DDR3_1333/" title="mac pro memory modules"> Mac Pro memory modules </a>or by shopping for ram as a package deal and buying it in a memory upgrade kits. The new Mac Pros offer 8 slots for memory upgrades and depending on how badly you need the performance you can fill your Mac Pro with up to 64GB of RAM now. It won’t be cheap but it’s possible.</p>

<p>You now have three different options for shopping for Mac Pro Memory and  RAM upgrade kits:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/Mac_Pro_RAM_Upgrade_Kits_DDR3_1333_with_2GB_RAM/" title="Mac Pro  1333Mhz ram upgrade kits with 2gb ram modules">Mac Pro Memory Upgrade Kits with 2GB 1333MHz ram modules</a></p>

<p>Depending on your Mac Pro memory needs or budget you can buy Mac Pro RAM upgrades in every configuration  imagineable from 4GB all the way to 64GB of ram for Mac Pro.</p>

<p>The new MacBook Pros from Apple come standard with  4GB installed as default.  Some of the older MacBooks can also accept a maximum of 4GB and until just recently – as in a month ago – 4GB was the maximum in most MacBook Pros on sale by Apple.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW"><img class="size-full wp-image-1314 alignleft" title="Best MacBook Pro RAM" alt="Cheapest MacBook Pro RAM" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-3.25.50-PM.png" width="309" height="208" /></a></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW">8GB MacBook Pro RAM under $100</a></strong></p>

<p>To answer your question? It depends.</p>

<p>[table id=15 /]</p>

<p>I know it sounds kind of vague so let me explain: I’ve got a text document open and so it takes some RAM to run Mac OS and  a wee bit more to launch and keep open the application  (and a few other application  I have open like Mail and Safari ).</p>

<p>And then my Mac waits. for me. Even if I could fill my MacBook Pro with 64GB of RAM my mac’s still going to be waiting for me to type another letter or character. I type about 40 words per minute and let me tell you the speed of the RAM is much faster than that.</p>

<p>But let’s say I then go out and record a full HD movie at the biggest full high definition resolution and download that video to my computer so I can share with my friends the great time I had at the beach or dinner or whatever..I made a movie and I want to share it.</p>

<p>But first I want to edit the movie and take out the part where I dropped the camera in the sand and then there was the part in the movie where I was just loading the car so I don’t want my friends to see all the junk I have in my trunk. I also want to make some cool little  titles  and fades and other stuff in iMovie so  at the end of the movie my friends say “wow that’s a great movie”.  To do all that is going to take a whole lot more ram than the stock ram configuration that comes with the MacBook Pro. And even if I could do all my movie editing with the current ram – more ram can’t hurt. Moving those pixels around whether it’s still or video takes a whole  lot more processing power and memory than the stock configuration of MacBook Pro.</p>

<p>Also there’s the saying, and I’m sure you’ve heard it: You can never have enough ram or hard drive space. I’ve never regretted buying RAM. Even if it’s been too much at the time of purchase. RAM is cheap. You can fill  up your MacBook Pro for about $200 and this  is much cheaper than some software like Photoshop or Lightroom even.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_Pro_(1066_DDR3)-4gb/" title="4gb ram macbook pro">4GB for the MacBook Pros </a>will do just fine for facebook, email and light computing such as word processing. When you get into the processor intensive stuff like photo editing or movie editing  – buy all the RAM you can afford.</p>

<p>That’s a question I get asked a lot – probably second after ‘what is the best memory, or what is the cheapest memory. And ramseeker isn’t the easiest to navigate sometimes if you don’t know what type of memory you have I also get asked what ram do I need for my computer? (BTW,  if you need help with your memory upgrades feel free to email me. I’m here to help you with your ram upgrades)</p>

<p>Back to the best RAM brand. There’s two ways you can buy ram: one that will save you the most money or for a little more money you can buy brand name ram which comes with the knowledge that you paid a bit more for your ram but at least it’s a brand name you can trust.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>[table id=7 /]</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW"><img title="Best Selling RAM" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-3.30.51-PM.png" alt="Cheap Kingston RAM" width="307" height="184" /></a></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW">Kingston RAM: Best Selling Memory Upgrades</a></strong></p>

<p>This applies to anything, really and not just ram. Even computers are priced this way – you can buy an Apple Computer  (and pay for the privilege) or you can buy a lesser bran  name.  Once I needed a PC to run some windows program so I found the  cheapest laptop I could find. It worked great for the price but support was non-exisitent as when I needed help with my PC (it was a windows machine. it’s only a matter of time before you need help) the company was long out of business. It was a no-name laptop and I got no-name support to match.</p>

<p>With RAM though you’re better off because even generic memory gets tested to work from the memory vendors before it ships and if you buy ram regardless of brand from the stores I list you won’t have a problem with RAM not working. These stores are all reputable memory vendors and I have mentioned this before.</p>

<p>Some brands you might see are toshiba, samsung, micron (which is crucial), lexar for digital camera ram…just to name a few. It all comes down to your comfort level and what’s most  important to you – getting the cheapest RAM you can buy or spending a  littl more for brand name ram. Your budget and memory needs  all come into play when you need to buy memory – brand name or generic, the choice is ultimately up to you.</p>

<p>So you want to know the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/pc/index.php#lowest" title="cheapest pc ram">cheapest ram right now</a>?</p>

<p>Before I can answer that we need a bit of information before I can begin to help you. Do you have a mac or pc? Are you looking for ram for your digital camera? how about a memory stick?</p>

<p>What size of RAM can your mac/pc/digital camera take?</p>

<p>What type of memory can your mac/pc/digital camera use?</p>

<p>We’re not done yet.  Do you have a memory or ram budget? You’re in the market for the cheapest RAM and you’re definitely at the right place but I want you to understand that price – and this is for any thing, not just ram – is only part of the package deal when shopping for RAM and Memory Upgrades</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00200K1SY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00200K1SY"><img title="Cheapest Camera RAM" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-3.43.05-PM.png" alt="Cheap RAM for Digital Cameras" width="290" height="314" /></a></p>

<p>Do you care if the ram is name brand ram or are you happy with generic ram? How about used ram? That actually would be the cheapest ram, but it’s used and  any savings you might acquire buy shopping for used ram could be eaten up by support costs and other habits. You can sell your old ram too and that would make your new ram even cheaper or at very least – offset the costs of  ram when you are ready to buy new ram.</p>

<p>How about a gurantee? do you need one?  What if by chance, the ram goes bad. Do you want or need a 1-800 phone number to call? Are you OK with email support? Are you a whiz kid who knows all there ever needs to know about ram and memory and you’re just in the market for the lowest price ram and you don’t care about support for your ram purchase.</p>

<p>These are all things to consider when  you need to buy ram and you are in the need for cheapest ram. The cheapest ram for an older notebook for blogging means a whole other thing if you’re looking to upgrade hundreds of computers at the same time. Saving a few dollars in ram in this case might not be worth it.</p>

<p>How are you going  to pay for the ram . Visa, mastercard?  Paypal? <a href="http://www.canadianonlinebanking.com" title="canadian online banking">wire the money</a> to the vendor? Purchase Order? All of these different payment offer differernt fee structures and payment terms. For the hobbyist a credit card works best probably. For the commercial order you’re probably want to go with a store that will accept your PO. so  you can cross the ‘upgrade office computers’ task off your to do list.</p>

<p>Once you’ve decided  on all these options and probably a few I haven’t even thought of then I can help you<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="buy the cheapest ram"> buy the cheapest RAM </a>for the right price with the right features you need for your application.</p>

OK, they’re still pretty expensive when you compare them to<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_Pro_KITS_(1066_DDR3)-4gb/" title="4GB ram for macbook pro "> 4GB RAM for MacBook Pros</a> and I bet there’s more fun ways to spend your money like on a new iPhone or iPad but for just a few hundered dollars you can achieve maximum performance and speed from your professional macbook from Apple.</p>

<p>And why not upgrade the ram on your MacBook Pro? You already forked over $2000 or more to buy the macbook pro so what’s a few hundred more? In fact, some memory stores will offer you credit for your old MacBook Pro RAM which makes your MacBook Pro memory upgrade even cheaper.</p>

<p>Let’s assume you manage to get $50 for your old ram.  (This is just a guess). As I write this MacBook Pro 8GB Memory Upgrade Kits go for about $250 online. For $200, or less than 1/10th of what you paid for your MacBook Pro in the first place you could be rockin’ it with a MacBook Pro running at full speed. No more annoying  apple multi-colored wheel or progress bar while you wait for your Mac to catch up. This is especially important for processor intensive tasks such as iMovie or Photoshop users.</p>

<p>It always amuses me when I get people looking for the best deal on ram for macbook or the cheapest macbook pro ram. It’s my opinion that a MacBook Pro Memory Upgrade is worth it at any cost with today’s ram prices.</p>

<p>With the latest and greatest new MacBook Pro models released by Apple earlier this spring (2010) one of the best features in my opinion was that the new Apple MacBook Pros could now be fitted with 8GB of RAM, DDR3 1066 RAM specifically made for the Apple MacBook Pros.</p>

<p>[table id=8 /]</p>

<p>I’ve been listing the DDR3 ram for MacBook and MacBook Pro for quite some time now,  but it’s only  been since oh, April 2010 that the 8GB RAM for Apple MacBook Pros really became to be in demand and popular. You probably found this page by searching for macbook pro ram or ram for macbook pro or ddr3 ram or 8gb ddr3 and I won’t disappoint you: you can find the<strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="best price macbook pro 8gb ram"> best price on  MacBook Pro 8GB DDR3 RAM.</a></strong></p>

<p>On the page where I list the 8GB MacBook Pro RAM you’ll be looking at MacBook Memory upgrades that are marketed as memory upgrade kits but you shouldn’t dismiss the fact that you might be able to get a better price on MacBook Pro ram by searching for 2x4GB memory upgrades and doing the math yourself.</p>

<p>The memory stores that are online  and carry MacBook Pro RAM are different for each and every one of them as some memory shops prefer to list the MacBook Pro memory  as individual module as it makes it easier for them to list the ram prices individually regardless of what you need – even if you need to install the ram in matched pairs.</p>

<p>Other stores are a bit more savvy with the marketing so they market memory as kits which could result in a higher sale per order. If they can sell you two memory modules instead of one they will. There’s nothing wrong with memory shops trying to increase their memory sales, just like there’s no problem with you wanting to get the best deal you can on MacBook Pro RAM.</p>

<p>And you can get the best deal on ram but you should check both the <a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-1548159-10273954?url=http://www.crucial.com/store/affiliateredirect.asp?imodule=CT51264BC1067&amp;aid=1027395&amp;cid=777292&amp;subid=89&amp;PRS&amp;uscj&amp;cjsku=CT51264BC1067">4GB memory modules for MacBook Pro</a> in addition to the <a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-1548159-10273954?url=http://www.crucial.com/store/affiliateredirect.asp?imodule=CT2KIT51264BC1067&amp;aid=1027395&amp;cid=777292&amp;subid=89&amp;PRS&amp;uscj&amp;cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1067">MacBook Pro 8GB memory kits</a> as there’s a chance one or the other might be the better memory deal for you. ram prices change over time sometimes a memory vendor selling macbook pro memory upgrade kits will have the better deal and some times its memory modules end up being the better ram deal.</p>

<p>Mac Memory doesn’t have to be expensive.</p>

<p>Well, it can be expensive or pricey for memory but that just means you’re not shopping hard enough for the best deal on ram, or if you prefer: inexpensive mac memory, or cheap memory for your mac.</p>

<p>The good news is you’re at the right place to get a fair deal on high quality memory upgrades. I’ve been confused in the past as an online store that sells memory but I leave that to the memory professionals such as 18004Mememory, Memory X, OEMPCWORLD, RAMJET, Data Memory Systems, OWC, Crucial Technology  and a few other memory stores that either specialize in Apple memory or memory for your macs for much less than what you might pay from name brand memory stores such as directly from Apple.</p>

<p>If you’re looking for cheap ram from Apple directly you’ll be looking long and hard to fin  some. They do sell ram but it’s expensive: 8GB for MacBook Pro will set you back $600 as opposed to much much less – about half price – when you buy ram from the memory stores I do list.</p>

<p>At one point I used to offer a much longer list of memory stores that sold RAM but they haven’t been in business for decades or even longer. I think OWC has been helping Apple users get a good deal on upgrades since ’88. That’s a long time to be in business and you don’t accomplish that by under selling at the lowest ram price. You get to 25 years in business by supporting the Apple community and making sure you offer a competitive product at a competetive price and that’s what I specialize in: tracking and monitoring ram prices from the memory stores that have been around for some time and offer great deals and more importantly – great support on the products they sell.</p>

<p>Even yours truly has 13 years tracking ram prices so I know a good deal on ram when I see it ( ram just gets cheaper and cheaper year after year) Buy good ram that’s cheap or <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="inexpensive mac ram">inexpensive mac memory </a>from a memory store you can trust and  you will have problem  free computing regardless  what apple computer you have and need to upgrade</p>

<p>Too much.</p>

<p>And that’s how ramseeker was born. I searched and found lots of other memory stores online that offer guranteed memory to fun just fine in your MacBook Pro for much much less than what the RAM costs when buy it directly from Apple.</p>

<p>As I write this it costs <a href="http://store.apple.com/us/memorymodel/ME_17_266_MBP_ICI7" title="8gb macbook pro ram ">$600 for an 8GB memory upgrade kit from the apple store</a> today.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>[table id=1 /]</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-3.48.40-PM.png"><img title="Cheap MacBook Pro RAM" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-3.48.40-PM.png" alt="Best MacBook Pro Memory" width="313" height="293" /></a></p>

<p>Compare that to about $250 for the same RAM from a selection of memory stores that have been in business for at very least a decade if not longer and offer a gaurantee on all ram they sell. That’s fair savings for about ten minutes effort searching online for the best price macbook pro ram, no? If the difference were closer I might even argue ordering that you buy your ram directly from Apple as you have to hand it to Apple, they do support the products they sell. At least in the very few times I have had problems with any Apple products they usually take care of it if the macbook or anything is under warranty.</p>

<p>And you know what will happen if you do have trouble with your ram from third party memory suppliers?  It’s a good guess Apple will blame  the ‘bad ram’ . There was a thing oh, it must be a decade  now where  Apple tweaked the OS a bit and a lot of users were having problems with  their ram not being recognized.  This was kind of a big deal in the Mac web so I got on the phone and called every one of these memory stores I list and every store told me they would replace the ram if their memory was at fault.</p>

<p>When you buy Apple RAM you do get the satisfaction of knowing in the event of something going wrong you’ve got Apple RAM in an Apple Computer and reciepts to back it up making for an easy life in the event you may have trouble.</p>

<p>But I don’t know… that’s a pretty big price premium for MacBook RAM. I guess the question is for you to decide if the price to pay apple for ‘apple’ ram . (which in my personal  macbook was just crucial memory anyway). I vote no. I’m all for getting the most value out of my hard earned money and every store I list memory prices from is reputable and sells MacBook 8GB for much less than what the Apple Store does and yet still offers excellent service and prices.  You can buy 8GB from Apple but it’ll cost you for the privilege. There’s much <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_Pro_KITS_(1066_DDR3)-8gb/" title="cheap macbook pro 8gb ram">cheaper 8GB MacBook Pro RAM</a> available and that’s what I recommend.</p>
