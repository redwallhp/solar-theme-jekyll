<p>Too much.</p>

<p>And that’s how ramseeker was born. I searched and found lots of other memory stores online that offer guranteed memory to fun just fine in your MacBook Pro for much much less than what the RAM costs when buy it directly from Apple.</p>

<p>As I write this it costs <a href="http://store.apple.com/us/memorymodel/ME_17_266_MBP_ICI7" title="8gb macbook pro ram ">$600 for an 8GB memory upgrade kit from the apple store</a> today.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>[table id=1 /]</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-3.48.40-PM.png"><img title="Cheap MacBook Pro RAM" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-3.48.40-PM.png" alt="Best MacBook Pro Memory" width="313" height="293" /></a></p>

<p>Compare that to about $250 for the same RAM from a selection of memory stores that have been in business for at very least a decade if not longer and offer a gaurantee on all ram they sell. That’s fair savings for about ten minutes effort searching online for the best price macbook pro ram, no? If the difference were closer I might even argue ordering that you buy your ram directly from Apple as you have to hand it to Apple, they do support the products they sell. At least in the very few times I have had problems with any Apple products they usually take care of it if the macbook or anything is under warranty.</p>

<p>And you know what will happen if you do have trouble with your ram from third party memory suppliers?  It’s a good guess Apple will blame  the ‘bad ram’ . There was a thing oh, it must be a decade  now where  Apple tweaked the OS a bit and a lot of users were having problems with  their ram not being recognized.  This was kind of a big deal in the Mac web so I got on the phone and called every one of these memory stores I list and every store told me they would replace the ram if their memory was at fault.</p>

<p>When you buy Apple RAM you do get the satisfaction of knowing in the event of something going wrong you’ve got Apple RAM in an Apple Computer and reciepts to back it up making for an easy life in the event you may have trouble.</p>

<p>But I don’t know… that’s a pretty big price premium for MacBook RAM. I guess the question is for you to decide if the price to pay apple for ‘apple’ ram . (which in my personal  macbook was just crucial memory anyway). I vote no. I’m all for getting the most value out of my hard earned money and every store I list memory prices from is reputable and sells MacBook 8GB for much less than what the Apple Store does and yet still offers excellent service and prices.  You can buy 8GB from Apple but it’ll cost you for the privilege. There’s much <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_Pro_KITS_(1066_DDR3)-8gb/" title="cheap macbook pro 8gb ram">cheaper 8GB MacBook Pro RAM</a> available and that’s what I recommend.</p>

<p>What’s the** **<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="best ram for mac mini"><strong>best ram for mac mini</strong></a>?. That’s a question I get and have to answer a lot here so I thought I’d write this to help you when you need to decide on buying mac mini ram.</p>

<p>With the release of the new Apple Mac Mini, Apple’s offering a very powerful computer that’s tiny but if you’ve already have a keyboard and mouse and monitor you can save some money and  just buy a mac mini. Lots of buyers of the mac mini also are using these small apple computers as media servers as more and more entertainment is available to buy online.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-3.56.25-PM.png"><img title="Mac Mini Deals" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-3.56.25-PM.png" alt="Best Price on Mac Mini" width="491" height="216" /></a></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013FK9U2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0013FK9U2">Best Price on Mac Mini</a></strong></p>

<p>Anyway, the <strong>RAM for Apple Mac Mini</strong></p>

<p>If you have the original mac mini that uses PC2700 RAM you might be better off upgrading the mac mini to a newer mac mini model as these tiny macs,while small are getting a wee bit dated and adding RAM may or may not be the best deal depending on how you plan on using the mac mini.</p>

<p>That said, I’ll let you decide and you here’s where you can <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/Mac_mini/" title="best mac mini PC2700">buy the best price on ram for the older mac minis that used the PC2700 so-dimms </a>from a few years back now.</p>

<p>Next up, are the intel core duo and intel core 2 duo mac minis. These are a much better deal and until a month or so ago were the most current mac mini you could buy. These mac minis use the much more technologicially advanced so-dimms that are DDR2 PC5300. The intel core 2 duo <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/Mac_Mini_(PC_5300)/" title="fill a mac mini with ram">mac minis full of ram </a>are a great deal if you can find one for cheap. Tecnically apple states that you should have a ‘apple authorized’ service center install ram on this (and all mac minis, unless they have changed this)  but it doesn’t take long and you can do it yourself easily enough. Chances are if you’re looking to upgrade an intel core 2 duo mac mini the warranty is gone anyway (unless you have applecare).  Best prices for Mac Mini PC5300 DDR sodimms are right here.</p>

<p>Lastly, the new Mac Minis. I’ve written above how these are a great deal so I’ll spare you  but the big deal in my mind is that you can now <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/Mac_Mini_KITS_(1066_DDR3)/" title="fill a mac mini with 8GB of ram">fill a mac mini with 8GB of RAM</a> (4gbx2) if you choose, just like the macbooks – it’s the same ram for Mac Minis. Until recently the  most ram you could install in a Mac Mini was 4GB. Not anymore – with 8GB of ram or memory the new Mac Mini is a powerful and versatile apple computer and also the <strong>cheapest mac you can buy.</strong></p>

    <h1><a href="/2010/08/10/the-price-of-ram/">The Price Of Ram</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>For the most part, the price of RAM is pretty much the same from most vendors. Some stores feel the need to be the low ram price leader and they come and go because after a while they can’t keep on selling the ram so cheap and they either raise their ram prices or sadly go out of business. If you’re a regular here you’ll notice a few memory stores that are not here any more..</p>

<p><strong>RAM Prices get lower and lower **the longer I am in this crazy business of monitoring or tracking memory prices from memory stores that I guarantee will be happy to help you with your memory upgrade questions.Over the years, thirteen to be exact – I have watched the price of ram do one thing: **drop</strong></p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW">Cheap Apple MacBook Pro Memory</a></strong></p>

<p>But year over year the newer apple models are announced like the new iMac models that require 1333 MHz RAM as opposed to the older iMacs (by older, I mean last week) that used 1066MHz.</p>

<p>Not so much any more, and actually this is a bad example as the 1333MHz and 1066MHz are pretty much priced the same – perhaps due to just the minor speed bump  I don’t know but usually ram prices for the bigger memory modules, for example 4GB are really pricey to start but over time the prices drop.</p>

<p>Quite the ram price drop eh? From $90 to $40 . That’s quite the memory price reduction in such a short time period.  And this happens again and again. When Powerbook G4’s could first accept 1GB the price for 1GB of RAM was in the thousands of dollars – and what is it now? About the same price as buying you and a friend a cup of coffee at starbucks. How times change.</p>

<p>The moral of this story: If you can, wait to upgrade your RAM.  RAM prices will always drop over the years.</p>

<p>You’ll notice I said if you can. If all you’re doing is email and facebook and time is not money you probably can afford to wait a bit….</p>

<p>But I have never ever regretted buying and installing the <strong>most memory I can</strong> regardless of price. I’ll never get the money back for the dollars I spent on my ram, but I was rewarded with mac after mac after mac that just worked and ran so smooth I forgot about the  RAM and<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="the price of ram"> the Price of RAM. </a></p>

<p>I was happily computing day after day and that’s just priceless to me.</p>

<p>Let’s get this cleared up right away, whatever the price – whether it’s the lowest price or the highest price it doesn’t really matter: <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="memory and ram">Memory and RAM</a> are the same thing and can be used or interchanged when talking about upgrades for your computer. RAM is an acronym for random access memory. See? the RAM name even has the word memory in the description.</p>

<p>But enough about that. What about the prices you say ?  You want memory prices (or ram prices) and that is why you’re here. You plunked some terms into google or bing or MSN or whatever search engine and you’ve landed here looking for (I’m going to guess here) the best ram prices for you computer.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW"><img title="Best Apple Memory Upgrade" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-4.04.05-PM.png" alt="Best RAM Upgrade" width="531" height="274" /></a></p>

<p>Congratulations! You’re here. At ramseeker all I do is track ram and memory prices from online stores you can trust (there was a time I would track prices from everybody, but oh boy the complaints).  Yes I said trust.</p>

<p>You’ve seen  the ‘lifetime guarantee’ stickers on the websites if you have been shopping for ram for any length of time. My first response to these guarantees is to ask ‘who’s lifetime?’  – mine or the store getting my money.</p>

<p>Well, let me tell you about all the memory stores on ramseeker. Every one has been in business selling and supporting nothing but memory (well, that’s a lie – a few sell hard drives and others stuff too)  and they have been in business for at very least: 10 years, most closer to 15 years and then in some cases over twenty years of experience selling ram at the best fair price they can, that is made and manufactured to exact specifications supplied by the manufacturer.</p>

<p>You really can’t go wrong regardless of  what memory price you choose if you stick  to my list of approved memory stores. In fact if the small chance you do buy memory from any one of the memory vendors I list on ramseeker and you do have a problem. ( I can remember 1 time in 13 years,  I think) I’ll help you to try and get it sorted out.</p>

<p>But that won’t happen if you use a memory store I list. The same can’t be said if you end up on eBay or craigslist and you buy some crappy memory from somebody somewhere else. If you buy cheap ram elsewhere that’s great but ask yourself how long they’ve been in business. I make my living with my computer. My time is money and I want to install the ram I can find at the best price and forget about ram and memory prices until I need to buy more ram.  I suggest you do the same and save yourself  a world of troubleshooting. Buy quality memory from quality ram stores and be happy with your purchase.  Yes it’s that easy to get the best memory price and be happy with your ram.</p>

		<div class="post-content"><p> <br />
That’s great that you need the best ram upgrade for iMac but the very first thing we need to do is figure out which apple iMac you use. Maybe you already know this as some apple  fans and websites have a lot of knowledge about all the different types of iMacs and not just ram so if you’ve come with the knowledge of what ram you need for your particular iMac feel free to skip ahead and start to <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="shop for iMac Memory">shop for iMac Memory now</a>.<br />
I track and monitor memory prices on a whole bunch of different iMacs over the years and Apple has this annoying  habit of just calling the iMac ‘iMac’ regardless of year or design. They’re all just iMacs according to Apple and the latest is the ‘iMac’ model that was just released. This has been called different names to differentiate between the older models. I have seen the new iMac as iMac Summer 2010 or iMac mid July or if you’re me I classify the Apple iMacs by ram types they use.If you’re looking for the <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="best ram upgrade for iMac">best ram upgrade for iMac </a></strong>you’ve definitely come to the right place.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8IO6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8IO6">Best Apple iMac Prices</a></strong></p>

<p>But for the rest of us: a little lesson on how to find out what  iMac you have, or at very least I want to help you figure out what RAM you need for iMacs. Here’s how and this technique will work not only with iMacs but with  MacBooks or any other apple computer too.</p>

<p>Go to your apple menu in the left hand corner.</p>

<p>Select: About this Mac</p>

<p>Up comes a window that tells you how much RAM you have and how to see what RAM  you need.</p>

<p>Here’s mine: It’s a MacBook. I know this because apple has screen printed it right on the screen for me to see – nice and handy.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>It will show the processor speed. This is good and in my case I have a MacBook Pro 2.4Ghz. I’ll write this down.</p>

<p>Then I see I have 4GB of RAM installed already (which is the maximum already). And this ram runs at 1067mhz., which is real close to the 1066Mhz RAM I need to buy ( apple rounds up the speed of the memory. My macbook pro ram runs at 1066.6 Mhz , so apple calls it close enough to 1067MHz)</p>

<p>In my case I know know I have a MacBook Pro 2.4GHz and it runs at 1066Mhz, so if I were to shop for ram for my macbook  I would want to buy MacBook Pro 1066Mhz RAM</p>

<p>And that’s all there is to it to find out how much ram  you have. If you need help figuring any of this out be sure to contact me and I’ll be happy to help you get the best RAM upgrade for your iMac or any computer.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2010/08/4gb-ram-for-black-macbook/">4GB RAM for Black MacBook</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001265GI2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001265GI2">Cheap MacBook Memory</a></strong></p>

<p>It depends on which particular black macbook you have but you may be able to install up  to 6gb of RAM inside a black macbook. You would do this by installing one 4GB memory chip into one memory slot while with the other memory upgrade slot you install a 2 gb memory module.</p>

<p>The black MacBooks either max out at 2 GB of RAM or 4GB of Memory depending on what model you have. The later Apple MacBooks will run up to 6GB of memory unofficially, meaning that it’s not supported or documented by apple and some of the earlier models will recognize 3GB of RAM.</p>

<p>Personally, I don’t think it’s worth the bother to upgrade your Black MacBooks past what is recommended by Apple as I think you’re just asking for trouble. Just because you can, doesn’t mean you should.</p>

<p>The intel core duo black macbooks released in 2006 will max out at 2GB of  PC5300 DDR2 RAM.  You will need to buy <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_(PC5300_DDR)-1gb/" title="black macbook 1GB RAM">2x1GB PC5300 DDR sodimms </a>to get the maximum RAM  for this black macbook model</p>

<p>The intel core 2 duo <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_(PC5300_DDR)-1gb/" title="2gb ram black macbooks">black macbook models also max out with 2GB of RAM </a>and the same  memory configuration is required: 2x1GB PC5300 DDR sodimms are needed to get the maximum ram</p>

<p>The intel core 2 duo black macbooks with the ‘santa rosa’ processor will take more ram than the 2GB of predecessors and will recognize <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_(PC5300_DDR)-2gb/" title="black macbook 4GB RAM">4GB of ram by installing  2x2GB PC53000 DDR so-dimms. </a></p>

<p>the 2008 intel core 2 duo black macbook will also take 4GB by replacing the standard memory that came from the factory with<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_(PC5300_DDR)-2gb/" title="2x2GB for black macbooks"> 2x2GB 4GB memory upgrades for black macbook </a></p>

<p>So yes, you could squeeze either 3GB or 6GB into your black macbook depending on what particular black macbook model you have but it’s not something I can recommend. Some trusted memory vendors (OWC comes to mind) say that the larger memory will work just fine with the dark colored apple notebooks but I can’t recommend it and sleep at night.</p>

<p>But for the later black macbooks there’s no reason why you can’t<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="4gb ram for black macbooks"> install 4GB RAM for Black MacBook</a> and rest assured your black macbooks will run just fine with the ram maxed out at 4GB.</p>

<p>RAM prices drop over time. They just do. Especially for the latest and greatest memory for your apple, dell, sony or toshiba as these days all computer brands use the same memory types and sizes but over time ram prices drop:</p>

<p>Here’s an example for iMac Memory:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2010-08-09-at-4.33.42-PM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-212" title="ram prices drop over time" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2010-08-09-at-4.33.42-PM.png" alt="imac ram prices get cheaper" width="523" height="319" /></a></p>

<p>Wild eh? (there’s my canadian showing). The iMac RAM (this particular graph is from 2008 data) dropped from $90 to $40 over the period of the year. That’s a resonable savings over the price of the year.</p>

<p>Can you afford to wait for ram prices to drop? Let’s pretend you make your living with your iMac, or any computer it doesn’t matter but you make money online with your computer. Maybe you’re a photographer who uses photoshop or a writer or maybe you just blog and hope to make a few bucks here and there.. it doesn’t really matter what computer you use or what you do to make money with your computer: my question to you is : what’s it worth to you to wait until ram prices drop?</p>

<p>About a year ago you would have to pay about 1000 dollars to upgrade your iMac to the maximum at the time. The Mac web went crazy! ‘what – they cried – that’s almost the sam price as the iMac!’ What they didn’t realize that for some, even at $1000 for memory upgrades was still the bargain of the year.  If you’re making money with your computer either offline or  online it doesn’t matter the $1000 is the biggest bargain for memory if it means more work getting done easier and smoother.</p>

<p>A lot of people think that the lowest price on ram is so important, but if you make more than that with your skills, your computer and your maxed out memory  the price of the upgrade is really not an issue, especially when you amortize the ram costs over the time you own your computer. I’ve worked it out in other posts, but the ram for my MacBook Pro works out to about $4 a month. Pretty cheap ram if you ask me.</p>

<p>Granted, you could wait for ram prices to drop and as you see in the image above they do – and usually the ram prices drop pretty fast for newer models as more and more memory gets manufactured and  there’s more places to <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="buy ram and memory ">buy ram and memory</a> for your new computer it only makes sense that demand will grow and prices will drop.</p>

<p>The question really is: Can you afford to wait for ram prices to drop, and not <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/pc/" title="when will ram prices come down?">when will ram prices come down</a>?</p>

<p>With 8GB of RAM installed inside a MacBook Pro you could essentially use the MacBook Pro as a desktop replacement – especially the 17 inch version of the Apple MacBook Pros with it’s super big and bright LCD display you really didn’t need an external monitor or any other third party display (of course you could hook up the Apple MacBook Pros to an Apple Cinema Display and really benefit from the maxed out ram and you would have two displays to see all your work at a glance.)</p>

<p>But the downside of buying 8GB of RAM for MacBook Pros back then was the price. To buy 8GB of RAM for the Apple MacBook’s you’d have to fork over almost one thousand of your hard earned dollars to upgrade the ram in your macbook pro to the maximum ram avialable. Heck you could pretty much buy a macbook for the same price as some memory stores were charging for MacBook Pro RAM at the time.</p>

<p>But good things come to those who wait – especially in  the  technical or computer  industry where the rule is that the stuff gets faster and bigger while the price usually gets cheaper.  And for those looking to buy RAM or Memory that’s a good thing because now your MacBook Pro 8GB RAM Memory upgrade isn’t all that pricey – especially when you compare it to years past where you would have to pay a pretty hefty premium to be able to use and afford 8GB of Memory in a MacBook Pro.</p>

<p>As I check the latest <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="ram prices">ram prices </a>on ramseeker I find that at the time of writing,  I can grab 8GB of RAM from many memory stores that are trusted and recommended, such as other world computing, Memory X, 18004Memory, Data Memory Systems and Crucial Technology  – they all offer 8GB of RAM KITs for a pretty good deal – especially when you combine the 8GB RAM and install it in a new MacBook Pro (Spring 2010).  As I write this, the best price for 8GB of RAM for MacBook Pros go for about $250.00 which is a far cry from the $1000 or so you would pay just a year or so ago.</p>

Want to know a little secret? RAM for all current Apple Computers are all pretty much the same. So when you ask me: Hey, Jim – what’s the cheapest mac mini ram? you could also be asking about the cheapest macbook ram and macbook pro ram too.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013FK9U2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0013FK9U2">Cheapest Apple Mac Mini</a></strong></p>

<p>Assuming of course, that your memory requirements are the same speed. ie: 1066MHz macbooks and macbook pro’s and  the newer mac mini’s all use the same ram. iMac too, until about a week or so ago when Apple released the new Apple iMacs – they use DDR3 1333 RAM Memory so you can’t swap it out with the other Mac models. Yet, anyway.  If Apple has released the new iMacs you can guess that the notebook computers will soon be using the 1333 MHz  speed too over time.</p>

<p>Anyway, you’re here because you want to know the cheapest Mac Mini RAM, and I’m happy to help but we need to know a few things first. Most important is what Mac Mini?  Some of earlier Mac Minis used DDR PC2700 SDRAM and then when the intel based Mac Minis came out for years they required the use of DDR2 PC5300 so-dimms and thing s pretty stayed the same for a year if not more and then finally apple released the Mac Mini’s that required the DDR3 1066MHz so-dimms and currently are the faster and most popular ram for Mac Mini computers.</p>

<p>How to find out how what ram you need for your specific Mac Mini is pretty easy:</p>

<p>Go to your Apple Menu in the top left corner of the screen and select ‘about this mac’. What comes up is a screen that shows you how much ram you have installed, and most importantly – what speed of RAM for your Apple Mac Mini you need to buy. Once you’ve got all this info you’re off to the races and you can see the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="cheapest mac mini ram">cheapest mac mini ram </a>at a glance here on ramseeker:</p>

<p>Use the links above and you will find the the cheapest mac mini ram from the 3rd party memory stores I list, (and have been listing for 13+ years now).</p>

<p>One last word of caution: I don’t think the Mac Mini RAM is supposed to be installed by a  “Apple Authorized Service Provider” At least the <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2616" title="mac mini ram install">older Mac Minis had this requirement</a> and I can’t see any reason why this would have changed.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2010/08/apple-macintosh-memory-16gb-macbook-pro-ram/">MacBook Pro 16GB RAM Upgrades</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><div style="float: right; margin-right: 5px;">
</div>

<p><strong>June 2012</strong> – You can now, at long last install 16GB of RAM into a MacBook Pro into the Newest 2012 13 inch and 15 inch Apple MacBook Pro models, but if you want to buy the MacBook Pro with Retina Display you’re hosed when it comes to installing ram after purchase. Like the MacBook Air the ram on the soon to be best selling MacBook Pro is soldered to the motherboard and thus, unremovable and not able to accept an upgrade.</p>

<p><strong>September 2011.</strong> <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/">Crucial Technology</a> now carries <a href="http://www.kqzyfj.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT102464BF1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT102464BF1339">8GB DDR3 SODIMMS</a> at reasonable prices making the 16GB MacBook Pro RAM Upgrades affordable for professionals needing the most RAM possible for the Apple MacBook  Pro.</p>

<p>[table id=15 /]</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>:16GB RAM for MacBook Pro is now available from <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/2011-apple-macbook-pro-16gb-memory-upgrades/">OWC</a> and more memory vendors as time goes by. At the time I write this, 16GB MacBook Pro RAM is far from cheap and might cost more than the MacBook Pro you intend to install it in. Check here For <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_Pro_DDR3_1333Mhz_Memory_Upgrade_Kits-16gb/">current MacBook Pro RAM 16GB prices</a></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002YUF8ZG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002YUF8ZG">8GB DDR3 for Apple MacBook Pro </a></strong></p>

<p>Two words: not yet.</p>

<p>For 16GB MacBook Pro RAM at the time being anyway. 8GB is the most memory you can  install in the MacBook Pros currently.  This will change I guarantee it. The question is: when? When will I be able to install and use MacBook Pro RAM that’s 16GB?</p>

<p>When did Apple release the last batch of MacBook Pros? Spring 2010, right? And just a week or so ago, Apple announced the new iMacs and they can easily use 16GB of RAM and are the first to do so ( Well,…OK, the Mac Pro’s too, soon enough).</p>

<p>But when will the MacBook Pros be able to use 16GB of Memory  (wow, I remember when 16MB was a lot of ram for an apple computer). I would guess we will see new MacBook Pros in late fall or MacWorld 2011 might be a good time to announce the new MacBook Pros too. (this assumes Apple releases computers only arranged around the Macworld shows which doesn’t seem to be the case lately. This used to be a big deal – the macworld trade shows, but with the internet growing and growing you don’t have to have a trade show much any more really. If Apple sneezes it’s online or tweeted or live blogged  in milliseconds anyway)</p>

<p>Back to my crystal ball gazing about when we’ll see new MacBook Pros that could take 16GB of memory and as I said earlier: late 2010 or early 2011. I have NO inside info, but this is just an educated guess.  It might be later if apple just does a simple speed bump to the MacBook Pros and uses the same 1066MHz memory.</p>

<p>The biggest problem with squeezing 16GB into a MBP is just that: room. Pretty much every Mac portable has offered 1 and lately two memory upgrade slots, for the simple reason that as small as they are: so-dimms are still pretty big and there’s also lots of other things in your apple notebook that needed to be squeezed into tight spaces too.</p>

<p>So that means that we could be waiting for a bit. Assuming only 2 memory upgrade slots, there would have to be not only the technology to recognize and accept 16GB on any new future MacBook Pros there would also need to be 8GB macbook memory modules which I have yet to come across.</p>

<p>If you’re looking for 16GB MacBook Pro RAM you might be waiting for a while until the technology catches up. It will, it’s just a matter of when you can <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="16GB MacBook Pro RAM">buy 16GB MacBook Pro RAM</a></p>
