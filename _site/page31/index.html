**</p>

<p>Apple has long set a standard of regular updates to their computer model lines—often at intervals of just a few months.  The MacBook Pro line, however, had, until the introduction in early 2011 of the Apple MacBook Pro 2.3GHz Intel Core i5 13 inch (and its 15 and 17 inch siblings), gone almost a year without updating this product line.</p>

<p>The wait turned out to be well worth it, however, as the Apple MacBook Pro 2.3GHz Intel Core i5 13 inch as the improvements included upgrades to processors, brand new graphic processors, as well as a new peripheral connector.</p>

<p>Starting at a price of $1199 13-inch model featured a 2.3GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor and a 5400-rpm 320GB hard drive.  The i5 was one of Intel’s latest generation of the Core series of processors, also referred to as “Sandy bridge”.  Processor, cache, integrated graphics and memory controller all reside on the same die in the Sandy Bridge configuration, and also now feature the HD Graphics 3000 integrated graphics processor, which had only  previously been available in higher end Apple models. In ratings published in the magazine PC World, the 13 inch MacBook Pro i5 was rated 41 to 57 percent faster than the previous MacBook generation.</p>

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>Apple MacBook Pro 2.3GHz Intel Core i7 (15-inch DDR3) was first introduced in February of 2011 featured Intel’s recently refined chipsets. The new Intel Core i7 architecture put the processor, cache, memory controller and graphics engine on a single chip—an innovative step that reduced the distance that data had to travel, thereby vastly increasing performance as well as processing efficiency.</p>

<p>The MacBook Pro 2.3 GHz Intel Core i7 15 inch boasted Turbo Boost 2.0 an even more efficient version of the original Turbo Boost which was described by Apple as a “dynamic performance technology that dramatically increases the speed of active cores”. Turbo Boost 2.0 worked by automatically shifting core frequency in smaller increments, which allows the processor to manage performance without a loss of efficiency and because this happens automatically—the user notices only that their computing is faster and smoother.<br />
Further enhancing speed in the MacBook Pro 2.3 GHz i7 15 inch was the now standard use of hyper-threading technology.</p>

<p>This dynamic processor improvement enabled two threads to run simultaneously on each core. The end result was that Mac OSX could now recognize eight cores on a quad core processor, four on a dual core processor. To the end user, this translated to tasks spread evenly across a greater number of cores so that multiple applications could be run simultaneously more smoothly, quickly and reliably.</p>

<p>Dubbed as the new convertible, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004XZMCAY/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B004XZMCAY">Dell Inspiron Convertible Tablet PC</a> converts from being both an easy to use touch based  tablet to a more conventional notebook PC all with a twist of the LCD display. Rotate the display  depending on your computing needs. Never have to ask yourself which notebook you should buy or which tablet to buy because this stylish device satisfies both your notebook PC and tablet needs in an all in one design eliminating the need to buy or worse, carry two devices for your portable computing needs.</p>

<p>The memory upgrade options are rather limited for this unique and portable netbook but you can, and should max out the Dell Inspiron Duo to the maximum memory of 2GB by uprading the one memory upgrade slot with a 2GB DDR3 1333Mhz sodimm <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">ram upgrade for the Dell Inspiron Duo</a></p>

<p>Unlike the Duo netbook or tablet above, the Dell Inspiron R laptops are the perfect solution for both home and office computing thanks to unique features such as switch lids to customize the appearance of your Dell Inspiron notebook. (Personally, I think switch lids or any other sticker for you notebook is a complete waste of money, but to each their own)</p>

<p>Like the smaller Dell 14R,  the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004XZMCAY/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B004XZMCAY">15R from Dell</a> offers more screen real estate, a second generation Intel i3 processor running at 2.2 GHz, a 640Gb internal hard drive and 6GB of RAM as standard equipment all for a sale price of just over $500, which isn’t too bad a deal on a Dell. Understandably the Dell Inspiron  15R is one of the best selling notebook computers from this well known name brand  notebook computer manufacturer. While 6GB of RAM installed from the factory is a respectable amount, the Dell Inspiron 15R  will perform even better with a Dell Inspiron Upgrade and  <a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT2KIT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1339">8GB of RAM for the Dell 15R</a> is so cheap it makes sense to upgrade the RAM on your Dell 15R. For further savings you can sell the old ram in your Dell and apply the proceeds to the newer and bigger Dell 15R Memory Upgrade Kit.</p>

  Regardless of what Apple iMac you want to buy this year, from the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004YKXGIK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B004YKXGIK">cheapest Apple iMac</a> to the most expensive and most impressive, 27 inch Apple iMac  running at 3.1 GHz, <strong>you should max out the ram on these popular Apple desktop computers</strong>  as RAM has never been cheaper and time of writing you can fill your Apple iMac with memory for under $100, an unthinkable price not too long ago.
</div>

<p><strong>Can the Apple iMac take 32GB of RAM? </strong></p>

<p>Officially, no. According to the good folks at Apple the iMac maxes out at 16GB, but that’s before you could easily <a href="http://www.kqzyfj.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT102464BF1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT102464BF1339">buy 8GB sodimm memory modules for Apple iMac</a>. These larger memory modules were not available to purchase when the iMac was released in May 2011, so the <strong>official maximum ram of 16GB is what is supported by Apple</strong> and if you want to have your warranty intact, you may want to consider this.</p>

<p>That said, <strong>32GB iMac RAM</strong> just requires you to <a href="http://www.kqzyfj.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT102464BF1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT102464BF1339">buy 4x8GB sodimms</a>. These 8GB memory modules are far from the cheapest Apple computer memory available, and you may want to consider <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ZR4M6I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=B003ZR4M6I">buying a Mac Pro instead</a>, where the cost to fill your Mac to 32GB  is not only cheaper, but is recommended and approved by Apple. If you need 32GB of RAM in a desktop,  it’s my opinion you’re better off with the Apple Mac Pro.</p>

<p>The Mac Mini is available in two configurations:</p>

<p>Regardless of what Mac Mini you choose. (I would go with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004YLCLM6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B004YLCLM6">cheaper $599 Mac Mini</a> and  use the $200 savings towards buying new peripherals) these new 2911 Apple  Mac Mini’s are real easy to upgrade the RAM on and with the exception of the Mac Pro might be the easiest Mac to add memory upgrades to. If you can unscrew the lid on a jar of peanut butter you can upgrade mac mini RAM with ease.</p>

<p>And you should <strong><a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT2KIT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1339">upgrade the RAM on the Mac Mini to the maximum allowed of 8GB</a></strong>.  The cheap Mac Mini comes out of the box with just 2GB of RAM installed so it’s a perfect candidate for a memory <strong><a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT2KIT51264BC1067%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1067">upgrade all the way to 8GB</a></strong> as is the 4GB 2.5GHz  Mac Mini which does benefit from more RAM installed at the factory, but you will pay for it. In addition to the faster processor with the Apple Mac Mini, you’re also paying considerably more for the 4GB of RAM over where you could buy  it from a brand name ram vendor such as <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">Crucial </a>or Corsair or Kingston, which offer more value when it comes to Apple RAM Upgrades. The street price of  a 2GB RAM upgrade is only about $10 at time of writing.</p>

<p>And despite what the <a href="http://www.apple.com/macmini/specs.html">Apple Store may tell you</a> you <strong>don’t need to buy RAM from Apple for your Mac Mini</strong>.  As long as you buy ram from a reputable memory store like <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">Crucial</a>, you will have no problem when it comes to add RAM to your brand new 2011 Apple Mac Mini.</p>

<p><strong>Can I install 16GB of RAM into the 2011 Apple Mac Mini?</strong></p>

<p>Like the case  for <strong>32GB for the Apple iMac</strong>,  the answer is twofold: yes, but no.</p>

<p>Yes, you can upgrade the Apple Mac Mini to 16GB  because  the Apple Mac Mini accepts two <a href="http://www.kqzyfj.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT102464BF1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT102464BF1339">8GB 1333Mhz SDRAM sodimms</a>, and back in July 8GB sodimms for Apple Mac Mini were rare and thus, really pricey – costing more than the Mac Mini  itself. Things have changed a bit since and <strong>8GB ram modules for Mac Mini are starting to drop in price</strong> some, but you will still pay a pretty penny to get 16GB of RAM for Mac Mini this year.</p>

<p>The second part of the answer  is that <strong>Apple only supports 8GB  of RAM in these small desktop computers</strong>. If you install 8GB x 2 to get to 16GB you should have no problem with that much Mac Mini ram installed, but in the rare case things go amuck when you install the 16GB of RAM you’re on your own. It’s very doubtful that the Apple limited warranty would cover installing more memory than what was supported. It’s always been my policy to recommend you stick to the maximum RAM as per Apple. 8GB of memory upgrades for Mac Mini should be more than enough RAM if you’re using the Mac Mini for home office, home or school tasks.</p>

<p>If you do need a Mac with 16GB you should buy an iMac or Mac Pro, which offers both faster processors as well as added memory upgrade capacity.</p>

<h2 id="apple-mac-pro-memory-upgrades">Apple Mac Pro Memory Upgrades</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ZR4M6I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=B003ZR4M6I"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1478" title="Buy Mac Pro" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Screen-shot-2011-03-26-at-2.03.40-PM2.png" alt="Best Macintosh Pro" width="159" height="259" /></a></p>

<p>The Apple Mac Pro from Apple is getting long in the tooth and we have yet to see a 2011 Apple Mac Pro release from Apple this year  for their professional based desktop computer and the newest  Apple Mac Pro you can buy has a release date of August 10, 2010, over a year ago.</p>

<p>But regardless of age of the current Mac Pro lineup, these are still considered new computers and are available as such in 2011.</p>

<p>Available as either a 8 Core configuration featuring</p>

<ul>
  <li>Two 2.4GHz Quad-Core Intel Xeon E5620 “Westmere” processors</li>
</ul>

<p>or one Quad core processor Mac Pro  featuring</p>

<ul>
  <li>One 2.8GHz Quad-Core Intel Xeon W3530 “Nehalem” processor as the standard processor configuration</li>
</ul>

<div>
  The memory you need for the Apple Mac Pro gets a little tricky as even though they are considered new Apple Mac Pro models the processor  speed and type determines  what memory upgrade you need to buy:
</div>

<div>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Dual-processor systems</strong> <ul>
        <li>
          2.4GHz system: 1066MHz DDR3 ECC SDRAM
        </li>
        <li>
          2.66GHz and 2.93GHz systems: 1333MHz DDR3 ECC SDRAM
        </li>
        <li>
          Eight memory slots (four per processor) supporting up to 64GB of main memory using 1GB, 2GB, 4GB, or 8GB DIMMs
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      <strong>Single Processor systems</strong> <ul>
        <li>
          2.8GHz and 3.2GHz systems: 1066MHz DDR3 ECC SDRAM
        </li>
        <li>
          3.33GHz system: 1333MHz DDR3 ECC SDRAM
        </li>
        <li>
          Four memory slots supporting up to 32GB of main memory using 1GB, 2GB, 4GB, or 8GB DIMM
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <div>
    As you can see from the chart above, there&#8217;s many choices when it comes to Apple Mac Pro memory so be sure to buy the right speed of memory for Mac  Pro whether you need to buy Mac Pro 1333GHz or Mac Pro 1066GHz RAM, as it can be confusing  and you want to be certain you match  the right ram for the right Mac Pro.
  </div>
  
  <div>
    My guess, and the <a href="http://www.macrumors.com">Mac Pro Rumors</a> tend  to confirm this, is that there&#8217;s a Mac Pro refresh in the works  that will not only allow for faster processors but will sychronize the ram requirements so that all new 2011 Apple Mac Pro models use the  same memory type, just like all the  other Apple computer models do.
  </div>
</div>

<h3 id="can-the-apple-mac-pro-accept-64gb-of-ram">Can the Apple Mac Pro Accept 64GB of RAM?</h3>

<p>Like the Apple iMac and Mac Mini above, the technical answer is no if you have the single processor. The single  processor Mac Pros max out at  32GB of RAM. The dual processsor Mac Pro systems can in fact accept 64GB of RAM if you have the budget for it. 64GB of RAM for Mac Pro is not cheap and unless you really need the fastest desktop possible to get your work done faster, you may be able to get away with 32GB of Mac Pro Memory.</p>

<p>The MacBook Pro is my favorite Apple Computer when it comes to Apple portables and when you consider what it costs to buy a MacBook Pro in the first place, a MacBook Pro RAM upgrade is a no brainer if you ask me.  Like the <a href="http://www.nike.com">Nike </a>ad says ‘just do it’.</p>

<p>editor’s note: I would buy the cheapest MacBook Pro which in this case is the 13 inch MBP and use the money you saved for the next upgrade MacBook Pro, which might be as early as late 2011 and then use the savings from not buying the more expensive MacBook Pro’s to put towards the  2012 MacBook Pros when they are released in just a few short months. This is just one strategy to saving money on not only RAM, but also the computer the memory is being installed into.</p>

<p>But regardless of what Apple MacBook Pro you already own or are  considering buying upgrade the RAM to the maximum using a 8GB DDR3 SDRAM sodimm memory upgrade kit.  8GB MacBook Pro memory is so cheap  that it makes absolutely no sense to me why you run the stock MacBook Pro ram configuration when for under $50 you can max out  the RAM on your MacBook Pro</p>

<p><strong>Can I Upgrade MacBook Pro Memory to 16GB?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, you can. You need  to buy 8GB 1333Mhz sodimms  on sale and install them in the two memory upgrade banks or sockets available for an upgrade by removing the stock Apple RAM with more advanced and high quality 8GB laptop memory. The problem with adding 16GB MacBook Pro memory is that it’s still pretty pricey and could cost as much as the MacBook Pro you’re installing the 16GB upgrade into.</p>

<p>You’re better off with 8GB of MacBook Pro Memory. 8GB is the deal when it comes to Apple MacBook Pro Memory Upgrades. 16GB is still too expensive in 2011 to be a worthwhile upgrade.  Besides, installing 16GB into a MBP is not something that Apple recommends and neither can I. You may void your warranty by installing more memory than what is the maximum at time of release. I’d stick to 8GB and enjoy the Apple MacBook Pro with a full warranty intact.</p>

<p>This will be the shortest part of  this article  because you cannot upgrade the memory on the  Apple MacBook Air, due  to the fact that the memory upgrades are not available to be upgraded, and you’re stuck with the memory the MBA came with when you bought from the MacBook Air from Apple which are currently available in these four MacBook Air configurations:.</p>

<p>As you can see from the Apple MacBook Air lineup  for 2011,  the cheapest MacBook Air comes pretty much crippled with lack of RAM and all could use at least 8GB MacBook Air Memory to really make these small and fast notebooks from Apple shine, but Apple decided to make the maximum ram  at 4GB. Considering the Mac OS Lion requires 1GB of RAM, that doesn’t leave you with a lot of memory to play around with. That said, these are consumer based notebooks not professional notebooks and with the MacBook Air you get true plug and play as there are no upgrades  you can, or need to perform when you buy a MacBook Air as opposed to the Apple MacBook Pro that requires a ram upgrade to really see what  the MBP can do.</p>

<p>It’s easier to show you <a href="http://www.apple.com">where not to buy memory</a> upgrades for Apple computers than to provide you with a list of all the great stores you can <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/where-to-buy-computer-memory-upgrades/">buy memory upgrades</a> from, but you can get a great deal on RAM  for Apple without much trouble at all and if you’re in  the market for name brand memory such as <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">Crucial Technology RAM</a> , or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;ref_=nb_sb_ss_i_0_15&amp;field-keywords=kingston%20memory%20ddr3&amp;url=search-alias%3Delectronics&amp;sprefix=kingston%20memory&amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">Kingston </a>or Corsair, now is te best time in the 15 years I have been checking ram prices for Apple computers online. <strong>8GB of RAM for the iMacs, MacBook Pro or the Mac Mini in 2011 has dropped in price to half what it was just a few months ago</strong>, so if you’ve been sitting on the fence waiting to buy ram, don’t wait much longer as  I can’t forecast ram prices getting  much lower than they already have been.</p>

<p>If you have already have a new 2011 Mac but have been watching for ram prices to drop, again you really should upgrade the ram on your new Mac at your earliest convenience. The Apple computers are far from the cheapest computer you can  buy comparable PC’s for much less but the benefit of Apple over other brands of computers is that they tend to hold their resale value and adding RAM is just one more way to not only increase your day to day productivity but also increase the value of your Mac when it’s  time for an Apple Computer upgrade for your next new Apple computer.</p>

** In our increasingly mobile, fast paced society–the need for processing speed on laptop and notebook computers has created a second issue of importance for end users: longer battery life. With business and professional users of the Apple product line travelling more and working increasingly from venues outside the office cubicle the need for longer battery life was increasingly important.</p>

<p>Apple introduced the Apple MacBook Pro 2.8GHz Intel Core 2 Duo 15” in the summer of 2009 to address this issue with its “innovative built-in battery for up to 40 percent longer battery life.”</p>

<p>In the past, a longer lived battery meant adding more bulk to the computer, a major selling point of the Apple MacBook Pro2.8GHz 15” was the fact that this model and those subsequent extended useable wireless battery power to seven hours on a single charge without adding to the size, weight or price of the unit. Distinguished by “Adaptive Charging”, the new battery iteration promised to deliver up to 1000 recharges before reaching 80 percent of original capacity. This innovation was at the time nearly three times the lifespan of conventional computer batteries. Not only was longer battery life attractive in terms of end use, the increasingly “Green” conscious consumer could well appreciate that longer battery life means fewer depleted batteries and less waste. Further appeal to the environmentally minded, this model along with the entire MacBook Pro line up achieved EPEAT* Gold status and meets Energy Star 5.0 requirements a new standard for environmentally friendly notebook design.</p>

<p>The Apple MacBook Pro2.8GHz 15” included the equally green LED backlit display, renowned for its greater color intensity with a 1440 x 900 standard resolution; the processor a speedy 2.8 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo with 6MB shared L2 cache. This model also featured the glass Multi-Touch™ trackpad, an illuminated keyboard, an SD card or ExpressCard slot, a FireWire® 800 port and state of the art NVIDIA graphics married with a 2.8 GHz Core 2 Duo processor, a 500 GB hard drive.</p>

<p>The Apple MacBook Pro2.8GHz 15” offered the following features:</p>

<p>Lightweight, environmentally friendly aluminum unibody case;</p>

<p>1066 MHz front-side bus;</p>

<p>500GB serial ATA hard drive running at 5400 rpm, with Sudden Motion Sensor;</p>
