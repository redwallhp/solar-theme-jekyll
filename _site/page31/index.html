   <B> <h1><a href="/2011/10/how-much-memory-can-i-buy-with-one-hundred-dollars/">How Much Memory Can I Buy With One Hundred Dollars?</a></h1></B>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>I got asked this today, so thought I would share my answer here as I feel that RAM for your computer  is the best upgrade you can do for both your Mac or  PC and with RAM prices being so cheap right now,  a hundred  bucks goes pretty far, and if you can afford to double that hundred dollars to two hundred dollars you’ll find you may be able to buy not only enough RAM to fill your notebook or desktop, but if you can live with a smaller sized boot drive you can also upgrade to a SSD for even more savings.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>$100 worth of RAM </strong></p>

<p>You could easily fill any 2011 notebook with enough RAM for the hundred  bucks, and unless you are in the need for 16GB of RAM in a notebook with only 2 memory upgrade slots, 8GB of RAM is more cost efficient and with rebate, costs close to a third of that cost overall.</p>

<p>Corsair  notebook RAM is  the cheapest 8GB RAM I could find  and with a rebate until the end of the month that drops the price down to $37, you’re not even anywhere near your hundred dollar budget and for most notebooks, the 8GB RAM Upgrade is more than enough and you’ll still increase the  performance of your notebook for much less than the hundred dollars you have set aside.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002YUF8ZG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=B002YUF8ZG">Buy 8GB Memory ON Sale for under $100. </a></strong></p>

<p><strong>$100 worth of hard drive. </strong></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003NE5JCE/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B003NE5JCE">Cheapest SSD Drive</a></strong></p>

<p>There’s even more choice when it comes to buying a new hard drive to replace the stock and ever shrinking stock hard drive that came with your computer. You can buy a big conventional hard drive if you care more about  storage space than speed, or if a faster hard drive i  what you’re after replace the drive you have with a much faster (but smaller) SSD drive. 60GB SSD’s are under $100 and 128BB SSD’s are dropping in price too if you can wait a bit longer before you upgrade to a solid state drive.</p>

<p>Another option is the Seagate Momentus XP that offers the best of both worlds: 4gb of SSD storage for your operating system and othet  commonly used files and 500GB of storage space so you’re not limited to drive space. This is especially important for notebook computer users who want to carry all their files with them for easy access at any time.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003NSBF32/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=B003NSBF32"><strong>Momentus XP by Seagate</strong></a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>$100 gets you far more memory and  hard drive space than even when compared to a year ago and with ram prices so low it’s never been a better time for a ram upgrade.</p>

<p><strong>Apple iMac 3.4GHz Quad-Core Intel-Core i7 (27-inch – DDR3) Mid 2011</strong></p>

<p>By industry and end user standards, the fastest performance available on the Mac platform has generally been found on the MacBook Pro product line.  However, with the introduction of the <strong>Apple  iMac 3.4GHz Quad-Core Intel-Core i7 (27-inch – DDR3) Mid 2011</strong>, Apple created a desktop every bit as fast as its recently released quad core MacBook Pro models released early in 2011.</p>

   <B> <h1><a href="/2011/10/what-is-the-sweet-spot-for-hp-envy-ram/">What is the Sweet Spot for HP Envy RAM?</a></h1></B>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>The HP envy is a fast notebook computer from HP designed for the professional notebook user in mind. Sure, there are cheaper notebooks from HP that do the job when it comes to the simple stuf like web browsing and social networking, but if you want to play games or get work done you need a more powerful processor the HP Envy provides.</p>

<p>Take the popular <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051OLNHE/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B0051OLNHE">HP ENVY 14-2050SE Beats Special Edition notebook</a> for example. This HP Envy notebook already comes with 6GB of RAM as default memory and if your notebook computing needs are light you can stop reading right here. **6GB of RAM is enough for web surfing or blogging or any other lighter computer task.<br />
**</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051OLNHE/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B0051OLNHE"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3259" title="HP Envy Beats special edition" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Screen-Shot-2011-10-19-at-5.15.02-PM.png" alt="HP Envy SSD Deals" width="305" height="279" /></a></p>

<p>But, if you need to do some work or play games the maximum RAM for this particular notebook tops out at 16GB of RAM, but this ram upgrade for HP Envy’s is still a tad pricey at $600 or so and so you’re much better off if you limit your HP Envy RAM needs to 8GB for the time being.</p>

<p>If you want to save money and seeing as this particular HP Envy already ships with 6GB when shipped from HP you could forgo a ram upgrade altogether as there’s really <strong>little difference between 6GB of RAM and 8GB for HP Envy notebooks</strong>. Even though RAM for HP Envy notebooks are pretty cheap, you would be much better off forgetting about a RAM upgrade for HP notebooks and installing a solid state drive into your HP Envy laptop instead if you feel the need to maximize the performance of your HP laptop.</p>

<p>The benefits of a faster solid state hard drive far outweigh any advantage you would see by adding just 2GB of RAM to a 6GB equipped HP notebook already. But, by swapping out the factory HP envy drive with the faster SSD you’ll spend just a bit more as <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004W2JKWG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B004W2JKWG">quality name brand SSD drives are on sale</a></strong> for about $100 these days and up. Still a bit pricey, but when compared to the cost of 16GB for HP envy, the solid state drive is the best upgrade for the HP notebook you can buy in 2011.</p>

<p>Wait until we’re a few months into 2012 at least before you consider upgrading the HP envy RAM to the maximum of 16GB allowed and just get by with the 6GB for now. Save your money for a much cheaper 16GB ram upgrade next year as the prices for 8GB laptop memory will continue to drop to a more stable level and <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/deal-ocz-technology-60-gb-vertex-2-series-sata-ii-2-5-inch-solid-state-drive-ssd-drops-to-under-100/" title="Deal. OCZ Technology 60 GB Vertex 2 Series SATA II 2.5-Inch Solid State Drive (SSD) Drops to Under $100">buy a cheap solid state hard drive </a> instead if you want to upgrade you  HP envy notebook.</p>

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>I have mentioned before I am *this close* to moving to the USA and one of the things that the USA offers over Canada is choice. I can choose  my internet provider, home  phone service, even email web host to be three different companies offering services, or.. you can buy all three online services from one provider and in my case that would be from Verizon as I already have Verizon wireless service from them and might as well pay one bill for all three and probably save some money in the process.</p>

<h2 id="introducing-verizoncentral">Introducing VerizonCentral</h2>

<p>Verizon Central is a website that’s a front door or portal or everyday start page for your browser which allows you not  only quick and easy login to your verizon wireless account, but a slew of other features including news, weather and other fun stuff too:</p>

<p><strong>Most Popular News</strong></p>

<p>This is pretty self explanatory. The biggest news of the day is displayed here, and constantly updates.</p>

<p><strong>More News</strong></p>

<p>In addition to the headline news, there’s more news in not only the news, but also in Entertainment, Sports, Today’s Deal of the Day, and the trending today chart offers what’s hot when you search using Verizon Central. Local News is  also offered so not only do you get to read international  and national news, you’ll be up to date in your community thanks to Verizon Central.</p>

<p><strong>Watch TV Online. </strong></p>

<p>This might be the biggest advantage to Verizon Central – the ability to watch TV right from your computer.</p>

<p><strong>Today in History </strong></p>

<p>This section allows you to look back at what was happening not only a year ago today, but also for other dates in history  that share the same date as today.</p>

<p><strong>Verizon Sign In</strong></p>

<p>Maybe I should have put this right at the top, but this might be the main reason you visit Verizon Central – to login to your Verizon Account, and  the Verizon web portal allows you to do just that with ease. Of course, you can also register for a Verizon Central Account if you don’t have one yet too.</p>

<p>**Local Weather Forecasts **keep you up to date on not only the latest weather conditions in your area, but also what’s in store for the weather in the upcoming days.</p>

<p>The Verizon Central Web Portal is a very good way to start your day and keeps you up to date and entertained as well with all the news and topics important  to you.</p>

<p>**VerizonEmail **When you sign up for Verizon cable services, you get a free and easy to remember email address for your personal email. In my case, my verizon email adresss might be ramseeker@verizon.net which is pretty easy to remember when you think about it compared to some of the domain extensions from other internet service providers.</p>

<p>Apple has long set a standard of regular updates to their computer model lines—often at intervals of just a few months.  The MacBook Pro line, however, had, until the introduction in early 2011 of the Apple MacBook Pro 2.3GHz Intel Core i5 13 inch (and its 15 and 17 inch siblings), gone almost a year without updating this product line.</p>

<p>The wait turned out to be well worth it, however, as the Apple MacBook Pro 2.3GHz Intel Core i5 13 inch as the improvements included upgrades to processors, brand new graphic processors, as well as a new peripheral connector.</p>

<p>Starting at a price of $1199 13-inch model featured a 2.3GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor and a 5400-rpm 320GB hard drive.  The i5 was one of Intel’s latest generation of the Core series of processors, also referred to as “Sandy bridge”.  Processor, cache, integrated graphics and memory controller all reside on the same die in the Sandy Bridge configuration, and also now feature the HD Graphics 3000 integrated graphics processor, which had only  previously been available in higher end Apple models. In ratings published in the magazine PC World, the 13 inch MacBook Pro i5 was rated 41 to 57 percent faster than the previous MacBook generation.</p>

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>Apple MacBook Pro 2.3GHz Intel Core i7 (15-inch DDR3) was first introduced in February of 2011 featured Intel’s recently refined chipsets. The new Intel Core i7 architecture put the processor, cache, memory controller and graphics engine on a single chip—an innovative step that reduced the distance that data had to travel, thereby vastly increasing performance as well as processing efficiency.</p>

<p>The MacBook Pro 2.3 GHz Intel Core i7 15 inch boasted Turbo Boost 2.0 an even more efficient version of the original Turbo Boost which was described by Apple as a “dynamic performance technology that dramatically increases the speed of active cores”. Turbo Boost 2.0 worked by automatically shifting core frequency in smaller increments, which allows the processor to manage performance without a loss of efficiency and because this happens automatically—the user notices only that their computing is faster and smoother.<br />
Further enhancing speed in the MacBook Pro 2.3 GHz i7 15 inch was the now standard use of hyper-threading technology.</p>

<p>This dynamic processor improvement enabled two threads to run simultaneously on each core. The end result was that Mac OSX could now recognize eight cores on a quad core processor, four on a dual core processor. To the end user, this translated to tasks spread evenly across a greater number of cores so that multiple applications could be run simultaneously more smoothly, quickly and reliably.</p>

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>Released along with five new the MacBook Pro models in the 13, 15 and 17 inch display sizes, the Apple MacBook Pro 2.0 GHz offered a significant advance in processors. Intel’s recently redesigned quad core Intel Core i7 chipset increased performance on the early 2011 releases by 50 percent offering more speed, stability and reliability out of the box. Well suited to both gaming and professional multi application computing, the early 2011 generation of MacBook Pro models set new benchmarks for laptop performance across the board.</p>

<p>Apple MacBook Pro 2.0GHz Intel Core i7 15 inch featured the 2.0 GHZ Intel quad core i7 processor, code named “Sandy Bridge”.
