<ul>
  <li><strong>RAM Type </strong>Laptop or Desktop memory?</li>

  <li><strong>Shipping Cost </strong>Some offer free shipping and others don’t.</li>
  <li><strong>Shipping Speed </strong>How fast do you need your memory</li>

    <h1><a href="/2012/11/first-look-crucial-upgrade-advisor/">First Look: Crucial Upgrade Advisor</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>Most other memory store where you can buy online call the tools they offer to help you configure your PC with more memory memory finders, memory tools or even memory configurators, but only <a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-1548159-10273954"><strong>Crucial calls theirs an ‘upgrade advisor’.</strong></a> I guess it is but you’re not asking the website what ram you use and it spits back an answer. Nope, you have to tell it all the specifics of your PC and then wait for it to match the specs with the RAM.</p>

<p>Also, if you forgo the memory advisor from Crucial you can find your ram numerous ways and one way is to visit Crucial and then select memory&gt;shop by manufacturer and select your manufacturer you will see that the best upgrades for Apple are for much older computers. I mean really? when was the last time you thought about upgrading your PowerBook G4? The ram would cost as much as you can buy the notebook on eBay. This is a missed opportunity if you ask me. I think it would do Crucial much better to promote more modern Apple memory like the new 2012 MacBook Pro’s or iMacs – memory that people are wanting to buy.</p>

<p>Quibbles aside: If you use the Crucial Upgrade Advisor you get one thing that might just trump all – and that’s a guarantee that the RAM you will buy will work – or you get to send it back for a refund (or an exchange). This is actually a great marketing scheme if you think about it: You do all the work by entering all your data (which you have to do anyway to figure out your memory) and then Crucial’s advisor spits out the RAM (and BTW tends to list the largest ram first – at least they got that right) and guarantees it will work.</p>

<p>Other stores guarantee their RAM but save for a badge or something on the bottom of their sites’ homepage their warranty isn’t something that’s promoted much, and in this area alone Crucial’s got them beat. They promote the warranty that comes with the advisor which I am sure sells more memory and yet lowers support costs. First, you enter the data so as long as you enter the right info there’s no way the advisor can mess up. A lot of computers use the exact same part so they’re just selling you the same ram regardless of PC model. And because you used the advisor from Crucial instead of just guessing there’s less chance of returns. In effect their guarantee costs very little to offer because they know the ram will work and it’s tested name brand memory. There will be very few problems when handled correctly and Crucial knows this.</p>

<p>The Crucial Upgrade Advisor is a good deal for both customers and Crucial alike. It keeps support costs low and the you know you will get the right ram for your Mac or PC, <a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-1548159-10273954"><strong>guaranteed</strong></a>.</p>

    Corsair RAM is a really good value
  </p>
</div>

<p> </p>

<p>Corsair RAM has been around for at least as long as I have been tracking memory prices, if not longer and you can buy Corsair RAM directly at <a href="http://www.corsair.com">Corsair.com </a> or from third party websites and memory resllers such as Amazon and others.</p>

<h2 id="corsair-memory-products">Corsair Memory Products</h2>

<p>Corsair ram comes in a variety of different memory types, sizes and speeds as well as selling hard drives and other PC related products such as PC cases, cooling supplies and USB flash drives, but I want to first look at the different Corsair Memory Types. Corsair memory is offered in five main computer memory types:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Intel Memory Upgrades</li>
  <li>AMD Memory Upgrades</li>
  <li>Mac Memory Upgrades</li>
  <li>Notebook Memory Upgrades</li>
</ol>

<p>These main memory types from Corsair  are also available for sale for any budget from budget memory upgrades to the most advanced memory technology available today. The Corsair memory upgrade categories are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Dominator Platinum</li>
  <li>Dominator</li>
  <li>Vengeance</li>
  <li>XMS</li>
  <li>Value Select</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="where-to-buy-corsair-memory-upgrades">Where to Buy Corsair Memory Upgrades</h2>

<p>Corsair memory is offered directly from the company (a bit pricey, if you ask me) and like pretty much all memory stores offers an easy to use shopping cart as well as a memory configurator to help you order the correct RAM for your notebook or PC. Corsair calls their configurator the Corsair Memory Finder. But if you want the best deal on Corsair memory I suggest you check Amazon for cheaper prices on Corsair ram than you could buy from the factory direct. There have even been times where there has been a rebate coupon for Corsair memory that increases the savings even more. Below are som of the best selling Corsair Memory Upgrades on sale today:</p>

    <h1><a href="/2012/11/what-is-triple-channel-memory/">What is Triple Channel Memory?</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>Triple Channel Memory is ram that offers (big surprise) more bandwidth than dual channel or even single channel memory. Single Channel memory runs at 64 bits, Dual Channel memory is 128 bits and lastly triple channel memory runs at 192bits.</p>

<p>DDR3 memory is the common name for triple channel memory upgrades and can be in the form of both DDR SDRAM dimms for destkop computer use or in sodimm memory modules for use with notebook computers. Common speeds of triple channel memory can be DDR3 1600MHz or DDR3 1333Mhz with the prior being the most popular triple channel memory type for computers in 2012 and beyond.</p>

<h2 id="triple-channel-memory-use">Triple Channel Memory Use</h2>

<p>It’s recommended to install triple channel memory in matched pairs. Most computers offer either two, four or in some cases eight memory upgrade slots with various memory upgrade banks  and it’s best to fill each bank with the same memory type and speed. It’s not  suggested to mix triple memory speeds as this can hinder PC performance and in some cases damage the motherboard.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-buy-triple-channel-memory">How to Buy Triple Channel Memory</h2>

<p>One way to get the correct ram for your desktop or PC is to use a memory upgrade configurator that will help you in getting the right RAM for your PC. All you do is enter your PC manufacturer, model name, and in some cases model Number. For example, manufacturer name would be Dell, model name would be Inspiron and model number would be N5010. When you have this information all you have to do is select the correct information and the memory upgrade store will help you get the right ram for your desktop or notebook PC.</p>

<p>Some computer  memory manufacturers also create a memory upgrade software that scans your  computer system to find the right memory type and then suggests compatible memory upgrades. <a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-1548159-10273954">Crucial Technology</a> is one memory manufacturer that offers this.</p>

<p>If  you’re a more experienced computer user who is comfortable building your own PC you can forgo the memory configurator and software altogether and buy triple channel memory from a selection of memory stores, or  if you prefer you can order triple channel memory from Amazon. I find that in most cases Amazon has the cheapest memory upgrades. Below are some of the best selling triple channel memory upgrades on sale today:</p>

    <h1><a href="/2012/11/how-to-get-a-free-pc-memory-test/">How To Get a Free PC Memory Test</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>PC Memory, in rare instances can go bad. RAM Memory is a very sensitive computer component that is susceptible to static electicity that can fry your memory very quickly, so it’s always a good idea to use an anti-static wristband and install ram in a humid environment to reduce the chance of static electricity. But even if you install the memory correctly you can still have problems with your PC memory but thankfully there are many methods to test your PC memory for any errors.</p>

<h2 id="remove-the-memory">Remove the Memory</h2>

<p>This seems kindof obvious I know, but one way to test ram to see if it’s bad is to remove and replace the memory upgrade with another memory chip. Usually, you have upgraded the ram in your PC with newer and larger memory upgrade modules, and if you still have the original factory installed memory upgrades all you have to do is replace the ram you suspect has gone bad with the older RAM. If your PC now runs without incident, then you know the RAM is bad and will have to be replaced. In the event of problems with your PC you should check your RAM for any problems</p>

<h2 id="free-pc-memory-testing-software">Free PC Memory Testing Software</h2>

<p>You don’t have to remove the ram you think has gone bad. There are many software programs that will allow you to test the memory in your PC without having to replace it to diagnose the memory problems:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.memtest86.com/"><strong>Memtest86</strong></a></p>

<p>This software is free software that allows you to test your PC ram for any errors. It’s easy to use and is a free download. This memory testing software does not require any software installed on the PC to run. Just download the ISO and using your  CD burning software. Easy to use, and diagnose any memory problems with this free memory testing software</p>

<p><a href="http://www.softpedia.com/get/Tweak/Memory-Tweak/Microsoft-Windows-Memory-Diagnostic.shtml"><strong>Windows Memory Diagnostic</strong></a></p>

<p>This memory testing software is like Memtest86 above, as it does not require an operating system to run and will run on any PC. Just download the ISO and follow the instructions to burn a bootable CD to test your PC memory with the Windows Memory Diagnostic Tool</p>

<p><a href="http://www.memtest.org/"><strong>MemTest86+</strong></a></p>

<p>Note the plus sign at the end. This is newer memory testing software that tests for memory module failure. Download the ISO, burn to a CD and you can test the memory on your PC with ease with MemTest86+</p>

<p>These are just three of the memory testing software for your PC. One other way to be certain your PC memory is error free is to buy brand name memory or ram from a trusted memory manufacturer like Crucial, Corsair, or Kingston Memory. All these manufacturers offer a lifetime replacement guarantee in the event that your memory upgrade goes bad. Below are some of the more popular memory upgrades available on sale today:</p>

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>Micron Technology has been manufacturing ram and more recently flash memory products since the early 1980’s and at one point actually sold micron branded memory upgrades. But in 2012, Micron Technology sells most of the memory and flash memory they manufacture under two brand names:</p>

<h2 id="crucial-technology1"><strong><a href="http://www.crucial.com">Crucial Technology</a></strong></h2>

<hr />
<p>Crucial Technology is one of the best memory upgrade brands you can buy and have been selling memory upgrades online for over 15 years now (at least as long as I have been tracking and monitoring ram prices.</p>

<p>One of the main features of Crucial Technology is the number of tools they offer to help you get the right memory upgrade for your computer regardless of make or computer brand. Using either the memory configurator where you select the Make and Model of your computer, or the application you can download that scans your computer for the right memory upgrade for you Mac or PC.</p>

<p>Popular memory upgrades are just a mouse click away for Apple, Dell, HP and Sony computer memory upgrades</p>

<p>In recent times as demand for memory upgrades have declined, Crucial Technology have expanded their product line to include both traditional and solid state hard drives as the prices for solid state hard drives continue to drop it’s now possible and affordable to replace the standard hard drive in your notebook or desktop computer with a much faster solid state hard drive. In some cases, a SSD drive upgrade can cost less than $100.</p>

<h2 id="lexar2"><strong><a href="http://www.lexar.com">Lexar</a></strong></h2>

<p>Lexar is the flash technology site for Micron Technology. Where the Crucial Brand is all about desktop and notebook upgrades, Lexar offers flash memory common in digital camera memory and USB flash drives that have become a must have computer accessory for transferring data from one computer to another. Some of the more popular flash memory products from  Lexar include compact flash memory, micro SDHC memory, and USB flash drives with capacity up to 64GB available today.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2012/11/what-is-dual-channel-memory/">What is Dual Channel Memory?</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>Dual Channel Memory is commonly known as DDR or DDR2 memory and usually ships in two distinct sizes: SDRAM DDR2 DIMMS for desktop computers and DDR2 SDRAM sodimms for notebook computers. Speeds for DDR2 memory range from PC-3200 to PC-6400. In 2012, DDR2 dual channel memory is not the fastest DDR memory you can buy with DDR3 technology up tp 1600Mhz and beyond being the most popular DDR memory upgrades today. DDR2 memory upgrades were more popular from the period of about 2005 to 2008 when they were replaced with the much faster DDR3 memory standard.</p>

<h2 id="how-dual-channel-memory-works"><strong>How Dual Channel Memory Works</strong></h2>

<p>Dual Channel Memory is usually installed in pairs, and refers to the fact that the DDR or DDR2 memory is used on the moterboard. With two memory slots on a DDR2 motherboard available for memory upgrades, when DDR2 or even DDR memory is installed the computer can process memory data twice as fast as the DDR standard. The dual channel allow for one memory bank to read and write data while the next memory bank is getting ready for the next stream of data. This eliminates wait time as one memory bank is always ready for the next stream of data, effectively doubling the read and write timings. To gain the advantage that DDR2 memory upgrades offer, it is recommended that you install DDR2 memory upgrades in matched pairs for the most reliable computing experience.</p>

<h2 id="most-popular-ddr2-memory-brands">Most Popular DDR2 Memory Brands</h2>

<p>DDR2 dual channel memory is available in both generic memory where the memory vendor manufactures or resells the memory and the warranty for DDR2 generic memory depends on the vendor or  you can buy name brand DDR2 memory upgrades from a wide array of computer memory manufacturers: Crucial Technology, Kingston Technology and Corsair Memory are just a few DDR2 memory upgrade manufacturers that offer brand name memory and warranty support for dual channel memory upgrades.</p>

<h2 id="where-to-buy-dual-channel-memory">Where To  Buy Dual Channel Memory</h2>

<p>You can buy dual channel memory from a wide array of memory vendors (see my list of memory stores bel0w) but some of the best prices and  cheapest dual channel memory upgrades tend to be found online at Amazon. Below are a few examples:</p>

    <h1><a href="/2012/11/how-to-upgrade-flash-memory/">How To Upgrade Flash Memory</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>Flash Memory is becoming the defacto memory standard of 2012 and int0 2013 with products from digital cameras to notebook computers and even smartphones using flash memory upgrades for more storage for your data. Flash memory comes in many different form factors depending on the device you want to use flash memory for but  below are some of the more common flash memory upgrades on sale today:</p>

<h2 id="solid-state-drives">Solid State Drives</h2>

<p>Solid state hard drives have become the standard hard drive installed in many new notebook  computers (and to a lesser extent, desktop computers too) thanks to advancements in manufacturing and more demand for the much faster flash storage that SSD drives offer. At time of writing, one can buy a 128GB SSD drive for less than $100 and 256GB SSD drives  can be had for under $200.00. What was once a luxury on the leading edge is becoming more mainstream each and every day. SSD drives offer no moving parts, much faster read and write times and startup times than even the fastest standard drive. The disadvantage to the SSD drive is that larger capacity SSD’s at 512GB and up are still much more expensive than traditional hard drives in the same capacity</p>

<h2 id="compact-flash-memory">Compact Flash Memory</h2>

<p>Compact Flash Memory is usually used in more advanced digital cameras such as pro-sumer or  professional DSLR’s and offer faster read and write times than SDHC memory cards can offer that are smaller in size and more popular in compact digital cameras and other devices. Compact Flash memory upgrades are available in a wide array of sizes in speeds but common and best selling compact flash memory upgrades are 32GB  and up to 400x in speed.</p>

<h2 id="sdhc-memory">SDHC Memory</h2>

<p>SDHC memory is available in many sizes. The standard micro SDHC memory cards are a favorite for digital camera and computer users thanks to their smaller size when compared to compact flash memory upgrades.  Micro SD memory cards are also a very popular choice for cellular and smartphones and it’s hard to imagine that storage space of up to 64GB can fit on a memory card smaller than your fingernail.</p>

<h2 id="usb-flash-memory">USB Flash Memory</h2>

<p>These might be the most popular types of flash memory and grace many a keychain or computer users desktop. With many shapes and sizes these USB drives or thumb drives come in a variety of  shapes and sizes from standard design to novelty designs shaped like teddy bears. USB flash memory is a popular marketing tool thanks to the fact that you can buy USB flash drives with your  company message screen printed on the flash drive itself. With a cost of under $1.00 each in  some cases, customized usb flash memory drives are a great way to promote your  company and your message or logo.</p>

<h2 id="where-to-buy-flash-memory-upgrades">Where To Buy Flash Memory Upgrades</h2>

<p>All of these types of flash memory upgrades are available at numerous stores online but I find one of the best places to buy flash memory of any kind is at Amazon. They constantly have the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957"><strong>lowest prices on flash memory</strong></a> regardless of type or size.</p>

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>If you’re looking to buy cheap computer memory, you’ve come to the right place because all I do every day is help you get the cheapest computer memory prices possible and I have been monitoring and tracking cheap computer memory prices for over 15 year now. If you’re in the market for cheap memory I list prices that are the lowest I could find.</p>

<h2 id="cheap-apple-computer-memory"><strong>Cheap Apple Computer Memory</strong></h2>

<p>I started ramseeker tracking ram prices for just Apple computers so if there’s one thing I know, it’s where to get computer memory for Apple computers cheaply. In 2012, almost all current Apple computers take the same amount of RAM. Mac Mini, MacBook Pro and Apple iMac all use  DDR3 1600Mhz  SDRAM sodimms. Here are the lowest prices on Apple Memory I could find:</p>

<h2 id="cheap-hp-computer-memory"><strong>Cheap HP Computer Memory</strong></h2>

<p>Memory for HP notebooks are another type of memory you can get cheaply now and like the Apple products, most HP notebooks like the HP Envy will allow up to 16GB of RAM installed and not only is HP memory cheap, but  it will allow you to work much faster regardless of whether you use your HP notebook for fun or business.</p>

<p>[table id=15 /]</p>

<h2 id="cheap-dell-computer-memory">Cheap Dell Computer Memory</h2>

<p>Dell Inspirons, XPS or Latitude models all take more ram and like the HP and Apple’s above you can get ram much much cheaper when you buy the memory anywhere but from Dell which tends to overcharge for their memory upgrades. You’re much better off buying ram from one of the memory stores below. When you do, not only will you save money on RAM, your dell will run faster and allow you to open more applications at the same time. Most Dell notebooks this year can accept up to 16GB of RAM. Check your manual .</p>

<h2 id="cheap-sony-computer-memory">Cheap Sony Computer Memory</h2>

<p>Sony computers are usually not known for being the cheapest computer you can buy, unless you get a deal on a Sony notebook  most  Sony VAIO models tend to be expensive than their DEll or HP counterparts.  But just because the Sony notebook is pricey doesn’t mean you can’t  get ram for Sony notebook computers cheaply. Most Sony’s can accept  up  to 16GB of RAM and installing ram in a Sony notebook is easy and cheap when you buy ram for Sony Notebooks from these stores:</p>

<p>In addition to the memory stores in the pricing tables above,  I like buying cheap memory from Amazon as a lot of times they tend to have better prices on RAM than any other memory store and offer not only the cheapest computer memory prices but outstanding return policies too. Here are some suggestions for cheap computer memory:</p>

    <h1><a href="/2012/11/where-to-buy-imac-ram/">Where To Buy iMac RAM</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>The iMacs in 2012 are becoming one of the most popular Apple desktops to be released this year for a few reasons: First, the design is even slimmer for the new Apple iMacs vs the 2011 Apple iMacs, and secondly you can upgrade some of the higher end iMac models all the way to 32GB, which is double the ram capacity for older iMacs from laster year. The ram upgrade chart for the current iMacs look like this:<img class="size-full wp-image-6672 alignnone" title="where to buy iMac RAM" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Screen-Shot-2012-11-05-at-3.10.27-PM.png" alt="" width="837" height="744" /></p>

<h3 id="ghz-apple-imac-215-inch-screen">2.7GHz Apple iMac 21.5 inch Screen</h3>

<p>This iMac ships from the factory with just 8GB of ram installed (4GBX2), but you can max out the ram on this iMac model and I suggest you do because iMac ram is so cheap this year.</p>

<h3 id="ghz-apple-imac-215-inch-screen-1">2.9GHz Apple iMac 21.5 inch Screen</h3>

<p>This iMac is the same specifications when it comes to memory – you still start with 8GB of iMac ram from Apple, but you can max out the ram on this iMac to 16GB</p>

<h3 id="ghz-apple-imac-27-inch-screen">2.9GHz Apple iMac 27 inch Screen</h3>

<p>If you cough up big money for the 27 inches of screen real estate, you not only get a bigger display, you also get more memory capacity – but if you add 8GB of ram x 4 you can max out the memory on the new Apple iMacs all the way to 32GB of RAM – one of the first Apple iMacs able to accept 32GB of RAM</p>

<h3 id="ghz-apple-imac-27-inch-screen-1">3.2GHz Apple iMac 27 inch Screen</h3>

<p>The fastest Apple iMac also requires the same ram as the other 27 inch Apple computer and will also accept 32GB of ram in the four memory upgrade slots the Apple iMac has.</p>

<h2 id="where-to-buy-imac-ram">Where To Buy iMac RAM</h2>

<p>All of the Apple iMac models above require the newest in Apple memory technology  – and that’s DDR3 1600Mhz sodimms.  The sodimms are considered notebook ram but the iMac, despite the desktop form factor does require the smaller sodimm for notebook compters vs the SDRAM DIMM designed for desktops computers.</p>

<p>The prices for iMac RAM continue to drop over the years and in fact the memory for iMacs have been the best deal I have ever seen on Apple iMac memory. Below are the best prices on iMac RAM and the memory stores where you can buy iMac RAM.</p>
