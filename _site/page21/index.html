<br>

		<div class="post-content">Microsoft is [offering a trade in program](https://easytradeup.com/us/en/pages/tradeup/home) where you can get up to $200.00 for your older PC or $300 for your Mac: 

> For your Trade-in to qualify for the promotion it must be a working, complete and undamaged Laptop or Macbook up to six years old. Laptops and Macbooks must have a minimum 11.3” display. Your Trade-in must be complete with a working battery and power supply. Please do not return monitors, keyboards or mice.

One interesting thing I noted that was [according the photos](https://easytradeup.com/us/en/pages/tradeup/trade-ins) you can even send them a Mac with missing keys. 

I'm not sure why you would ever want to do this and switching from a Mac to Windows seems like a bad idea all around and considering the price you can get for a Mac that's just six years old you're probably better off selling the Mac on your own and using the funds for your new Windows Machine.

**Not Yet.  You can&#8217;t buy 32GB MacBook Pro Memory Upgrades**

The most memory you can install is 16GB into a current Apple MacBook Pro . The Apple MacBook Pro&#8217;s available on sale in 2013 max out at 16GB of RAMThis applies to all Apple MacBook Pros currently available online for sale:

  * Apple MacBook Pro 13-inch: 2.5GHz
  * Apple MacBook Pro 13-inch: 2.9GHz
  * Apple MacBook Pro 13-inch: 2.5GHz with Retina display
  * Apple MacBook Pro 13-inch: 2.6GHz with Retina display
  * Apple MacBook Pro 15-inch: 2.3GHz
  * Apple Macbook Pro 15-inch: 2.4GHz with Retina display
  * Apple MacBook Pro 15-inch: 2.7GHz with Retina display

I wonder: will the maximum RAM upgrades you can install in any MacBook Pro will stop at 16GB. I guess it&#8217;s time to come to ask the question: **How much ram do you need? **

The Apple MacBook Air models don&#8217;t even come with upgradable ram upgrades. If you buy a MacBook Air and want the most ram you can install in it  you better be ready to buy an 8GB MacBook Air because if you don&#8217;t you&#8217;re stuck with the 4GB option which leaves you little ram left over once you get the MacOS up and running. That said, small screens and 4GB of RAM seem to be a popular choice with Apple customers, especially if the MacBook Air is the secondary or light use computer. (another option would be to buy a chromebook)

**Apple MacBook Pro Memory Price Increases**

Also, RAM for Apple MacBook Pros have close to doubled in recent months. This is one of the very few memory price increases I have seen in the 15 years I have been monitoring ram prices for Apple computers. Usually, ram prices for Apple computer have always dropped in price over time.This is a first.

At current ram prices, the cheapest 16GB RAM for MacBook Pro you can buy  is about $125.00.  This means if you were to buy 32GB MacBook Pro RAM it&#8217;s quite possible that the price would be double that if not more with 32GB MacBook Pro memory costing as much as $250.00 to $300 or even more. And god forbid if you buy the memory from the Apple Store, as this option will [cost you much much more][1].

A MacBook Pro with 32GB would be a pricey notebook computer. Assuming the [best price you can get on a 13 inch MacBook Pro is about $1100.00 ][2], and adding 32GB MacBook Pro RAM costing you say $300, the cheapest MacBook Pro maxed out with 32Gb of RAM could cost you close to $1500.00, and if you upgrade to the Apple MacBook Pro 15-inch: 2.7GHz with Retina display you&#8217;d be north of 3 grand with 32GB of RAM installed.

This all assumes that ram prices for MacBook Pros stay stable too. If you start adding RAM later it might even cost you more. Now if you&#8217;ve got deep pockets or need the fastest MacBook Pro money can buy, then the price for 32GB of RAM for MacBook Pro is not much at all, especially if you use your MacBook Pro for photo or video editing you need the fastest MacBook Pro you can buy and the price of RAM or the MacBook Pro might not matter at all because you&#8217;re making money with your MacBook Pro.

**Sell Your Factory Installed MacBook Pro RAM**

One thing that might help offset the cost of 32GB would be to[ sell your old ram][3] that came with the MacBook Pro in the first place. Let&#8217;s say you&#8217;ve got 16GB of RAM from your MacBook Pro installed from the Apple directly. You could remove the ram and trade it for 32GB MBP ram. You won&#8217;t get a whole lot for the old ram but there&#8217;s many memory vendors that will allow you to trade in your old ram for larger memory upgrade modules effectively lowering the price you have to pay for the bigger ram for your MacBook Pro.

**You&#8217;re Going To Have To Wait for 32GB MacBook Pro RAM**

I don&#8217;t know any memory store that sells 32GB for MacBook Pro just yet. There&#8217;s MacBook Pro rumors that a 2013 refresh of the MacBook Pro&#8217;s could happen at WWDC later this summer but like all Apple rumors, that&#8217;s all it is at this time &#8211; a rumor.

Of course,[ just like I did with 16GB of RAM][4] I&#8217;ll let you know when 32GB of RAM for MacBook Pros does come available and of course I will find the lowest price you can pay for 32GB MacBook Pro Memory

   <B> <h1><a href="/2013/02/best-selling-laptop-brands-for-2013/">Best Selling Laptop Brands for 2013</a></h1></B>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content">When buying [memory upgrades for your notebook][1] it&#8217;s often because you **[bought a brand new laptop for 2013][2]** at least, that&#8217;s usually when I personally buy RAM because I want the fastest computer when the computer is brand new and not wait until the computer gets old and slower when compared to newer computer models, regardless of brand.

## Best Laptop Computer Brands for 2013

In 2013 as smartphones and and tablets increase market share, you might think that the notebook computer is dead, but this is not the case because even though tablets and phones increase in popularity nothing can beat typing on a real and physical keyboard and a notebook computer is  the only portable computing device that offers such. With that in mind, here&#8217;s a look at some of the best manufacturers of notebook computers for this year, in 2013.

## Google

New to the list of best selling notebooks this year when compared to last year is Google, with their line of notebook computers called chromebooks. [**Google offers some of the best selling notebooks**][3] this year thanks to the fact that these are the cheapest notebook computers you can buy. Take the Samsung ChromeBook for an example. At $249.00, you get an 11 inch notebook for 2013 that runs on the Google Chrome OS and offers excellent portable computing value for the price.

Some may argue that the Chromebook isn&#8217;t a real notebook computer when compared to Dell or HP or other notebook brands but that&#8217;s because you can&#8217;t run traditional applications on it like you can on a Windows based notebook computer. But with the flexibility and price the chrome OS offers thanks to Google Drive applications and the popularity of blogging sites or software that don&#8217;t require any applications but offer all work to be done online or in the cloud the chromebook is  an excellent notebook for the price and is small and light enough to be carried with you everywhere yet still offers USB ports, a full sized keyboard and a bright 11 inch LED display, it&#8217;s no wonder that the chromebooks for 2013 are the best selling notebook computer brands in 2013 so far this year.

## [**Buy a Google ChromeBook Now**][3]

## Apple

&nbsp;

On the other end of the spectrum when comparing Apple notebooks to Google notebooks, you get one of the best selling computer brands this year, but at a price. The cheapest price for a notebook from Apple will cost you close to $1000, if not more, depending on what model you buy. The MacBook Air is what one might consider a direct competitor to the Google Chromebook when it comes to screen size (the 11 inch MacBook Air) but the OS is much more advanced on the Macintosh OS than if you were to buy a Chromebook. Google wants you to primarily to work in the cloud, while the MacBook is more of  a traditional PC. The advantages of the Apple notebooks vs Chromebooks is the OS and the available software. Faster processors and more RAM are also a distinct advantage of an Apple Macbook Air or MacBook Pro and if you&#8217;ve got other Apple products such as iPhones or iPods, they all work together without fuss or problems. Apple offers a high end solution for portable computing and charges a premium for the tight integration of hardware and software in Apple notebooks.

## [**Buy an Apple Macbook Pro Now**][4]

## Dell

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Dell has long been a price leader when it comes to buying a cheap notebook online and in 2013, this hasn&#8217;t changed and their 2013 Dell Inspiron notebooks always tend to be one of the best selling notebooks of the year. The 15 inch Dell Inspiron is one example of a best selling notebook computer from Dell. Compared to the price of an Apple MacBook Pro, the Dell Inspiron is an absolute bargain at under $400.00 on sale for a full featured 15 inch notebook with a fast Intel Core i3 processor, 6gb of RAM and a 500GB hard drive all standard. The Inspiron also features one of the bigger displays when compared to the Apple or Google offerings with a 15.4 inch display. Windows 7 Home Premium is included for the price and you can upgrade to Windows 8 very inexpensively too if you feel the need.  There was a time when an under $500 notebook from Dell would be considered an absolute bargain but with notebook prices dropping over time thanks to cheaper components inside a Dell notebook you don&#8217;t need to look too hard to get a great deal on a Dell notebook in 2013.

## [Buy a Dell Inspiron Now][5]

## Toshiba

&nbsp;

Despite the fact that Toshiba has the very worst naming conventions on their notebook PC&#8217;s with long model numbers instead of memorable names like the other manufacturers of notebooks above, you should consider buying a Toshiba notebook in 2013 due to the fact that the folks at Toshiba make a very good high quality product. You can buy cheaper notebooks to be sure (Acer comes to mind) but when in the market for  a higher quality notebook at a great price don&#8217;t hesitate to consider Toshiba notebook. Take the** Toshiba Satellite C855D-S5320 **for example.**  With a street price of under $400 **this is a great deal on a notebook for 2013. There&#8217;s not too many under $400 notebook computers you can buy today that offers the quality you can expect from Toshiba. This particular model of Toshiba notebook features a E-Series Dual-Core E2-1800 1.7 GHz processor with a 15.6 inch display, Windows 8 and 4GB of RAM with a 500GB hard drive.

## [Buy a Toshiba Notebook Now][6]

## Lenovo

&nbsp;

Lenovo is a relatively new notebook computer brand but if you look closely at the Lenovo brand you will see that this brand is really a subsidy of IBM, a name in computing that dates back decades, so you can rest assured you are buying a quality product when you are considering the Lenovo brand. Offering a top ten notebook for 2013 is not easy in the notebook shopping landscape with so many deals being available for a notebook computer this year. Lenovo offers a sub $500 notebook computer in the form of the Lenovo G580 notebook that offers a 15.6 inch display and comes with a fast Intel Core i3 processor, 4GB of RAM with a 500GB hard drive and Windows 8 pre-installed.

## [Buy a Lenovo Notebook Today][7]

<span style="font-size: 13px;">These are but a few of the best selling notebooks you can buy for 2013 and this list will change over the course of the year and I will do my best to keep this list updated but when shopping for a new notebook this year from some of the best brands, some models have a very short lifespan and replacements will soon be available so that&#8217;s why I recommend you keep an eye on the best selling notebooks of 2013 available </span>

		<div class="post-content">This small 11 inch notebook from Samsung is different vs any other notebook computer under $400 due to the fact that with the Chromebook you are running Google&#8217;s Chrome OS as opposed to either  Mac OS X or Windows 8, the more popular operating systems that come pre installed on all other notebooks on sale under $400.

Granted, you can only run Google&#8217;s own applications such as Gmail, Google Docs, etc but there are also many programs available for the Chrome OS on the Google Chrome store. For everyday  computing needs where all you will be doing is some web surfing or blogging or basic spreadsheet and other tasks that don&#8217;t require a Mac OS or Windows application you will be hard pressed to find a better deal on a notebook under$400 for 2013.

   <B> <h1><a href="/2013/01/where-to-buy-windows-7-ram/">Where To Buy Windows 7 RAM</a></h1></B>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content">When you&#8217;re in the market for a brand new computer in 2013 most all computer buyers this year will tend to be buyers of notebook computers or even tablet computers, but both of those options may not be the best computer of 2013 for you. With a brand new laptop this year it will come equipped with a default install of Windows 8. Many say that Windows 8 is better than Windows 7 when you compare the two versions of Windows you can still buy today. (Why anyone would want to buy Vista is beyond me).

Despite the new Metro design and features offered by Windows 8, some (like me) actually prefer to stick with Windows 7. Why? Because it&#8217;s familiar. I still cannot get used to the new user interface of Windows 8, even if it is considered to be a better Windows operating system. Yes, you could install Windows 7 on a Windows 8 notebook, but then you will have to download Windows 7 from Amazon or some other online retailer that sells Windows 7 and this will cost you at least $100 or so. You&#8217;re better off keeping your older Windows 7 notebook and adding more memory to the notebook you have rather than try to install Windows 7 on a PC designed for Windows 8

Adding more memory to your PC running Windows 7 offers a very big speed increase and the ability to run more applications simultaneously than if you were to just to stick with the standard memory configurations on most notebooks running Windows 7.  It&#8217;s easy to add more ram to a Windows 7 notebook too &#8211; all you have to do is this:

**1. Find out what Memory Type you need to buy**. Most online memory stores can help with this thanks to their online memory configurator. You usually just enter your PC manufacturer, model name and you will get information on what type of memory you need to buy, what the maximum is you can install in your PC and how many memory upgrade slots you have to replace the stock ram with the new RAM.

2. **Remove the old Factory Memory Upgrades. **In most cases, you will have to remove the original RAM from the factory to install new memory upgrades. This is especially true if you are trying to upgrade a notebook computer as there are usually just two memory upgrade slots to use so you will definitely have to remove the factory ram first. With desktop computers running Windows 7, you have a bit more room as there is usually many memory slots (4 or more) and not all memory slots tend to be filled by the factory leaving you with lots of room for additional desktop memory to be installed.

**3. Install Larger Memory Modules. **Once you have removed the older memory modules, and have bought the new ram upgrades for you Windows 7 computer, all you need to do is add the newer  and larger ram upgrades.

## Where To Buy Windows 7 RAM

Below are a few suggestions for stores that offer the best prices on Windows 7 RAM Today:

<br>

		<div class="post-content">The answer, is yes.

The answer also is : **Max out the memory on your computer with new memory.** You&#8217;ll get the best performance boost that** offers more bang for dollar spent **than any other upgrade you could make on your computer. Most new software (excepting freeware, shareware, or um, borrowed software) costs way more than a **new memory upgrade** would cost, yet the **new ram upgrade offers performance enahancements** that are usually unprecedented  and will also allow you to use your** new ram to speed up your computer**. Once you&#8217;ve **added memory to your desktop or notebook computer **you will find that the new fancy software that you bought will run faster than before you added the memory.

**Used Memory**, I suppose ten years ago wasn&#8217;t as bad an idea as** memory prices for both desktop and notebook computers were much much higher** on average. Now you can get a new notebook and ** fill it with memory** for under $500 in most cases and the** performance adavantages will be higher than what used memory could be**. Unless you&#8217;re a hobbyist, and are tinkering with a project where even new memory is too much money to spend, than you can search ebay/craigslist, etc for used memory.** But it&#8217;s my opinion that new memory is really the only way to go **unless you&#8217;re really on a tight budget and can spend the time and make the effort for used memory. But even then, the used memory doesn&#8217;t come with any support usually.

For me, it&#8217;s **new memory or not at all**.

For new computers, Apple or PC. and except for the odd few configurations (8gb for the iMacs seems to be a little on the high prices, but prices are dropping) I suggest maxing out your new computer purchase right at the beginning when the computer is still new and offers the best return on your money, that&#8217;s the time you want add new memory to your Mac or PC I would think.

I&#8217;m writing this on a year-old plus MacBook Pro and I upgraded the memory and replaced the factory ram with new memory at a total cost of $100 to fill my Macbook with new ram. Over the year, this works out to a cost of  .27 cents per day for my new memory.

Some might argue that I&#8217;m biased as I track and monitor the new memory prices but it&#8217;s really hard to argue with an upgrade that costs on average  less than a quarter per day.

		<div class="post-content">## When will the new 2013 MacBook Air Be Released?

It&#8217;s now pushing December 2012 as I write this and the MacBook Air line from Apple is [**now the oldest Mac you can buy today**][1]. iMacs, Mac Mini&#8217;s and MacBook Pros have all seen refreshes and are new. In fact, the <del><strong>2012 iMacs aren&#8217;t even shipping yet</strong></del> (update, they are here) and the 2013 MacBook Air should be the next Apple computer to be released. I hope.

Ultrabooks are here to stay, make no mistake and now that [**PC notebooks are under $400**][2] and[** ultrabooks under $500**][3] one has to ask themselves if it&#8217;s even worth it to buy a MacBook Air in 2013. IF you want to buy the cheapest ultrabook you can you can now **pick up a chromebook for under $250**. Granted there&#8217;s lots you can&#8217;t do with a chromebook thanks to it&#8217;s OS that&#8217;s really not much more than a chrome web browser. If you need to do some serious video editing or photo editing a chromebook isn&#8217;t for you, but you must admit it&#8217;s an attractive alternativ to a MacBook Air. You could buy five chromebooks for the same price as one MacBook Air. I know that with my work it&#8217;s all web based for the most part and I think I could  make do with one. (I should buy a chromebook and test it and report back).

## Is There a New MacBook Air Soon?

I have no inside information on the workings of Apple and their future products but I see a release date of early 2013  &#8211; maybe as early as mid January. This may be a little early as the lastest MacBook Air models were released in June 2012 so that&#8217;s just seven months from the last release if I&#8217;m right. Apple may take a bit longer to finally release a new MacBook Air but early winter to early spring is a good guess, and that&#8217;s all it is: a guess.

## Will There Be a $500 MacBook Air?

I don&#8217;t  think so. Apple has priced their products as high end consumer electronics rather than selling commodities like PC&#8217;s that are just the sum of their parts with Windows OS tacked on.  These windows ultrabooks  are priced at $500.00 now. Apple products have always been extraordinarily higher. Take tablets as an example: An iPad Mini  costs over $300 while android based tablets like the Nexus 7 from google or the Kindle from Amazon are priced under $200.00. I think if there&#8217;s any discount on future MacBook Air&#8217;s it will be small. There could be a small price decrease &#8211; maybe a bump both MacBook Airs down in price by $200, but again &#8211; why would Apple do this? These small and light Apple notebooks are selling in the thousand dollar price range quite nicely and have for some time. I doubt Apple would do this.

## **What New Features Will the New MacBook Air Have?**

A faster processor is a given. If nothing else, you&#8217;ll get a speed bump. I also wonder if Apple will include a lightning connector on future Apple product? I have no idea how this would be used but it&#8217;s a thought. A retinal display is probably a given, but one argument against this would be that the MacBook Air would cannibalize sales of MacBook Pros that already have retina displays.  I don&#8217;t think that Apple will really change the MacBook Air that much. There&#8217;s only so small they can make the thing and I think they are real close to being there. More RAM and bigger SSD drives are another really good possibility as both ram and SSD prices continue to drop. This might be a good way for Apple to justify the higher pricing. More RAM and more storage is always welcome

## Would I Buy a MacBook Air in 2013?

I&#8217;ve lived without a MacBook Air for over five years now, and I&#8217;ll probably continue along this path. I have a relatively fast windows notebook  with Windows 8 with a lot more weight than the MacBook Air, but a much bigger screen and much cheaper. I could buy three of these notebooks for the price of one 13 inch MacBook Air. If I need to buy any notebook, I think a Google Chromebook is probably on my shopping list for any new ultrabook computer. I live in chrome and a text editor and as I type this I am listening to Pandora so I don&#8217;t even need  to store any music. I think that in 2007 a MacBook Air was a much more attractive choice for a small and light notebook, but now with release of netbooks and chromebooks and ultrabooks with Windows 8 there are much cheaper  choices for small and light computers in 2013.

   <B> <h1><a href="/2012/11/who-has-the-best-memory-scanner/">Who Has the Best Memory Scanner?</a></h1></B>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content">There&#8217;s lots of ways to find out what memory you need to buy but the best way to get the right ram for your Mac or PC (or even unix box) is to **use a memory scanner. **Depending on what store you buy memory from, you could be using a memory tool,memory finder, or memory software or memory configurator.

Some memory stores list a million products on their front page with best selling memory lists, best memory upgrade brands, and so on but almost every store offers a memory scanner to help you buy the correct memory. Most memory scanners work the same: You pick the brand, computer type and model and a program spits back of compatible memory upgrades. The scanner also offers a buch of other useful information too like the maximum memory allowed, memory banks available, memory type required and more. But, like all things in life some memory scanners are better than others  so let&#8217;s  have a look:

[**Amazon**][1]. Amazon may have the cheapest prices on RAM but you need to know what memory type you need. Sometimes for the Mac Memory you can search for MacBook Pro memory for an example  and you will get some results returned, but to view the entire selection you really should know what ram you need to buy before you visit Amazon. One way to find out the right ram is to read reviews on memory upgrades and check the best selling memory upgrade lists too. If everybody else is buying a particular type of RAM, you can probably do some research and see if the ram that&#8217;s selling will work in your Mac or PC.

**[RAMJET][2] **Ramjet has had the exact same website since the mid-nineties and at one time did not have any memory selector tool at all &#8211; just links to pages but in recent years they do offer a pull down menu like the others that allow you to choose ram for popular  Macintosh computers. RAMJET does sell PC memory too but their primary focus and sales are for Macintosh memory upgrades. One area for improvement might be in the sorting &#8211; they list ram for the oldest models on the top of the page and you have to scroll for newer modeles. I would reverse this.

[**Crucial Technology**][3]

Crucial has in some ways almost too much choice when scanning for the right RAM. You can start with their memory configurator, use the memory scanner that scans your PC and reports on ram compatibility. Lastly, you can search for model names and I have goodl luck with that as the search engine usually offers the information I need. When Crucial finds the right ram for your PC you get info on maximum memory, memory type and memory slots available

[**Data Memory Systems **][4]DMS just updated their website and now offers many more memory upgrades than before but you have to work a bit hardter to find them as you have to select type of memory (desktop, notebook etc), memory brand, memory line and  memory model. That&#8217;s a lot. But, the good news is once you find the page with your memory upgrade on it , there&#8217;s a lot of information including what the original memory is/was  in your specific computer model in addition to the maximum memory, number of memory slots available and memory type.

**[OEMPCWORLD][5] **is the only other computer memory store besides Crucial Technology that offers both a memory scanner and memory configurator. The configurator works just like all the others and matches your  PC to the memory type but the scanner actually scans your PC for the memory you need. It&#8217;s noted that this is a one-time scan that happens and the software doesn&#8217;t scan the contents of your hard drive &#8211; it&#8217;s more interested in your hardware than software. If you prefer to not use this for security or paranoia or both, then you can still use the memory configurator that this store offers.

**Who has the best memory scanner?** If you want to have software actually scan your computer you have to choose between Crucial and OEMPCWORLD and I give the nod to Crucial due to the brand name. If you don&#8217;t want to use a system scanner to find the right memory upgrade than you&#8217;re using a memory configurator and most offer the basics such as maximum memory, memory type and  number of memory upgrade slots. A few will just match you  up with memory type and leave you on your  own to figure out the maximum ram your PC would run. I would avoid these and the memory stores I list above do a much better job of helping you buy memory for your notebook or desktop PC.
