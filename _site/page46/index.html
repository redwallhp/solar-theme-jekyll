<p>When shopping for <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com">MacBook Pro Memory </a> it can be a good idea to shop for memory upgrade kits for MacBook Pro as some memory stores offer memory upgrade kits that include two MacBook Pro memory upgrade modules.</p>

<p>Usually, these memory upgrade kits make sense to buy as you usually save money on MacBook Pro ram as you will need to buy two memory modules anyway if you want to maximize the ram on your MacBook Pro and 8GB kits for MacBook Pro is the most memory you can install in MacBook Pros in 2010 (and 2011 so far, but my guess is this  will change with new MacBook models being announced soon enough).</p>

<p>The good news is 8GB RAM upgrades for MacBook Pro in kit form (4GB x 2) have dropped in price considerably when compared to just over a year ago where you would pay almost as much as the cost of the Apple computer itself just to Max out the RAM.</p>

<p>At time of writing this you can buy 8GB RAM for MacBook Pro for as little as $<del>110</del>, $40.00 which when you amortize the cost over a year – a reasonable time to use the same notebook computer, the cost add the most RAM to your MacBook Pro works out to less than $1.00 per day. For that money spent with your 8GB DDR3 RAM purchase you get a faster, smoother running Apple professional notebook that can mean you get your work done faster than if you had not upgraded your memory.</p>

<p>The prices for 8GB for MacBook Pros change constantly. Below is a table of the cheapest RAM prices for  MacBook Pro that gets updated continually, and includes other memory upgrades as well as just 8GB kits for MacBook Pro</p>

<p>I’ll start this article by offering advice on where not to <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="buy mac mini ram">buy Mac Mini RAM</a>, and that’s from <a href="http://www.apple.com" title="apple">Apple</a> directly. The good folks at Apple do a great job at making many great products and there’s no doubt that I’m an Apple fan, but when it comes to selling RAM, you will not find the cheapest ram at our favorite fruit company.<br />

<p>Where you will find <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="mac mini ram deals">great deals on Mac Mini RAM</a> to buy is right here as I have been tracking and monitoring memory prices since 1997 which is longer than well, anyone – and over the years I have created a chart which compares Apple Mac Mini RAM upgrades for whatever Mac Mini you are looking to upgrade:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/Mac_mini/" title="mac mini pc2700 sdram">The first Mac Mini requires PC27000 DDR RAM</a></p>

<p>The second series of Mac Mini uses PC5300 DDR SDRAM and is marketed as both <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/Mac_Mini_KITS_(PC5300)/">Mac Mini memory upgrade kits</a> or by <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/Mac_Mini_(PC_5300)/">individual Mac Mini PC5300 memory modules</a>.</p>

<p>The latest and newest Apple Mac Minis to be released require DDR3 SDRAM and <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/Mac_Mini_(1066_DDR3)/">Mac Mini DDR3 memory</a> and <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/Mac_Mini_KITS_(1066_DDR3)/">Mac Mini DDR3 memory upgrade kits</a> are available to purchase for Apple’s smallest and cheapest Apple computer available today.</p>

<p>Now that we have determined the different Mac Mini models and what memory modules you will need to buy the next question is <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="where to buy mac mini ram">where to buy RAM for Apple Mac Mini</a>? I compare ram prices from reputable memory stores only (and have for over 14 years) so you won’t find any shady memory resllers.

    <h1><a href="/2011/01/where-can-i-sell-old-ram/">Where Can I Sell Old RAM?</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>If you buy any new computer, regardless of make or brand  – be it a Dell, Apple, HP or other computer manufacturer when it comes time to upgrade your notebook or desktop computer you usually have to replace the factory installed memory upgrade with larger sized memory upgrade modules to add more memory to your computer</p>

<div style="float: right; margin-right: 5px;">
</div>

<p>Unless you buy your computer direct from the factory and with the maximum memory installed you will want to, or need to replace your memory that is already in your computer for a larger memory upgrade chip. One way to offset the cost of  a memory upgrade for your computer is to sell the factory ram to a memory reseller or manufacturer where they can still use the parts and individual chips on the memory board for the manufacture of larger memory upgrades in the future.</p>

<p>This leaves you asking:** “where can I sell old RAM”? **and it’s a good question as some, not all memory manufacturers will buy back your memory but I do know of a few placesa that will be happy to buy your RAM that was previously installed in your computer:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Sell the RAM yourself</strong>. This could effectively gain you the highest price possible if you were to decide to sell old ram in this manner. <a href="http://www.ebay.com">Ebay</a> and <a href="http://www.craigslist.org">Craigslist</a> are two such websites where you could get paid cash for your old memory or ram upgrades</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>**Sell the RAM back to the computer memory manufacturer **at the same time as you buy new ram. Essentially working the same way as trade-in on a car purchase works, you trade in your old ram and use the funds from the old ram against your new memory buy.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p> **Sell the RAM back to a memory store or manufacturer that is different **from where you buy your new memory upgrades</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The Apple MacBook Pro is a fantastic computer, no doubt about it. I have, and use one and have stuck with Apple notebook computers since the PowerBook 165c (which I paid something silly like $5000 for back in the day).</p>

<p>But the Apple MacBook needs one thing to run at the maximum speed this computer is capable of and that’s the fact that adding more memory to your MacBook Pro will increase the performance and offer the best bang for buck than any other upgrade possible you could get for your Apple Notebook. Adding and installing more memory in your Apple MacBook Pro is better than buying USB flash drives, installing software, adding a bigger hard drive in your MacBook Pro (this might be the 2nd best upgrade you could do) or anything else you might think makes your MacBook Pro run faster and well, better.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I"><img title="Best Price MacBook Pro" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-24-at-7.39.14-AM.png" alt="See Best Price on MacBook Pro" width="283" height="223" /></a></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I">Best Price on MacBook Pro</a></strong></p>

<p>One question I get asked is a lot is:** Is all MacBook Memory is the same**?.</p>

<p>The answer is No. What you’re looking for when buying memory for your MacBook Pro is</p>

<ol>
  <li>Price.</li>
  <li>Quality</li>
  <li>Support</li>
</ol>

<p>Chances are you’re here because you want the best price on MacBook Pro RAM you can find, and you’re not alone – I compare MacBook Pro RAM Prices for both individual modules and MacBook Pro memory upgrade kits, so it only makes sense that you want to spend less and get more when you’re ready to <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com">buy MacBook Pro RAM</a>.</p>

<p>But price is only one part of the equation. I’d put quality at the top of the list instead.  Who wants to buy crappy ram? I don’t, and I don’t track memory store prices from memory vendors that do. Quality to me means that RAM for your MacBook Pro is built with high quality parts to the exact specifications that Apple requires for Apple MacBook memory. And that’s what you should be looking for when ram shopping. Not the best ram  price, quality ram priced right.</p>

<p>Lastly, (and I’m a huge fan of this)  is support. Without this, you’re dead in the water. You want to buy memory from  a memory store you can trust that in the rare case you do have MacBook Pro RAM problems you can return the memory knowing that the store you bought the MacBook Pro memory will stand behind the product and help you resolve your issue if the case needs it.</p>

<p>**Where and What MacBook Pro Memory **to Buy is really up to you to decide, but I can <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="recommended memory stores">recommend memory stores</a> that are established and can be trusted to help you when you’re ready to buy MacBook Pro Memory Upgrades</p>

<p>The  Apple iMac is a very popular desktop computer from Apple and one way to better the performance of Apple’s best selling desktop computer is to add more memory and now with the latest iMac models being able to recognize 16GB of RAM the 4GB memory upgrade for Apple iMacs is a very popular memory upgrade here on ramseeker. One of the most popular memory upgrades we sell in fact, only bested by the more popular Apple notebook computers such as the MacBook and MacBook Pros</p>

<p>[table id=2 /]</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8IO6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8IO6">Cheapest Apple iMac</a></strong></p>

<p>4GB RAM for iMac can be bought for many different Apple iMac models and depending on the specific iMac model you are looking to upgrade the price and also the memory type that your particular Apple iMac requires could be different.</p>

<p>Currently shipping iMacs are the most popular Apple computers to upgrade and they require the newer 1333MHz SDRAM memory upgrades. Available as either a <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/iMac_(DDR3_1333)-4gb/">4GB 1333Mhz memory module</a> or as a <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/iMac_KITS_(DDR3_1333)-4gb/">4GB 1333Mhz memory upgrade kit</a> which will be the cheaper of the two choices.</p>

<p>Just discontinued Apple iMacs this summer 2010 used the older DDR3 memory standard running at 1066Mhz which also require and can accept <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/iMac_KITS_(DDR3_1066)/">4GB memory modules for iMac</a> as well as <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/iMac_KITS_(DDR3_1066)-4gb/">4GB memory upgrade kits for iMac</a>.</p>

<p>Older iMacs that require either <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/iMac_(PC2_6400)/">DDR2 PC6400 SDRAM </a> or even <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/iMac_(PC5300)/">PC5300 DDR2 SDRAM</a> may  be able to accept 4GB for Apple iMac, but this will depend on your specific model of iMac, as some older Apple iMacs could only accept 2GB of RAM. <a href="http://www.lowendmac.com">Low End Mac</a> and <a href="http://www.everymac.com">Every Mac</a> are two resources that I always refer to when  checking  the memory upgrade specifications  of now discontinued Apple computers.</p>

<p>4GB RAM is the newest ram available for Apple iMac but is now an affordable upgrade option for those looking to either upgrade a new or even older Apple iMac computer today.</p>

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>I think adding or even maximizing memory on any computer is worth it, regardless of whether it’s a MacBook Pro, Macbook, iMac or any other Apple computer on sale today. All Apple models (and most PC models too) can benefit from a memory upgrade, and especially the MacBook Pro.</p>

<p>[table id=1 /]<br />

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1149" title="Cheapest MacBook Pro" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-24-at-7.39.14-AM1.png" alt="Best MacBook Pro Price" width="283" height="223" /></a></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I">Best MacBook Pro Deals</a></strong></p>

<p>With the MacBook, one could argue that for most MacBook users, the 2GB of RAM that these consumer notebooks ship with from the factory is enough ram for most general computing needs such as email, web, facebook and Apple’s applications that ship with the Apple MacBook at no extra charge and they would be right. You can do just fine with 2GB of RAM on an Apple MacBook.</p>

<p>But a MacBook Pro is a different story. This is a professional grade notebook computer from Apple that offers added expansion ports, faster processor, and more memory expansion opportunities than what’s possible with the lesser MacBook model. Why would you not want to run your very expensive apple notebook computer as fast as you possibly can?</p>

<p>Maxing out the Memory on a MacBook Pro is the most cost effective upgrade you can do for this Apple notebook. At time of writing this, <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_Pro_KITS_(1066_DDR3)/">Apple MacBook Pro 8GB RAM</a> sells for as little as $110.00. Assuming you maximize your new and current MacBook Pro to the full 8GB and keep your professional notebook for one year, the macbook ram upgrade works out to a little over $9.00 a month. What other way can you spend so little money to make you work faster? We’re talking 30 cents a day to upgrade your MacBook Pro so it will run faster, open more applications and just run smoother overall.</p>

<p>To summarize – yes, I think <strong>upgrading the MacBook Pro RAM is worth it.</strong> RAM Upgrades are the best bargain in computing available today.</p>

<p>Yes and No.</p>

<p>You can <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/">buy memory online</a></strong> from a wide selection of memory sellers or stores who will be more than happy to sell you memory for cheap prices and offer you a lifetime warranty on the memory upgrade and give you support if you need it, but RAM is a physical product that you insert into your desktop or notebook computer to enhance speed and performance of your computer, regardless of make.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004Q3R9BK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004Q3R9BK">Cheap Flash Memory</a></strong></p>

<p>What you cannot do is add memory online as if RAM or memory were some kind of software or other free download. You can <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">buy memory</a> but it has to be shipped to you just as you would order a book from Amazon or <a href="http://www.americanflower.org">Flowers for Delivery</a> you buy the memory, wait for it to arrive and then follow instructions on how to install memory for your desktop or notebook computer.</p>

<p><strong>Where To Buy Computer Memory</strong><br />
I have created a list of trusted and respected memory stores that I can recommend that will be happy to sell you a memory upgrade, and except for rare instances the memory upgrade you buy from these online memory stores will be much cheaper than if you were to buy memory from the manufacturer of your computer. It’s quite easy and possible to save up to half price on memory without much trouble at all by visiting the memory stores and and noting the lowest price from each memory reseller or manufacturer.</p>

<p>If this sounds like a heck of a lot of work to go to each memory store and check the price for you notebook (desktops seem to be less popular these days) it is, but I have taken the opportunity to do the work for you and offer ram prices compared from a list of respectable memory stores that offer the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com">best ram prices</a> as well as the customer support you would expect and deserve.</p>

<p>RAM Memory is cheap. Especially if you buy RAM or Memory online and have it shipped to you where you can install it yourself with nothing more than some household tools you already have. But you have to buy the memory first.</p>

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p><strong>Cheapest Notebook Memory Prices<br />
**<br />
When shopping for ram, and in my experience in tracking ram prices for close to fifteen years I essentially answer one question each and every day: “</strong>Who has the cheapest memory**?”</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VNKNF0/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B003VNKNF0">Cheapest Memory Upgrades</a></strong></p>

<p>In an internet and smartphone driven world, it’s easy in 2011 to enter a search term and find what you are looking for and when shopping for memory upgrades, the memory store with the lowest price on ram usually gets the sale.</p>

<p>But low price does not mean good price sometimes, which is why I only track and monitor ram prices from memory vendors or memory stores that are actually reputable and stand behind the products they sell by offering a no questions asked warranty and friendly and reliable customer service. It’s long been my stance to just monitor the ram prices from these memory stores and not recommend one specific memory reseller over another. I do have an option to sort by ram price, which allows you to decide where you want to spend your money on ram upgrades and I do have a section on lowest ram prices where you can see the cheapest ram prices from all memory stores.</p>

<p>But it’s my opinion that Cheapest RAM and Best RAM are two different things: the cheapest ram is just that – the lowest priced generic memory you can buy. The best ram is the memory upgrade you buy from a store you are comfortable with and trust. This could be the Apple Store, (definitely not the cheapest memory) or any of the honest memory stores I list. If you want the cheapest RAM, go to <a href="http://www.craigslist.com">craigslist</a> or <a href="http://www.ebay.com">ebay</a> or <a href="http://www.kijiji.com">kijiji</a> and find some ram. Maybe you’ll get a bargain, and maybe you won’t and the memory you buy will not work, shut down your computer or worse. But it was cheap, right?</p>

<p>Forget the cheapest memory and go with the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="best memory you can buy">best memory you can buy</a>. You’ll be happier with your purchase over the long time you use and  own your desktop computer</p>

		<div class="post-content"><p><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com">Ram Prices drop over time</a>. When first introduced <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">new memory modules</a> are very expensive to buy, and in some cases the memory upgrades can cost as much as the computer the ram upgrade is designed to be compatible with.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MX5YWI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001MX5YWI"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1276" title="Cheapest Computer RAM Prices" alt="Best Priced Computer RAM" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Screen-shot-2011-03-25-at-12.34.11-PM.png" width="522" height="208" /></a></p>

<p>One example of this recently is the newer Mac Pro Computers that were released earlier this summer in 2010. When first introduced to add 64gb of RAM to a Apple Mac Pro would cost you just shy of $3000, but in the last six months the ram prices for Apple Mac Pro have dropped and at time of writing this article are now priced at a much more affordable (yet still pretty pricey) $1900. You save $1000 on your memory upgrades just by waiting for time and demand to increase which of course, reduces the price.</p>

<p>Another example of this would be when the iMac DDR3 models were released in 2008. To buy ram from Apple at the time it would cost you as much as the iMac itself to upgrade to the 8GB of RAM that the Apple iMacs could handle, but in 2011 ram upgrades for the same Apple iMac computers are now a much more affordable and cost just $110 for 8GB of DDR3 memory for the same computer. That’s a 90% ram price change in just a few years.</p>

<p>So if you want to <strong>save money on ram upgrades,</strong> one option is to just wait as the ram price trends do indicate year over year that except for rare instances, memory upgrade prices drop over time regardless of whether you need memory for an Apple Computer or Dell or HP computer as well the cheapest RAM is the memory you don’t buy today but make do with the standard ram that is already installed in your notebook or desktop computer. Most computers today come with enough memory for most consumer based tasks such as facebook, email, web browsing and so forth. If you’re a power computer or earn your living with your computer then it’s probably best to buy ram today regardless of cost as over time you will benefit from the memory upgrade and ignore any ram price trends.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="what is the cost of memory">What is the cost of memory?</a></strong> That’s the number 1 question I answer day in and day out here on ramseeker as this is all I do – track and monitor ram and memory upgrade prices from reputable third part vendors.</p>

<p>But if you think about it and save for the fewer higher end applications that require 32GB of RAM or more, memory upgrades are so cheap that the default thing to do when you get a new computer is to fill it with ram.</p>

<p>Let’s take the MacBook as an example:  Depending on where you buy your MacBook from the price will be about $1000 for a new MacBook today. RAM prices to completely fill your MacBook with memory, replacing the factory memory (which you can sell for even further price reductions) will cost you just under $50. That’s 1/20th the cost of the computer you want to upgrade or about the same price as a dinner out for two.</p>

<p>But for the $50 ram upgrade you get the performance you deserve from your thousand dollar purchase for your MacBook that you paid for as with a maxed out MacBook (or any computer for that matter) you benefit from faster application launch times, more applications open at the same time and an overall feel that your very expensive notebook is just overall a faster mac with the maximum ram installed when compared to the performance you get with  the memory configuration directly from Apple.</p>

<p>The best part is that a year or so from now or whenever you are ready to upgrade your next computer, ram prices will continue to drop, or at very least the memory module size will get bigger so you get more gigabytes for the same memory upgrade dollar.</p>

<p>Considering how cheap ram has become over the years, I can strongly suggest you max out the memory on your computer. RAM is so cheap right now.</p>
