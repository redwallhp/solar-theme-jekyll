If there&#8217;s one popular computer when it comes to [RAM Prices][1] (or if you prefer, memory prices) it&#8217;s the MacBook Pro.  Desktop computers do have their applications and usually offer more value in speed, upgradeability and  in some cases as the Apple iMac &#8211; screen size &#8211; it&#8217;s the notebook computers from Apple that really offer the best value whether you choose the budget oriented MacBook or the faster MacBook Pro that offers more expandability options as well.

[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1149" title="Cheapest MacBook Pro" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-24-at-7.39.14-AM1.png" alt="Best MacBook Pro Price" width="283" height="223" />][2]

**[Cheapest MacBook Pro][2]**

One of the best expandability options on the MacBook Pro is the option to add more RAM memory (RAM and Memory should be considered interchangeable when it comes to this article).

The newest Apple MacBook models (which aren&#8217;t that new &#8211; there&#8217;s a a MacBook Pro refresh needed in 2011)  allow for a maximum of 8GB DDR3 SDRAM sodimms to be installed replacing what is usually installed from the factory: 2x2GB memory modules for  a total of 4GB MacBook Pro RAM that ships standard with your MacBook Pro.

But to get the maximum performance from your professional Apple notebook computer, I recommend you max out your MBP to the 8GB allowable. 8GB for the MacBook Pro costs just over $100 at time of writing &#8211; a far cry from the $1000 it cost just a few short years ago, making a 8GB RAM Upgrade for MacBook Pro one of the better upgrades you can achieve this year to increase your computing performance.

**Where to Buy MacBook Pro Memory**

<span style="color: #000000;">I have been tracking RAM Prices on MacBook Pro memory starting with the DDR2 memory the older MacBook Pro&#8217;s  required and now with the newer and faster MacBook Pros that use the DDR3 RAM instead and I prefer to leave it to you to decide where to buy MacBook Pro RAM rather than push one particular store.  The lowest price on MacBook Pro Memory is just one factor when considering buying RAM for Apple but below is a table listing current and lowest ram prices for MacBook Pro: </span>

<br>

		<div class="post-content">&nbsp;

The short answer:  not much at all. [RAM is cheap][1] and you should, if you can afford to &#8211; max out the RAM on your Apple Computer.  
[table id=15 /]MacBook Pro Memory is just one of the most popular Apple upgrades you can buy today.

&nbsp;

**[Best RAM for Apple Notebooks][2]**

The longer answer to this question is: it depends on what computer you want to add more memory to, be it an Apple iMac, Apple MacBook, Apple MacBook Pro or Apple Mac Pro as they all require different memory upgrades depending on what specific Apple Computer you are looking to upgrade.

For this article, we&#8217;re going to talk about currently shipping [Apple Computers on sale][3] and we&#8217;ll cover the discontinued Apple computers in the future.

For the Apple iMac it will [cost you as little as $52 for a 4GB memory upgrade][4] module. Assuming the Apple iMac can accept 16GB , you will need to buy four 4gb memory modules for iMac which would bring your total up to just over $200 at today&#8217;s memory prices for Apple iMac

With the professional desktop from Apple &#8211; the Apple Mac Pro, this is where it gets really interesting as depending on which current Apple Mac Pro you have you might require DDR3 1066Mhz or DDR3 1333MHz sodimm memory upgrades. And as there&#8217;s  lots of room for memory upgrades inside a Mac Pro you could [drop almost $2000 to fill your Mac Pro with memory][5] up to the Maximum 64GB of RAM the latest Mac Pro models can recognize

The tiny desktop Mac, the Mac Mini use DDR3 1066Mhz sodimms and can accept up to 8GB of DDR3 SDRAM so to max out your new Apple Mac Mini you would need to [buy 4GB x 2][6] to get the full performance from Apple&#8217;s tiniest desktop computer made to date costing you a bit over $100 with two 4GB Mac Mini RAM upgrades

On the notebook side, Both the Apple MacBook and Apple MacBook Pro accept the same type of RAM: The DDR3 SDRAM 1066Mhz sodimms, the difference between the two models being the maximum amounts of memory the two different MacBook models can accept. On the MacBook, 4GB of RAM is the maximum so the [cost would be as little as $50][7] and for the MacBook Pro&#8217;s which can accept up to 8GB of RAM, the cost doubles to just a tad [over $100 to fill your MacBook Pro with the most memory possible][8].

<br>

		<div class="post-content">**[Cheap Apple iMacs On Sale][1]**

[table id=2 /]DDR3 RAM for iMac has been the default memory type for the popular Apple desktop computer for some time now. Until earlier this summer the Apple iMacs used and required only one type of DDR3 RAM : DDR3 1066MHz SDRAM so-dimms.

But with the release of the newest Apple iMacs in the summer of 2010, Apple introduced a new memory requirement that not only used faster ram speed than prior iMacs but also allowed the iMac to use and recognize up to 16GB of RAM.

DDR3 1333MHz memory upgrades are what is required for the newest Apple iMacs when it comes to memory upgrades for Apple&#8217;s latest computer.

Buying DDR3 memory from Apple, in my opinion is not a good way to save your hard earned money and you can do better on the price if you buy either generic or even name brand memory for the Apple iMacs from a [trusted third party memory store][2].

DDR3 memory price for Apple iMac continue to drop in price over time, and just about two years ago, upgrading your Apple iMac to 8GB would  cost you as much as the desktop itself. But as the DDR3 RAM technology becomes more popular the prices for DDR3 RAM just get cheaper and cheaper.

**DDR3 RAM Prices for iMac**

<span style="color: #000000;">I monitor both DDR3 1066MHz and DDR3 1333Mhz memory upgrades in both memory upgrade kit form as some memory stores prefer to market the RAM for iMacs in this fashion as there&#8217;s a good chance you will buy 2 or more iMac memory modules to install at the same time to maximize your iMac&#8217;s memory. But I also list DDR3 iMac RAM prices for individual memory uprades for  iMac as well. I suggest you check both to get the best deal on your DDR3 RAM upgrade purchase.</span>

**[Best RAM for Black MacBook][1]**

[  
][2]The [Black MacBooks][3] are now a long discontinued [Apple notebook computer][4] being replaced by  a much less fingerprint prone white MacBook but I always thought the Black  MacBooks looked much cooler than the white MacBooks or even the silver [MacBook Pros currently on sale][5].

It&#8217;s been a few years since the Black MacBook models were available so it should come as no surprise that these MacBook models take and accept  less RAM than the more modern unibody MacBook models available today.

As far as [Maximum RAM for the Black MacBooks][6], the answer to this question will depend on the source. According to Apple the Black MacBooks can accept and use up to 4Gb on the later 2008 models, but some memory vendors claim to be able to run 6GB of black macbook memory without trouble, but it&#8217;s always been my policy to tow the company line and  stick to the maximum memory upgrades as quoted by Apple. Your mileage may vary&#8230;

For older MacBook models in black, the maximum memory was a paltry 2GB (when compared to today&#8217;s 4GB maximum) of [PC2 5300 DD2 SDRAM sodimms][7] that the black macbook requires to run.  Again, some memory stores claimed 3GB would  work in the black macbooks thanks to 2GB installed in one of the two memory upgrade slots available for upgrade but again, Apple says it will take 2GB maximum, so this is the maximum amount I suggest. To do so, you will have to replace the smaller sized factory memory (usually 2x512mb)  and install 1GB x 2 for a maximum of 2GB on the black MacBook models.

When shopping for [MacBook Pro Memory ][1] it can be a good idea to shop for memory upgrade kits for MacBook Pro as some memory stores offer memory upgrade kits that include two MacBook Pro memory upgrade modules.

Usually, these memory upgrade kits make sense to buy as you usually save money on MacBook Pro ram as you will need to buy two memory modules anyway if you want to maximize the ram on your MacBook Pro and 8GB kits for MacBook Pro is the most memory you can install in MacBook Pros in 2010 (and 2011 so far, but my guess is this  will change with new MacBook models being announced soon enough).

The good news is 8GB RAM upgrades for MacBook Pro in kit form (4GB x 2) have dropped in price considerably when compared to just over a year ago where you would pay almost as much as the cost of the Apple computer itself just to Max out the RAM.

At time of writing this you can buy 8GB RAM for MacBook Pro for as little as $<del>110</del>, $40.00 which when you amortize the cost over a year &#8211; a reasonable time to use the same notebook computer, the cost add the most RAM to your MacBook Pro works out to less than $1.00 per day. For that money spent with your 8GB DDR3 RAM purchase you get a faster, smoother running Apple professional notebook that can mean you get your work done faster than if you had not upgraded your memory.

The prices for 8GB for MacBook Pros change constantly. Below is a table of the cheapest RAM prices for  MacBook Pro that gets updated continually, and includes other memory upgrades as well as just 8GB kits for MacBook Pro

I&#8217;ll start this article by offering advice on where not to [buy Mac Mini RAM][1], and that&#8217;s from [Apple][2] directly. The good folks at Apple do a great job at making many great products and there&#8217;s no doubt that I&#8217;m an Apple fan, but when it comes to selling RAM, you will not find the cheapest ram at our favorite fruit company.

**[Cheapest Apple Computer][3]**

Where you will find [great deals on Mac Mini RAM][4] to buy is right here as I have been tracking and monitoring memory prices since 1997 which is longer than well, anyone &#8211; and over the years I have created a chart which compares Apple Mac Mini RAM upgrades for whatever Mac Mini you are looking to upgrade:

[The first Mac Mini requires PC27000 DDR RAM][5]

The second series of Mac Mini uses PC5300 DDR SDRAM and is marketed as both [Mac Mini memory upgrade kits][6] or by [individual Mac Mini PC5300 memory modules][7].

The latest and newest Apple Mac Minis to be released require DDR3 SDRAM and [Mac Mini DDR3 memory][8] and [Mac Mini DDR3 memory upgrade kits][9] are available to purchase for Apple&#8217;s smallest and cheapest Apple computer available today.

Now that we have determined the different Mac Mini models and what memory modules you will need to buy the next question is [where to buy RAM for Apple Mac Mini][10]? I compare ram prices from reputable memory stores only (and have for over 14 years) so you won&#8217;t find any shady memory resllers. What you will find is quality ram for your Mac Mini at competitive prices and all from Memory stores you can trust to deliver quality memory upgrades right to your door which you can [install yourself][11] thanks to instructions for Mac Mini memory installation directly from Apple.

   <B> <h1><a href="/2011/01/where-can-i-sell-old-ram/">Where Can I Sell Old RAM?</a></h1></B>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content">If you buy any new computer, regardless of make or brand  &#8211; be it a Dell, Apple, HP or other computer manufacturer when it comes time to upgrade your notebook or desktop computer you usually have to replace the factory installed memory upgrade with larger sized memory upgrade modules to add more memory to your computer

<div style="float: right; margin-right: 5px;">
</div>

Unless you buy your computer direct from the factory and with the maximum memory installed you will want to, or need to replace your memory that is already in your computer for a larger memory upgrade chip. One way to offset the cost of  a memory upgrade for your computer is to sell the factory ram to a memory reseller or manufacturer where they can still use the parts and individual chips on the memory board for the manufacture of larger memory upgrades in the future.

This leaves you asking:** &#8220;where can I sell old RAM&#8221;? **and it&#8217;s a good question as some, not all memory manufacturers will buy back your memory but I do know of a few placesa that will be happy to buy your RAM that was previously installed in your computer:

  1. **Sell the RAM yourself**. This could effectively gain you the highest price possible if you were to decide to sell old ram in this manner. [Ebay][1] and [Craigslist][2] are two such websites where you could get paid cash for your old memory or ram upgrades

  2. **Sell the RAM back to the computer memory manufacturer **at the same time as you buy new ram. Essentially working the same way as trade-in on a car purchase works, you trade in your old ram and use the funds from the old ram against your new memory buy.

  3.  **Sell the RAM back to a memory store or manufacturer that is different **from where you buy your new memory upgrades

The Apple MacBook Pro is a fantastic computer, no doubt about it. I have, and use one and have stuck with Apple notebook computers since the PowerBook 165c (which I paid something silly like $5000 for back in the day).

But the Apple MacBook needs one thing to run at the maximum speed this computer is capable of and that&#8217;s the fact that adding more memory to your MacBook Pro will increase the performance and offer the best bang for buck than any other upgrade possible you could get for your Apple Notebook. Adding and installing more memory in your Apple MacBook Pro is better than buying USB flash drives, installing software, adding a bigger hard drive in your MacBook Pro (this might be the 2nd best upgrade you could do) or anything else you might think makes your MacBook Pro run faster and well, better.

[<img title="Best Price MacBook Pro" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-24-at-7.39.14-AM.png" alt="See Best Price on MacBook Pro" width="283" height="223" />][1]

**[Best Price on MacBook Pro][1]**

One question I get asked is a lot is:** Is all MacBook Memory is the same**?.

The answer is No. What you&#8217;re looking for when buying memory for your MacBook Pro is

  1. Price.
  2. Quality
  3. Support

Chances are you&#8217;re here because you want the best price on MacBook Pro RAM you can find, and you&#8217;re not alone &#8211; I compare MacBook Pro RAM Prices for both individual modules and MacBook Pro memory upgrade kits, so it only makes sense that you want to spend less and get more when you&#8217;re ready to [buy MacBook Pro RAM][2].

But price is only one part of the equation. I&#8217;d put quality at the top of the list instead.  Who wants to buy crappy ram? I don&#8217;t, and I don&#8217;t track memory store prices from memory vendors that do. Quality to me means that RAM for your MacBook Pro is built with high quality parts to the exact specifications that Apple requires for Apple MacBook memory. And that&#8217;s what you should be looking for when ram shopping. Not the best ram  price, quality ram priced right.

Lastly, (and I&#8217;m a huge fan of this)  is support. Without this, you&#8217;re dead in the water. You want to buy memory from  a memory store you can trust that in the rare case you do have MacBook Pro RAM problems you can return the memory knowing that the store you bought the MacBook Pro memory will stand behind the product and help you resolve your issue if the case needs it.

**Where and What MacBook Pro Memory **to Buy is really up to you to decide, but I can [recommend memory stores][3] that are established and can be trusted to help you when you&#8217;re ready to buy MacBook Pro Memory Upgrades

The  Apple iMac is a very popular desktop computer from Apple and one way to better the performance of Apple&#8217;s best selling desktop computer is to add more memory and now with the latest iMac models being able to recognize 16GB of RAM the 4GB memory upgrade for Apple iMacs is a very popular memory upgrade here on ramseeker. One of the most popular memory upgrades we sell in fact, only bested by the more popular Apple notebook computers such as the MacBook and MacBook Pros

**[Cheapest Apple iMac][1]**

4GB RAM for iMac can be bought for many different Apple iMac models and depending on the specific iMac model you are looking to upgrade the price and also the memory type that your particular Apple iMac requires could be different.

Currently shipping iMacs are the most popular Apple computers to upgrade and they require the newer 1333MHz SDRAM memory upgrades. Available as either a [4GB 1333Mhz memory module][2] or as a [4GB 1333Mhz memory upgrade kit][3] which will be the cheaper of the two choices.

Just discontinued Apple iMacs this summer 2010 used the older DDR3 memory standard running at 1066Mhz which also require and can accept [4GB memory modules for iMac][4] as well as [4GB memory upgrade kits for iMac][5].

Older iMacs that require either [DDR2 PC6400 SDRAM ][6] or even [PC5300 DDR2 SDRAM][7] may  be able to accept 4GB for Apple iMac, but this will depend on your specific model of iMac, as some older Apple iMacs could only accept 2GB of RAM. [Low End Mac][8] and [Every Mac][9] are two resources that I always refer to when  checking  the memory upgrade specifications  of now discontinued Apple computers.

4GB RAM is the newest ram available for Apple iMac but is now an affordable upgrade option for those looking to either upgrade a new or even older Apple iMac computer today.

<br>

		<div class="post-content">I think adding or even maximizing memory on any computer is worth it, regardless of whether it&#8217;s a MacBook Pro, Macbook, iMac or any other Apple computer on sale today. All Apple models (and most PC models too) can benefit from a memory upgrade, and especially the MacBook Pro.

[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1149" title="Cheapest MacBook Pro" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-24-at-7.39.14-AM1.png" alt="Best MacBook Pro Price" width="283" height="223" />][1]

**[Best MacBook Pro Deals][1]**

With the MacBook, one could argue that for most MacBook users, the 2GB of RAM that these consumer notebooks ship with from the factory is enough ram for most general computing needs such as email, web, facebook and Apple&#8217;s applications that ship with the Apple MacBook at no extra charge and they would be right. You can do just fine with 2GB of RAM on an Apple MacBook.

But a MacBook Pro is a different story. This is a professional grade notebook computer from Apple that offers added expansion ports, faster processor, and more memory expansion opportunities than what&#8217;s possible with the lesser MacBook model. Why would you not want to run your very expensive apple notebook computer as fast as you possibly can?

Maxing out the Memory on a MacBook Pro is the most cost effective upgrade you can do for this Apple notebook. At time of writing this, [Apple MacBook Pro 8GB RAM][2] sells for as little as $110.00. Assuming you maximize your new and current MacBook Pro to the full 8GB and keep your professional notebook for one year, the macbook ram upgrade works out to a little over $9.00 a month. What other way can you spend so little money to make you work faster? We&#8217;re talking 30 cents a day to upgrade your MacBook Pro so it will run faster, open more applications and just run smoother overall.

To summarize &#8211; yes, I think **upgrading the MacBook Pro RAM is worth it.** RAM Upgrades are the best bargain in computing available today.
