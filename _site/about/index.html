    <div id="content">
      <p>I have been blowing off writing this about page for fifteen years, because I really don’t like talking about myself and most of  these profiles and about pages I read are kind of useless anyway.</p>

<h3 id="but-here-we-are">But, here we are.</h3>

<p>I started ramseeker as a hobby site back in 1997 when geocities and AOL disks were a thing, and Google was that new search engine you should try.</p>

<p>I am closing in on comparing ram prices for Apple computers for almost twenty years now, but I doubt that this will continue much further as newer and newer computers from Apple are shipping with soldered in RAM that is not upgradeable. There’s a good chance that if you bought your computer after 2012 you won’t be able to upgrade the ram.</p>

<p>This has been happening for quite some time and now there are more models in <a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple’s current lineup</a> that don’t take a memory upgrade than those that do. But there’s still a lot of older Macs out there still in circulation and ram is pretty cheap still compared to a decade ago when a ram upgrade costs upwards or even over a thousand dollars for 1GB.</p>

<p>Now you’re hard pressed to spend $100 on a 8gb ram upgrade, and this is a good thing. <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com"><strong>RAM is now cheap. </strong></a></p>

<p>When I started ramseeker.com I never thought it would have been as popular as it was in the early 2000’s when adding more RAM mattered a lot more than it did today with newer and newer operating systems that have been designed to sip the stuff compared to old OS’s of the day.  <strong>In 2015, 16GB of RAM is all you will ever need.</strong></p>

<h3 id="so-now-what">So, now what? </h3>

<p>I could sell this site, but I’m kind of fond of it.</p>

<p>Like Dan at <a href="http://www.lowendmac.com">Low End Mac</a>, ramseeker.com has seen better days (and a lot more ads and traffic) and now is just a hobby site once again for the most part because ram prices don’t change that much and there’s not the demand there once was.</p>

<p>And this leaves me with today: I am going to start writing more and more here on ramseeker. In the past year or so there really hasn’t been much new happening here and I want that to change and add more content to the site. I think that content is the future for this site and  sadly the current state of the content is both sad and few.</p>

<p>I will probably still write about tech and Apple because both topics are true to my heart, but there’s been other topics I want to write about too, and I plan on spending a lot more time writing about mobile or other modern topics rather than one more article about the advantages of a ram upgrade (hint - your Mac will love you for it)</p>

<p>I am hoping that over time my writing will get better as I find my ‘voice’, whatever that may be. I’m days away from entering my 50th year on this planet and one thing I want to do  on my bucket list is write more and I might as well do it here rather than start fresh with a brand new site.</p>

<p>As I write this, I have no idea on the topics I will write about, but I can tell you I don’t really want to become a <a href="http://www.dealnews.com">deal site</a> or a <a href="http://www.macintouch.com">news site</a>. I don’t want to be glued to my computer like I once was and both of  these topics have been done for a very long time by folks much better than I could ever do.</p>

<p>But I have some thoughts and ideas for articles I want to write and I may just sprinkle in some news I find interesting and deals that might interest you. I also want to start linking out to some sites in the Apple community. I feel that there’s not as much of this as there once was and if for no other reason I can write about the site or resource and then find it later here when I search for it.</p>

<p>Ultimately, with just 2 short years left until ramseeker’s 20th anniversary I would like to have this site offer more value.  My goal when I started ramseeker was not to make money but to help others save money on RAM and I think I have done very well with this task.</p>

<p>The next goal will see if I can write well enough to garner any sort of regular audience. It’s been said that you’re a success if you have 1000 true fans. With the back button just a click away and so many devices and distractions in your every day, this will be quite the task to attract a few eyeballs with my words, let alone 1000.</p>
