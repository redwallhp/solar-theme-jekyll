        <title>Used ThinkPad Buyers Guide</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve had a few thinkpads over the past year and have pretty much tested every model (so far I’ve settled a ThinkPad T530) but if you’re sick of spending the Apple tax these are very nice computers for the price. $200 or even less can get you a very nice computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Used ThinkPad Buyers Guide&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Last updated 9 July 2016&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This Buyers guide covers ThinkPads new enough to fully support Windows 10 with all updates and costs under $500.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>Macintosh History from the 1980s</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;From a report on the MacWorld Expo in 1989: One of the most important developments&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Accelerator cards for the Mac, “believe it or not”. This was presumably one of the first time such cards &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be developed. Two prerequisites had been met: first, the debut of the “Open Mac” architecture of the Macintosh II a few years previously (March 1987), and secondly a processor advancement (from the 68020 that shipped in the II, to the 68030 in the IIx and SE/30.) Of course, previous closed Macs such as the Plus could be upgraded with special clip-on chips which boosted clock speeds, but 1989 was the first year that accelerators could be introduced based on the Apple-approved NuBus boards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we’ve come full circle and uprading any recent Mac is pretty much impossible once again&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a fun site. If nothing else, vist it for the design.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Simplenote</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I keep on switching back and forth between simplenote and evernote. At times, evernote seems like too much when I all I want to do is to just cut and paste some code or text I want to remember later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is available for Linux, and that’s something that evernote is note so this maces this one of the better cross platform notes available. 
&amp;gt; The simplest way to keep notes.
&amp;gt; Light, clean, and free. Simplenote is now available for iOS, Android, Mac, Windows, Linux, and the web.
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Sick of dealing with hosting companies? GitHub Pages are powered by Jekyll, so you can easily deploy your site using GitHub for free—custom domain name and all.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Sean Cleary&#39;s Duo Dock/Tick of Death Page</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I always had a soft spot for the Duo and back in the day could only afford the grayscale versions as the color was too rich for my blood. But, I did at one time own a duo dock and I always thought it was a great idea to dock your notebook to a bigger desktop when you got back to the office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But these older Duo docks tend to fail after a while:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Typical Symptoms&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;There is a periodic ticking from the dock, particularly after periods of being unplugged.
This can become more frequent. In mild cases, the ticking will go away after the dock has been plugged in for an hour or two. In other cases, the dock ticks just after the Duo is ejected and may continue ticking for a while.
Eventually, the dock becomes useless as it ticks instead of working. If the Duo is stuck inside, and won’t eject, you may need to take the lid off to get it out. To do that, thin screwdrivers will be needed to press on the tabs since the Duo is in the way. Or you can wait and hope the ticking goes away and the Dock comes back to life for proper ejection.
Avoiding having the dock unplugged seems to postpone the inevitable degeneration to uselessness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The instructions on this page will get your old Duo dock up and running again:&lt;/p&gt;
