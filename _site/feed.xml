        <title>The Macintosh Clone Era | Low End Mac</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Maybe a Macintosh Clone wasn’t such a good idea after all…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The first thing that happened was clone makers developing Mac OS computers that ran faster than Apple’s computers while costing less – the 110 MHz Radius System 100 in March 1995 when Apple’s fastest was the 100 MHz Power Mac 8100, the 120 MHz Power Computing Power 120 a month later, the 150 MHz PowerWave in October 1995, the quad 132 MHz Daystar Genesis MP 528 (the first multiprocessor Mac) in October 1995 and quad 150 MHz MP 600 in February 1996, the 200 MHz Power Tower in April 1996, the 250 MHz Umax SuperMac S900 with a second CPU slot in August 1996, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>Where to Buy Ram - Ramjet</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.macmemory.com/pages/about-ramjet&quot;&gt;Ramjet.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As fellow Mac enthusiasts, we noticed a dearth of reliable upgrade products that meet or exceed Apple’s standards of quality and service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;That’s why in 1996, we launched Ramjet, a family-run company out of Champaign, Illinois, dedicated to helping do-it-yourself Mac lovers like us get the most performance and life out of their Macs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>Gabriel Google Docs Add-ON</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This little add-on changed my workflow. I can write in Google Docs and then published to my site hosted on github pages. I select the site I want to post to and the add-on takes care of the rest. It even adds images to the article or post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is a simple Google Apps ‘Add-On’ which converts a Google Doc to a text based format called Markdown. It adds a little metadata (in YAML format) about the document (e.g. a title, author, categories/tags) and commits it (together with any associated images) to a Github Repository (repo).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>Where to buy ram - Crucial Memory</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.crucial.com/usa/en/company-about&quot;&gt;Crucial.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Memory and storage are crucial – your system won’t work without them. Every time you press your system’s power button, load apps, save documents, stream content or virtualize databases, you’re using memory or storage. As a brand of Micron, one of the largest memory manufacturers in the world, we bring you the quality and expertise that’s been built into new computers for 35-plus years. You’ll notice the difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
