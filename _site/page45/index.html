Determining what [DDR3 RAM][1] you need for your Apple Macintosh computer is really not all that difficult as Apple lists technical specifications for all [current shipping Macs][2] on their website which will help you find the correct DDR3 memory for new Apple Computers such as Apple iMac, Apple MacBook Pro, Apple MacBook and Mac Pro and Mac Mini computer models.

If you&#8217;re looking to upgrade a now discontinued apple computer there&#8217;s a good chance that DDR3 memory is not the correct memory you need anyway, as except for a few recently discontinued Apple computers like the [discontinued Apple iMac][3] that until mid summer 2010 was a current Apple iMac model most older computers from Apple require either DDR1 or even just DDR memory to run. If you do need to upgrade RAM on non-DDR3 Apple computers I suggest you visit [Low End Mac][4] which has specifications on memory and more for every mac ever made.

Now that we&#8217;ve determined that you do need to [buy DDR3 RAM for Mac][5] the next question to get asked is where to buy Apple Memory and from whom? I&#8217;ve put together a little list of [Apple Memory Stores][6] where you can use to find a third party memory store that suits your needs when shopping for DDR3 RAM.

Usually, the next step after you have determined which DDR3 RAM you need and where you might like to buy DDR3 RAM from is price. It&#8217;s only natural to want to save money on memory upgrades, regardless of memory type and again, I have compiled some data on DDR3 RAM prices for Apple Computers:

Desktop memory, while not as popular a computer memory upgrade as it once might have been due to the popularity of notebooks, netbooks and even tablet computers such as the Apple iPad still can offer the most bang per computing dollar thanks to the design which in most cases, allow for faster processors, better cooling and larger displays than their portable counterparts.

[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1052" title="Cheapest Mac Mini" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-14-at-10.51.55-AM.png" alt="Best Deal Mac Mini" width="283" height="168" />][1]

**[Best Selling Desktop][1]: The Apple Mac Mini**

One of the **best upgrades for a desktop computer (**save perhaps for a processor) is to add more memory and fill your desktop computer with as much memory as possible &#8211; regardless of whether you built your own PC or are looking for more performance out of your factory desktop from computer manufacturers such as [Apple][2], [Dell][3], or [HP][4].

One of the first things you need to do when shopping for the [**best desktop ram upgrades**][5] is to determine what specific memory you need. If on a PC, many if not all memory stores and manufacturers offer a simple to use memory configurator that allows you to enter your processor or desktop computer model number or name into a form and the correct memory specifications will be returned to you.

Another option for determining the best ram for your desktop is to download a simple application that scans your computer for information relating to your model name, processor speed and in most cases this application will return specific part numbers for your desktop PC when it comes to memory upgrade requirements. [Crucial Technology][6] is just one memory store that offers this easy to download memory upgrade configurator.

Once you have determined the **memory upgrade you need**, the next step is to find the best price on desktop ram and I can recommend more than a few [memory stores][7] that offer competitive pricing on desktop memory where you can save significantly when it comes time to upgrade your desktop PC.

If theres&#8217;s one theme to ramseeker.com it&#8217;s the fact that with a few minutes of research on ram prices it&#8217;s quite possible to save up to 40% off when buying RAM when you compare the ram prices between third party memory stores like [MemoryX][1], [18004Memory][2], [OWC][3] and recently, [Crucial Technology][4] all offer much better and competitive pricing on memory upgrades than if you were to buy ram direct from the computer manufacturer such as [Apple][5],  [Dell][6], [HP][7] and so on&#8230;

The only reason I can think of why you might want to buy ram direct from the manufacturer of your computer is if  you were to configure the memory upgrade at the same time you bought your computer. You&#8217;ll pay for the convenience of doing so, but the benefit of doing this is you eliminate the cost and hassle of having to [buy memory online][8] and then installing the memory upgrade in your computer yourself. The downside of ordering or shopping for memory at the same time as buying your computer is the cost. You will pay more for memory. What you may gain in time and convenience, you will lose from your pocketbook.

If you&#8217;re like me and you want to buy quality memory upgrades at a better price that are still manufactured to the same exacting standards that the manufacturers demand for the memory upgrades that are compatible with  their specific computer models but without the high cost of memory that&#8217;s in most instances associated with buying ram direct from the manufacturer.

The solution to saving money when buying ram online is to buy ram from a trusted third party memory store. A memory store that except for a few rare cases, manufactures the memory they sell and offer the support and guarantee of the manufacturer branded memory upgrade, but without the high cost associated with the factory ram. When you compare ram prices and shop around for memory upgrades online you can [save up to 40% off ram upgrades][10] and buy memory that&#8217;s easy to install yourself but for much lesss money

**[  
Cheapest MacBook Pro][1]**

[  
][1]The Apple MacBook Pro is one of the most popular Apple computers currently on sale today thanks to the professional speed and performance today&#8217;s computer user demands but on thing that&#8217;s sorely missing on a new Apple notebook that costs over a thousand dollars at the very minimum is the fact that the MacBook Pro&#8217;s do not come direct from Apple with the maximum possible memory installed. (unless you configure your MacBook Pro from the Apple Store with the maximum ram already installed)

[table id=14 /]

To increase the performance of your MacBook Pro you need to, or I suggest that you do &#8211; add more ram. The newest MacBook Pro&#8217;s from Apple allow you to install 8GB of memory in them, and this is regardless of MacBook Pro screen size. 13, 15 and 17 inch MacBook Pro&#8217;s all max out at 8GB (my guess is the  2011 MacBook Pros will max out at 16GB, but at the time of writing, this is just a guess)

So the question that is asked is: **[What is the Cheapest RAM for MacBook Pro][2]**?

This depends on a few variables before I can help answer this question as it depends on whether you are looking to buy name brand memory or generic ram for the MacBook Pros.  With the name brand RAM, such as Crucial Technology (other stores carry name brand memory too, but it&#8217;s my policy to list their cheaper generic ram)  you get the satisfaction of a better (perceived, anyway) brand than if you were to buy generic memory.

But don&#8217;t discount the generic RAM for MacBook Pro as this memory, in my opinion is not only the cheaper memory option, but I have found works just as well as the name brand stuff, but for much less money, close to 50% off in some instances. The generic memory is still manufactured to the same standards as name brand memory but just doesn&#8217;t come with the name brand sticker. You&#8217;re still buying ram from a memory store you can trust that offers a lifetime guarantee and have been in business for at very least a decade and specialize in both Apple memory but also PC memory too.

Save some money,  compare prices on MacBook Pro Memory and max out your Apple MacBook Prow with as much ram as it can handle.

Here&#8217;s some current **cheapest prices on Apple MacBook Memory Upgrades**:

Lenovo is of many PC notebook and netbooks that could benefit from a memory upgrade in 2011 as in most cases, when these IBM notebook computers ship they ship with too little memory as default. This is done sometimes to keep the costs of the notebook computer down as the notebook PC market can be competitive and another reason why lenovo notebook PC&#8217;s don&#8217;t ship with maxed out memory is that in some cases for casual PC users who might just surf the internet, check email and [facebook][1] the factory installed ram is enough.

**[Best Selling Lenovo Notebook][2]**

But for the rest of us, and especially if  you use your notebook Lenovo computer to earn a living or for business you will want to upgrade the RAM on your notebook PC to get better performance than what the default factory ram installation can provide. Adding more memory allows for a faster Lenovo PC computer that can better accommodate the Windows operating system that runs on the Lenovo notebook PC&#8217;s and with fewer crashes and the ability to run more applications at the same time with the RAM maxed out on this PC notebook.

**Where Can I [Buy Cheap Memory][3] for Lenovo?**

Now that you&#8217;ve realized the benefits of a laptop memory upgrade it&#8217;s now time to do a little bit of shopping online for memory. You work hard for your dollar, and you don&#8217;t want to over spend on your memory upgrade but do have to decide where you want your money to go when it comes to ram upgrades. You can choose name brand memory or generic RAM. The name brand RAM pretty much explains itself. You&#8217;re buying quality RAM from an established brand with a big name in the RAM biz. [Crucial Technology ][4]comes to mind.

But if you want to get cheap ram for Lenovo, don&#8217;t discount generic memory which can save you up to 40% off and still get a memory upgrade that&#8217;s guaranteed to work when you install the memory into your notebook. I&#8217;ve made a list of** **[**recommended memory stores**][5] that will sell you **Lenovo RAM for less** and yet still offer you the guarantee and support you expect when spending money on memory. Most, if not all the stores also offer the choice to buy both generic and name brand memory from the same source so you have a choice. Except in rare circumstances, I suggest saving  money on ram and buying generic memory for your Lenovo notebook.

Yes, you sure can **[install 8GB of memory into a 2010 MacBook Pro][1]** when it comes to maxing out the ram on your computer. I recommend doing this completely and fully. It is the best dollar you can spend on your Apple MacBook, besting in most cases any other upgrade you could imagine for your MacBook Pro.

For the **2010 MacBook Pro models**, you will need to **[buy 4GB x2 memory upgrades][2] **and replace the factory ram from Apple (usually 2GB x 2)  with the larger [4GB Apple MacBook Pro RAM][3].  Some memory stores will [buy back your old RAM][4], or you can sell the smaller memory modules online at such places like eBay or craigslist to help offset the cost of upgrading your 2010 MacBook Pro for maximum performance with the most ram allowable and recognizeable by your professional Apple Computer.

[<img title="Cheapest MacBook Pro" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-24-at-7.39.14-AM1.png" alt="Best MacBook Pro Price" width="283" height="223" />][5]

**[Best MacBook Pro Prices][5]**

MacBook Pro memory upgrades come in two flavors: generic and name brand. Both options are just fine, and the best ram for MacBook Pro is the memory you feel most comofortbale with. Name brand ram might offer value to you if you would prefer not to install generic ram, but the generic memory I track prices for will work just fine and you get the added benefit of saving money on memory upgrades &#8211; up to 50% off the name brand vendor but you still can trust the generic memory store as all memory stores I track prices for are reputable memory stores that have been with me for at very least a decade and offer money back gaurantees and warranties for your MacBook Pro RAM upgrade in the slight chance that there&#8217;s something wrong with your MacBook RAM, but it&#8217;s unlikely. In 14 years of monitoring ram prices, I can count the complaints about the memory stores I track on one hand and yet over the years I have helped thousands save money on memory upgrades.

This is easy. The **[cheapest RAM is right here][1]**.

Now that we have that out of the way, I need to clarify a bit. First, for the most part I specialize in [Apple Computer Memory Upgrades][2] for the most part, so if you&#8217;re in the market for the cheapest Dell memory, or  HP memory or where to buy cheap memory in Canada let&#8217;s say I may or may not be the resource you want. Some of the memory stores I track and monitor memory prices for also [specialize in PC Memory][3], but for the most part I stick to what I know &#8211; and that&#8217;s Apple computer memory.

&nbsp;

[<img title="Best Selling Apple RAM" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-24-at-1.55.27-PM.png" alt="Best Apple RAM Price" width="308" height="237" />][4]

**[Cheapest Apple 8GB RAM Kit][4]**

If you&#8217;re in the market for the cheapest ram to buy I think it&#8217;s my duty to advise you that the cheapest ram might not be the deal you think it is. In fact, it&#8217;s probably in your best interest to buy RAM from an established memory store or even  better if you&#8217;re a Mac user is a [store that specializes in Mac Memory][5]. You may not buy the cheapest RAM this way but you will get hassle free RAM with lifetime support from memory sellers that actually know what RAM you need to buy &#8211; regardless of Mac or PC.

RAM  is so cheap these days,  as long as you buy it from an established computer memory manufacturer, it seems almost silly to worry about whether you saved a few percent over some other store as the price difference from most trusted stores usually only differs about the same as the cost of a cup of coffee.

[Buy RAM][6] from a fair  and trusted memory store and you will have no problems with your memory upgrade which is worth more than any savings on RAM you might find from lesser memory resellers. Worry about support and quality &#8211;  not the cheapest price.

		<div class="post-content">**[MacBook Pro DDR3 8GB Memory Kits][1]**

The memory type the Apple MacBook Pro&#8217;s use depends on how new (or old)  your Apple MacBook Pro is. If you have a brand new Apple MacBook Pro the answer is easy, as  these new MacBook Pro models for 2010 use DDR3 1066Mhz SDRAM so-dimms that are on sale from a wide selection of [trusted memory shops][2].

It&#8217;s purely speculation on my part, but as we hit the 2011 calendar year, I think we will see a new MacBook Pro release soon that will use the faster DDR3 1333MHz memory specification, as both the Apple iMac and Mac Pro already run at this speed so it&#8217;s just a matter of  time until the new MacBook Pro&#8217;s use faster ram as well.

But I&#8217;m not an [Apple Rumor ][3]website, and for now the current MacBook Pros can run DDR3 1066Mhz SDRAM sodimm and can accept up to 8GB of RAM. 16GB of RAM is not yet supported in any MacBook Pro currently shipping but that too will change soon enough I&#8217;m guessing.

**MacBook Pro DDR3 1066MHz Memory Prices**

<span style="color: #000000;">Now that we have determined what kind of DDR3 RAM the MacBook Pro uses, the next step is to determine where to <a title="buy macbook pro ram" href="http://www.ramseeker.com">buy MacBook Pro RAM</a> and I can help you with that as I have been tracking and monitoring RAM prices for not just the current MacBook Pro models  but older models too: </span>

<span style="color: #000000;"><br /> </span>

<span style="color: #000000;">MacBook Pro memory is so cheap that when you compare the cost of maxing out your MacBook Pro with RAM compared to what you paid for the computer in the first place, it just seems like a no brainer to me to upgrade the RAM  as much as you can on Apple&#8217;s professional notebook computer model. </span>

I wouldn&#8217;t.

Unless you are [buying a new Apple Computer][1] and value your time and effort over money which is the only reason I can see  on why you would want to add memory from the Apple Store, I would [buy memory from a third party][2] and install the Apple memory yourself.

**[Best Selling Apple Memory][3]**

Why? Buying memory from pretty much any memory store will be cheaper than if  you bought RAM from Apple directly. To their credit, [Apple][4] does offer you the ability to buy the computer and then fill Mac with RAM at time of purchase online. This means you don&#8217;t have to replace RAM, as you would have to do if you were to buy your Apple Computer separately and then upgrade, as most of us do.

The downside of buying your  Apple computer, and then buying RAM from a much more affordable source is that you are left with the original RAM to deal with. You can [sell your memory][5] which will offset the cost of your RAM purchase, but there&#8217;s more effort and steps involved if you decide not to buy RAM from the Apple Store.

If you&#8217;re buying  a new Mac from Apple, and the extra cost is no big deal to you, than just order your new Mac with the RAM you want and be done and happy with your new Apple Computer.

If you are already in possession of your Apple Computer and want to upgrade the RAM, and want to save money on RAM then the smart thing to do is upgrade the memory yourself and deal with the factory memory that you pull from your mac. You can sell the ram on eBay, make a keychain, give it away  &#8211; the choice is yours, but if you&#8217;ve already got a Mac to upgrade, then no, do not buy RAM from the Apple Store.
