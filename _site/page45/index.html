<p>This is easy. The <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="cheapest RAM prices">cheapest RAM is right here</a></strong>.</p>

<p>Now that we have that out of the way, I need to clarify a bit. First, for the most part I specialize in <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="apple memory upgrades">Apple Computer Memory Upgrades</a> for the most part, so if you’re in the market for the cheapest Dell memory, or  HP memory or where to buy cheap memory in Canada let’s say I may or may not be the resource you want. Some of the memory stores I track and monitor memory prices for also <a href="http://www.memoryx.net" title="PC memory upgrades">specialize in PC Memory</a>, but for the most part I stick to what I know – and that’s Apple computer memory.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW">Cheapest Apple 8GB RAM Kit</a></strong></p>

<p>If you’re in the market for the cheapest ram to buy I think it’s my duty to advise you that the cheapest ram might not be the deal you think it is. In fact, it’s probably in your best interest to buy RAM from an established memory store or even  better if you’re a Mac user is a <a href="http://www.macsales.com" title="mac memory specialist">store that specializes in Mac Memory</a>. You may not buy the cheapest RAM this way but you will get hassle free RAM with lifetime support from memory sellers that actually know what RAM you need to buy – regardless of Mac or PC.</p>

<p>RAM  is so cheap these days,  as long as you buy it from an established computer memory manufacturer, it seems almost silly to worry about whether you saved a few percent over some other store as the price difference from most trusted stores usually only differs about the same as the cost of a cup of coffee.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/" title="buy ram">Buy RAM</a> from a fair  and trusted memory store and you will have no problems with your memory upgrade which is worth more than any savings on RAM you might find from lesser memory resellers. Worry about support and quality –  not the cheapest price.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2011/01/what-kind-of-ddr3-ram-do-macbook-pros-use/">What Kind of DDR3 RAM Do MacBook Pros Use?</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW">MacBook Pro DDR3 8GB Memory Kits</a></strong></p>

<p>The memory type the Apple MacBook Pro’s use depends on how new (or old)  your Apple MacBook Pro is. If you have a brand new Apple MacBook Pro the answer is easy, as  these new MacBook Pro models for 2010 use DDR3 1066Mhz SDRAM so-dimms that are on sale from a wide selection of <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="trusted memory shops">trusted memory shops</a>.<br />
[table id=1 /]</p>

<p>It’s purely speculation on my part, but as we hit the 2011 calendar year, I think we will see a new MacBook Pro release soon that will use the faster DDR3 1333MHz memory specification, as both the Apple iMac and Mac Pro already run at this speed so it’s just a matter of  time until the new MacBook Pro’s use faster ram as well.</p>

<p>But I’m not an <a href="http://www.applerumors.com" title="apple rumor site">Apple Rumor </a>website, and for now the current MacBook Pros can run DDR3 1066Mhz SDRAM sodimm and can accept up to 8GB of RAM. 16GB of RAM is not yet supported in any MacBook Pro currently shipping but that too will change soon enough I’m guessing.</p>

<p><strong>MacBook Pro DDR3 1066MHz Memory Prices</strong></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;">Now that we have determined what kind of DDR3 RAM the MacBook Pro uses, the next step is to determine where to <a title="buy macbook pro ram" href="http://www.ramseeker.com">buy MacBook Pro RAM</a> and I can help you with that as I have been tracking and monitoring RAM prices for not just the current MacBook Pro models  but older models too: </span></p>

<p>[table id=1 /]</p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;"><br /> </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;">MacBook Pro memory is so cheap that when you compare the cost of maxing out your MacBook Pro with RAM compared to what you paid for the computer in the first place, it just seems like a no brainer to me to upgrade the RAM  as much as you can on Apple’s professional notebook computer model. </span></p>

<p>Why? Buying memory from pretty much any memory store will be cheaper than if  you bought RAM from Apple directly. To their credit, <a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple</a> does offer you the ability to buy the computer and then fill Mac with RAM at time of purchase online. This means you don’t have to replace RAM, as you would have to do if you were to buy your Apple Computer separately and then upgrade, as most of us do.</p>

<p>The downside of buying your  Apple computer, and then buying RAM from a much more affordable source is that you are left with the original RAM to deal with. You can <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/where-can-i-sell-old-ram/" title="sell original memory">sell your memory</a> which will offset the cost of your RAM purchase, but there’s more effort and steps involved if you decide not to buy RAM from the Apple Store.</p>

<p>If you’re buying  a new Mac from Apple, and the extra cost is no big deal to you, than just order your new Mac with the RAM you want and be done and happy with your new Apple Computer.</p>

<p>If you are already in possession of your Apple Computer and want to upgrade the RAM, and want to save money on RAM then the smart thing to do is upgrade the memory yourself and deal with the factory memory that you pull from your mac. You can sell the ram on eBay, make a keychain, give it away  – the choice is yours, but if you’ve already got a Mac to upgrade, then no, do not buy RAM from the Apple Store.</p>

<p>If there’s one popular computer when it comes to <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com">RAM Prices</a> (or if you prefer, memory prices) it’s the MacBook Pro.  Desktop computers do have their applications and usually offer more value in speed, upgradeability and  in some cases as the Apple iMac – screen size – it’s the notebook computers from Apple that really offer the best value whether you choose the budget oriented MacBook or the faster MacBook Pro that offers more expandability options as well.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1149" title="Cheapest MacBook Pro" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-24-at-7.39.14-AM1.png" alt="Best MacBook Pro Price" width="283" height="223" /></a></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I">Cheapest MacBook Pro</a></strong></p>

<p>One of the best expandability options on the MacBook Pro is the option to add more RAM memory (RAM and Memory should be considered interchangeable when it comes to this article).</p>

<p>The newest Apple MacBook models (which aren’t that new – there’s a a MacBook Pro refresh needed in 2011)  allow for a maximum of 8GB DDR3 SDRAM sodimms to be installed replacing what is usually installed from the factory: 2x2GB memory modules for  a total of 4GB MacBook Pro RAM that ships standard with your MacBook Pro.</p>

<p>But to get the maximum performance from your professional Apple notebook computer, I recommend you max out your MBP to the 8GB allowable. 8GB for the MacBook Pro costs just over $100 at time of writing – a far cry from the $1000 it cost just a few short years ago, making a 8GB RAM Upgrade for MacBook Pro one of the better upgrades you can achieve this year to increase your computing performance.</p>

<p><strong>Where to Buy MacBook Pro Memory</strong></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;">I have been tracking RAM Prices on MacBook Pro memory starting with the DDR2 memory the older MacBook Pro’s  required and now with the newer and faster MacBook Pros that use the DDR3 RAM instead and I prefer to leave it to you to decide where to buy MacBook Pro RAM rather than push one particular store.  The lowest price on MacBook Pro Memory is just one factor when considering buying RAM for Apple but below is a table listing current and lowest ram prices for MacBook Pro: </span></p>

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p> </p>

<p>The short answer:  not much at all. <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="ram is cheap">RAM is cheap</a> and you should, if you can afford to – max out the RAM on your Apple Computer.<br />
[table id=15 /]MacBook Pro Memory is just one of the most popular Apple upgrades you can buy today.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW">Best RAM for Apple Notebooks</a></strong></p>

<p>The longer answer to this question is: it depends on what computer you want to add more memory to, be it an Apple iMac, Apple MacBook, Apple MacBook Pro or Apple Mac Pro as they all require different memory upgrades depending on what specific Apple Computer you are looking to upgrade.</p>

<p>For this article, we’re going to talk about currently shipping <a href="ttp://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref_%3Dnb_sb_ss_c_1_14%26field-keywords%3Dapple%2520computer%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Delectronics%26sprefix%3Dapple%2520computer&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">Apple Computers on sale</a> and we’ll cover the discontinued Apple computers in the future.</p>

<p>For the Apple iMac it will <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/iMac_(DDR3_1333)/">cost you as little as $52 for a 4GB memory upgrade</a> module. Assuming the Apple iMac can accept 16GB , you will need to buy four 4gb memory modules for iMac which would bring your total up to just over $200 at today’s memory prices for Apple iMac</p>

<p>With the professional desktop from Apple – the Apple Mac Pro, this is where it gets really interesting as depending on which current Apple Mac Pro you have you might require DDR3 1066Mhz or DDR3 1333MHz sodimm memory upgrades. And as there’s  lots of room for memory upgrades inside a Mac Pro you could <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/Mac_Pro_RAM_Upgrade_Kits_DDR3_1333_with_8GB_RAM/">drop almost $2000 to fill your Mac Pro with memory</a> up to the Maximum 64GB of RAM the latest Mac Pro models can recognize</p>

<p>The tiny desktop Mac, the Mac Mini use DDR3 1066Mhz sodimms and can accept up to 8GB of DDR3 SDRAM so to max out your new Apple Mac Mini you would need to <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/Mac_Mini_(1066_DDR3)/" title="buy 4gb ram mac mini">buy 4GB x 2</a> to get the full performance from Apple’s tiniest desktop computer made to date costing you a bit over $100 with two 4GB Mac Mini RAM upgrades</p>

<p>On the notebook side, Both the Apple MacBook and Apple MacBook Pro accept the same type of RAM: The DDR3 SDRAM 1066Mhz sodimms, the difference between the two models being the maximum amounts of memory the two different MacBook models can accept. On the MacBook, 4GB of RAM is the maximum so the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_KITS_(1066_DDR3)-4gb/" title="macbook ram prices">cost would be as little as $50</a> and for the MacBook Pro’s which can accept up to 8GB of RAM, the cost doubles to just a tad <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_KITS_(1066_DDR3)/">over $100 to fill your MacBook Pro with the most memory possible</a>.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2011/01/ddr3-ram-for-imac/">1333Mhz DDR3 Memory for Your iMac On Sale Every Day</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8IO6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8IO6">Cheap Apple iMacs On Sale</a></strong></p>

<p>[table id=2 /]DDR3 RAM for iMac has been the default memory type for the popular Apple desktop computer for some time now. Until earlier this summer the Apple iMacs used and required only one type of DDR3 RAM : DDR3 1066MHz SDRAM so-dimms.</p>

<p>But with the release of the newest Apple iMacs in the summer of 2010, Apple introduced a new memory requirement that not only used faster ram speed than prior iMacs but also allowed the iMac to use and recognize up to 16GB of RAM.</p>

<p>DDR3 1333MHz memory upgrades are what is required for the newest Apple iMacs when it comes to memory upgrades for Apple’s latest computer.</p>

<p>Buying DDR3 memory from Apple, in my opinion is not a good way to save your hard earned money and you can do better on the price if you buy either generic or even name brand memory for the Apple iMacs from a <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com">trusted third party memory store</a>.</p>

<p>DDR3 memory price for Apple iMac continue to drop in price over time, and just about two years ago, upgrading your Apple iMac to 8GB would  cost you as much as the desktop itself. But as the DDR3 RAM technology becomes more popular the prices for DDR3 RAM just get cheaper and cheaper.</p>

<p><strong>DDR3 RAM Prices for iMac</strong></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;">I monitor both DDR3 1066MHz and DDR3 1333Mhz memory upgrades in both memory upgrade kit form as some memory stores prefer to market the RAM for iMacs in this fashion as there’s a good chance you will buy 2 or more iMac memory modules to install at the same time to maximize your iMac’s memory. But I also list DDR3 iMac RAM prices for individual memory uprades for  iMac as well. I suggest you check both to get the best deal on your DDR3 RAM upgrade purchase.</span></p>

<p>It’s been a few years since the Black MacBook models were available so it should come as no surprise that these MacBook models take and accept  less RAM than the more modern unibody MacBook models available today.</p>

<p>As far as <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com">Maximum RAM for the Black MacBooks</a>, the answer to this question will depend on the source. According to Apple the Black MacBooks can accept and use up to 4Gb on the later 2008 models, but some memory vendors claim to be able to run 6GB of black macbook memory without trouble, but it’s always been my policy to tow the company line and  stick to the maximum memory upgrades as quoted by Apple. Your mileage may vary…</p>

<p>For older MacBook models in black, the maximum memory was a paltry 2GB (when compared to today’s 4GB maximum) of <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_(PC5300_DDR)/">PC2 5300 DD2 SDRAM sodimms</a> that the black macbook requires to run.  Again, some memory stores claimed 3GB would  work in the black macbooks thanks to 2GB installed in one of the two memory upgrade slots available for upgrade but again, Apple says it will take 2GB maximum, so this is the maximum amount I suggest. To do so, you will have to replace the smaller sized factory memory (usually 2x512mb)  and install 1GB x 2 for a maximum of 2GB on the black MacBook models.</p>

<p>When shopping for <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com">MacBook Pro Memory </a> it can be a good idea to shop for memory upgrade kits for MacBook Pro as some memory stores offer memory upgrade kits that include two MacBook Pro memory upgrade modules.</p>

<p>Usually, these memory upgrade kits make sense to buy as you usually save money on MacBook Pro ram as you will need to buy two memory modules anyway if you want to maximize the ram on your MacBook Pro and 8GB kits for MacBook Pro is the most memory you can install in MacBook Pros in 2010 (and 2011 so far, but my guess is this  will change with new MacBook models being announced soon enough).</p>

<p>I’ll start this article by offering advice on where not to <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="buy mac mini ram">buy Mac Mini RAM</a>, and that’s from <a href="http://www.apple.com" title="apple">Apple</a> directly. The good folks at Apple do a great job at making many great products and there’s no doubt that I’m an Apple fan, but when it comes to selling RAM, you will not find the cheapest ram at our favorite fruit company.<br />

<p>Where you will find <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="mac mini ram deals">great deals on Mac Mini RAM</a> to buy is right here as I have been tracking and monitoring memory prices since 1997 which is longer than well, anyone – and over the years I have created a chart which compares Apple Mac Mini RAM upgrades for whatever Mac Mini you are looking to upgrade:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/Mac_mini/" title="mac mini pc2700 sdram">The first Mac Mini requires PC27000 DDR RAM</a></p>

<p>The second series of Mac Mini uses PC5300 DDR SDRAM and is marketed as both <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/Mac_Mini_KITS_(PC5300)/">Mac Mini memory upgrade kits</a> or by <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/Mac_Mini_(PC_5300)/">individual Mac Mini PC5300 memory modules</a>.</p>

<p>The latest and newest Apple Mac Minis to be released require DDR3 SDRAM and <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/Mac_Mini_(1066_DDR3)/">Mac Mini DDR3 memory</a> and <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/Mac_Mini_KITS_(1066_DDR3)/">Mac Mini DDR3 memory upgrade kits</a> are available to purchase for Apple’s smallest and cheapest Apple computer available today.</p>

<p>Now that we have determined the different Mac Mini models and what memory modules you will need to buy the next question is <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="where to buy mac mini ram">where to buy RAM for Apple Mac Mini</a>? I compare ram prices from reputable memory stores only (and have for over 14 years) so you won’t find any shady memory resllers.

    <h1><a href="/2011/01/where-can-i-sell-old-ram/">Where Can I Sell Old RAM?</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>If you buy any new computer, regardless of make or brand  – be it a Dell, Apple, HP or other computer manufacturer when it comes time to upgrade your notebook or desktop computer you usually have to replace the factory installed memory upgrade with larger sized memory upgrade modules to add more memory to your computer</p>

<div style="float: right; margin-right: 5px;">
</div>

<p>Unless you buy your computer direct from the factory and with the maximum memory installed you will want to, or need to replace your memory that is already in your computer for a larger memory upgrade chip. One way to offset the cost of  a memory upgrade for your computer is to sell the factory ram to a memory reseller or manufacturer where they can still use the parts and individual chips on the memory board for the manufacture of larger memory upgrades in the future.</p>

<p>This leaves you asking:** “where can I sell old RAM”? **and it’s a good question as some, not all memory manufacturers will buy back your memory but I do know of a few placesa that will be happy to buy your RAM that was previously installed in your computer:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Sell the RAM yourself</strong>. This could effectively gain you the highest price possible if you were to decide to sell old ram in this manner. <a href="http://www.ebay.com">Ebay</a> and <a href="http://www.craigslist.org">Craigslist</a> are two such websites where you could get paid cash for your old memory or ram upgrades</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>**Sell the RAM back to the computer memory manufacturer **at the same time as you buy new ram. Essentially working the same way as trade-in on a car purchase works, you trade in your old ram and use the funds from the old ram against your new memory buy.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p> **Sell the RAM back to a memory store or manufacturer that is different **from where you buy your new memory upgrades</p>
  </li>
</ol>
