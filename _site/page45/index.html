   <B> <h1><a href="/2011/01/best-ram-for-a-mac-ddr-sdram/">Best RAM for a Mac: 8GB 1600 Mhz DDR3 SDRAM</a></h1></B>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>When shopping for the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="best mac ram upgrades">best Mac RAM upgrades</a>, regardless of what specific Mac computer you have there’s a very good chance you will be shopping for DDR SDRAM, as this specific memory upgrade type has been in circulation for close to a decade, if not longer.</p>

<div id="asa-df73f90be755f6bb27ee4eb8d88ffce7" class="asa_async_container asa_async_container_default">
</div>

<p>Today’s popular <strong>DDR SDRAM Memory Upgrades</strong> for Mac all tend to be  from the DDR3 family running at speeds of up to 1333Mhz and with capacities of 8GB in size for each DDR3 memory upgrade chip which for upgrading an Apple Mac computer in 2011 means you could, if you have very deep pockets – install up to 64GB of RAM in an Apple Mac Pro.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Even though the DDR3 1333Mhz specification did not start to come onto the scene for Apple Memory Upgrades until the release of the 2010 iMac and Mac Pro models about halfway through the year, in the short time that they have been available, and especially when it comes to the larger Mac Pro Memory Upgrade Kits consisting of memory kits based on 8GB DDR3 1333Mhz memory modules, the prices have dropped at very least 30% in the past six months or so on DDR3 1333Mhz memory upgrades. Regardless of the DDR ram specification,  ram prices continue to drop over time. If you wait, you get a better deal on ram than if you are an early adopter and buy ram when the new DDR3 ram is used and recognized by Apple computers.</p>

<p>The other specification for Apple DDR3 SDRAM is the 1066Mhz speed, which obviously does not run as fast as the 1333Mhz RAM. With other speeds of DDR RAM, you might be able to get away with buying the faster of the two memory upgrade speeds and the ram would gear down to the lower DDR MHz speed if need be. But this is not the case with the DDR3 1066 and DDR3 1333MHz. You cannot interchange the memory for your Mac. If your Apple requires the faster DDR3 RAM, you need to buy the right DDR SDRAM for your Apple Computer Model.</p>

<p>To make things a bit easier for you to determine what RAM you need, here are the current ram prices for currently shipping Apple computer models:</p>

<p>I recently switched from over a decade of using a Mac every day to using a PC notebook. Why? I find that most of my use for my notebook is email and writing and all of this can be done in any browser window. I prefer Chrome from Google as when I compare my open windows from Mac to PC there’s not much difference between a<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005CWJ3MM/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B005CWJ3MM"> $2000 MacBook  Pro</a> and a<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005UUSHD2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B005UUSHD"> $500 PC notebook. </a></p>

<p><strong>Security Programs for PC NoteBooks vs Mac Laptops </strong></p>

<p>One area where I really was unprepared was when it comes to security software. This is one area where the Mac just shines and that’s with viruses –  or the  lack thereof I have experienced on an Apple notebook in all the years I have been using Apple computers.  Compare to a PC, where you need to buy an antivirus program from the moment you turn on your PC and this left me asking what is the best Antivirus software in 2012?</p>

<p><strong>Free Antivirus Software from Microsoft. </strong></p>

<p>One solution for Windows 7 Antivirus software is to download the free **<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/products/security-essentials">Microsoft Security Essentials</a>. **I know there are other antivirus and security options out there. Some free, like <a href="http://free.avg.com/us-en/homepage">AVG</a> and some that will cost you a few dollars from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/mn/search/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;field-keywords=kaspersky&amp;url=search-alias%3Dsoftware&amp;sprefix=kapers#/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias=software">McAfee</a>, <a href="&quot;http://www.amazon.com/mn/search/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;field-keywords=kaspersky&amp;url=search-alias%3Dsoftware&amp;sprefix=kapers">Kaperksy </a>and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/mn/search/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;field-keywords=kaspersky&amp;url=search-alias%3Dsoftware&amp;sprefix=kapers#/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias=software">Norton </a>to name a few, but I figure who would know more about protecting their products more? The folks that made the software you want to protect or  some third party antivirus software company?</p>

<p>In my books it makes perfect sense to trust Microsoft for my Antivirus needs.  I guess it all depends on what you need form  an Antivirus program and from my research that some software excels where others fail, but Microsoft Security essentials meets my needs for one reason: It’s free antivirus software.  I swear, the the older I get  – the cheaper  I get and the thought of  having to pay over $100 for some software to protect my PC that’s not worth much more than that in total hardware costs just does not make sense to me.</p>

<p><strong>Free Antivirus Software That Works</strong></p>

<p>But just because this free software to protect your PC does not  mean it’s no good. Take a look at the feature set for the 2012 version of Microsoft Security Essentials:</p>

<p>Real Time Protection of your PC from spyware, viruses and other malware (malicious software – that’s a fancy term for software that  is up to no good)</p>

<p>System Cleaning automatically quarantines any questionable files on your PC it finds and notifies you of the potential threat.</p>

<p>System Scanning does just what it says it does and scans your system for any viruses you may already have on your Windows PC but not know  it.</p>

<p>Automatic Firewall Protection. The firewall settings can be tricky  to navigate for  the average PC user like me  and  the MSE takes care of all that  technical stuff for me.</p>

<p>Rootkit protection sounds complicated, and this is just one more thing that  the free antivirus software from Microsoft takes care of for me and it’s sophisticated enough  to recognize the good software from the bad that could  harm your PC.</p>

<p>And this is the part that I was really impressed with – Microsoft Essentials takes care of the network protection as  I am totally lost when it comes to protecting other computers on my home network. I am  happy to hand this task off to Microsoft.</p>

<p><strong>Why is  this antivirus software for Windows 7 Free? </strong></p>

<p>Microsoft could have charged for this – and charged  a pretty competitive price too. Others that offer free antivirus usually are really fremium where the whole point is to nag you to death until you cave and buy their full featured software and thus, the income stream.  I think Microsoft offers this antivirus software for free is for goodwill.</p>

<p>Think about it : If this free software keeps your Windows 7 PC running smoothly and trouble free you are more likely to think that Windows is overall is a better value, and  over time you will continue to buy more Windows PCs allowing  Microsoft to sell more software. You may win short term,  but in  the end Microsoft gets to keep you as a loyal customer which is something they value more than any $20 profit on anivirus software.</p>

<p>Have a look at <strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/products/security-essentials">Microsoft Security Essentials</a></strong>. MSE download is free,  so this all costs you nothing but the time to install Microsoft Essentials download. This is one of the best software available today for keeping your PC virus free for free.  It’s working fine for me.</p>

<p>Determining what <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">DDR3 RAM</a> you need for your Apple Macintosh computer is really not all that difficult as Apple lists technical specifications for all <a href="http://www.apple.com/mac/">current shipping Macs</a> on their website which will help you find the correct DDR3 memory for new Apple Computers such as Apple iMac, Apple MacBook Pro, Apple MacBook and Mac Pro and Mac Mini computer models.</p>

<p>If you’re looking to upgrade a now discontinued apple computer there’s a good chance that DDR3 memory is not the correct memory you need anyway, as except for a few recently discontinued Apple computers like the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/iMac_(DDR3_1066)/">discontinued Apple iMac</a> that until mid summer 2010 was a current Apple iMac model most older computers from Apple require either DDR1 or even just DDR memory to run. If you do need to upgrade RAM on non-DDR3 Apple computers I suggest you visit <a href="http://www.lowendmac.com">Low End Mac</a> which has specifications on memory and more for every mac ever made.</p>

<p>Now that we’ve determined that you do need to <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com">buy DDR3 RAM for Mac</a> the next question to get asked is where to buy Apple Memory and from whom? I’ve put together a little list of <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/where-to-buy-computer-memory-upgrades/">Apple Memory Stores</a> where you can use to find a third party memory store that suits your needs when shopping for DDR3 RAM.</p>

<p>Usually, the next step after you have determined which DDR3 RAM you need and where you might like to buy DDR3 RAM from is price. It’s only natural to want to save money on memory upgrades, regardless of memory type and again, I have compiled some data on DDR3 RAM prices for Apple Computers:</p>

<p>Desktop memory, while not as popular a computer memory upgrade as it once might have been due to the popularity of notebooks, netbooks and even tablet computers such as the Apple iPad still can offer the most bang per computing dollar thanks to the design which in most cases, allow for faster processors, better cooling and larger displays than their portable counterparts.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013FK9U2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0013FK9U2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1052" title="Cheapest Mac Mini" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-14-at-10.51.55-AM.png" alt="Best Deal Mac Mini" width="283" height="168" /></a></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013FK9U2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0013FK9U2">Best Selling Desktop</a>: The Apple Mac Mini</strong></p>

<p>One of the <strong>best upgrades for a desktop computer (</strong>save perhaps for a processor) is to add more memory and fill your desktop computer with as much memory as possible – regardless of whether you built your own PC or are looking for more performance out of your factory desktop from computer manufacturers such as <a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple</a>, <a href="http://www.dell.com">Dell</a>, or <a href="http://www.hp.com">HP</a>.</p>

<p>One of the first things you need to do when shopping for the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="best desktop ram upgrades"><strong>best desktop ram upgrades</strong></a> is to determine what specific memory you need. If on a PC, many if not all memory stores and manufacturers offer a simple to use memory configurator that allows you to enter your processor or desktop computer model number or name into a form and the correct memory specifications will be returned to you.</p>

<p>Another option for determining the best ram for your desktop is to download a simple application that scans your computer for information relating to your model name, processor speed and in most cases this application will return specific part numbers for your desktop PC when it comes to memory upgrade requirements. <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">Crucial Technology</a> is just one memory store that offers this easy to download memory upgrade configurator.</p>

<p>Once you have determined the <strong>memory upgrade you need</strong>, the next step is to find the best price on desktop ram and I can recommend more than a few <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/where-to-buy-computer-memory-upgrades/" title="best memory stores">memory stores</a> that offer competitive pricing on desktop memory where you can save significantly when it comes time to upgrade your desktop PC.</p>

<p>If theres’s one theme to ramseeker.com it’s the fact that with a few minutes of research on ram prices it’s quite possible to save up to 40% off when buying RAM when you compare the ram prices between third party memory stores like <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memoryx">MemoryX</a>, <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/1800">18004Memory</a>, <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/OWC">OWC</a> and recently, <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">Crucial Technology</a> all offer much better and competitive pricing on memory upgrades than if you were to buy ram direct from the computer manufacturer such as <a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple</a>,  <a href="http://www.dell.com">Dell</a>, <a href="http://hp.com">HP</a> and so on…</p>

<p>The only reason I can think of why you might want to buy ram direct from the manufacturer of your computer is if  you were to configure the memory upgrade at the same time you bought your computer. You’ll pay for the convenience of doing so, but the benefit of doing this is you eliminate the cost and hassle of having to <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com">buy memory online</a> and then installing the memory upgrade in your computer yourself. The downside of ordering or shopping for memory at the same time as buying your computer is the cost. You will pay more for memory. What you may gain in time and convenience, you will lose from your pocketbook.</p>

<p>If you’re like me and you want to buy quality memory upgrades at a better price that are still manufactured to the same exacting standards that the manufacturers demand for the memory upgrades that are compatible with  their specific computer models but without the high cost of memory that’s in most instances associated with buying ram direct from the manufacturer.</p>

<p>The solution to saving money when buying ram online is to buy ram from a trusted third party memory store. A memory store that except for a few rare cases, manufactures the memory they sell and offer the support and guarantee of the manufacturer branded memory upgrade, but without the high cost associated with the factory ram.

</a>The Apple MacBook Pro is one of the most popular Apple computers currently on sale today thanks to the professional speed and performance today’s computer user demands but on thing that’s sorely missing on a new Apple notebook that costs over a thousand dollars at the very minimum is the fact that the MacBook Pro’s do not come direct from Apple with the maximum possible memory installed. (unless you configure your MacBook Pro from the Apple Store with the maximum ram already installed)</p>

<p>[table id=14 /]</p>

<p>To increase the performance of your MacBook Pro you need to, or I suggest that you do – add more ram. The newest MacBook Pro’s from Apple allow you to install 8GB of memory in them, and this is regardless of MacBook Pro screen size. 13, 15 and 17 inch MacBook Pro’s all max out at 8GB (my guess is the  2011 MacBook Pros will max out at 16GB, but at the time of writing, this is just a guess)</p>

<p>So the question that is asked is: <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="cheapest ram for macbook pro">What is the Cheapest RAM for MacBook Pro</a></strong>?</p>

<p>This depends on a few variables before I can help answer this question as it depends on whether you are looking to buy name brand memory or generic ram for the MacBook Pros.  With the name brand RAM, such as Crucial Technology (other stores carry name brand memory too, but it’s my policy to list their cheaper generic ram)  you get the satisfaction of a better (perceived, anyway) brand than if you were to buy generic memory.</p>

<p>But don’t discount the generic RAM for MacBook Pro as this memory, in my opinion is not only the cheaper memory option, but I have found works just as well as the name brand stuff, but for much less money, close to 50% off in some instances. The generic memory is still manufactured to the same standards as name brand memory but just doesn’t come with the name brand sticker. You’re still buying ram from a memory store you can trust that offers a lifetime guarantee and have been in business for at very least a decade and specialize in both Apple memory but also PC memory too.</p>

<p>Save some money,  compare prices on MacBook Pro Memory and max out your Apple MacBook Prow with as much ram as it can handle.</p>

<p>Here’s some current <strong>cheapest prices on Apple MacBook Memory Upgrades</strong>:</p>

<p>Lenovo is of many PC notebook and netbooks that could benefit from a memory upgrade in 2011 as in most cases, when these IBM notebook computers ship they ship with too little memory as default. This is done sometimes to keep the costs of the notebook computer down as the notebook PC market can be competitive and another reason why lenovo notebook PC’s don’t ship with maxed out memory is that in some cases for casual PC users who might just surf the internet, check email and <a href="http://www.facebook.com">facebook</a> the factory installed ram is enough.</p>

<p>But for the rest of us, and especially if  you use your notebook Lenovo computer to earn a living or for business you will want to upgrade the RAM on your notebook PC to get better performance than what the default factory ram installation can provide. Adding more memory allows for a faster Lenovo PC computer that can better accommodate the Windows operating system that runs on the Lenovo notebook PC’s and with fewer crashes and the ability to run more applications at the same time with the RAM maxed out on this PC notebook.</p>

<p><strong>Where Can I <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="buy cheap memory">Buy Cheap Memory</a> for Lenovo?</strong></p>

<p>Now that you’ve realized the benefits of a laptop memory upgrade it’s now time to do a little bit of shopping online for memory. You work hard for your dollar, and you don’t want to over spend on your memory upgrade but do have to decide where you want your money to go when it comes to ram upgrades. You can choose name brand memory or generic RAM. The name brand RAM pretty much explains itself. You’re buying quality RAM from an established brand with a big name in the RAM biz. <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">Crucial Technology </a>comes to mind.</p>

<p>But if you want to get cheap ram for Lenovo, don’t discount generic memory which can save you up to 40% off and still get a memory upgrade that’s guaranteed to work when you install the memory into your notebook. I’ve made a list of** <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="http://www.ramseeker.com/where-to-buy-computer-memory-upgrades/">**recommended memory stores**</a> that will sell you **Lenovo RAM for less</strong> and yet still offer you the guarantee and support you expect when spending money on memory. Most, if not all the stores also offer the choice to buy both generic and name brand memory from the same source so you have a choice. Except in rare circumstances, I suggest saving  money on ram and buying generic memory for your Lenovo notebook.</p>

<p>Yes, you sure can <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="install 8GB memory macbook pro">install 8GB of memory into a 2010 MacBook Pro</a></strong> when it comes to maxing out the ram on your computer. I recommend doing this completely and fully. It is the best dollar you can spend on your Apple MacBook, besting in most cases any other upgrade you could imagine for your MacBook Pro.</p>

<p>For the <strong>2010 MacBook Pro models</strong>, you will need to **<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_Pro_(1066_DDR3)/">buy 4GB x2 memory upgrades</a> **and replace the factory ram from Apple (usually 2GB x 2)  with the larger <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memory/MacBook_Pro_(1066_DDR3)-4gb/" title="4GB apple macbook pro ram">4GB Apple MacBook Pro RAM</a>.  Some memory stores will <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/where-can-i-sell-old-ram/" title="buy back old ram">buy back your old RAM</a>, or you can sell the smaller memory modules online at such places like eBay or craigslist to help offset the cost of upgrading your 2010 MacBook Pro for maximum performance with the most ram allowable and recognizeable by your professional Apple Computer.</p>

<p>MacBook Pro memory upgrades come in two flavors: generic and name brand. Both options are just fine, and the best ram for MacBook Pro is the memory you feel most comofortbale with. Name brand ram might offer value to you if you would prefer not to install generic ram, but the generic memory I track prices for will work just fine and you get the added benefit of saving money on memory upgrades – up to 50% off the name brand vendor but you still can trust the generic memory store as all memory stores I track prices for are reputable memory stores that have been with me for at very least a decade and offer money back gaurantees and warranties for your MacBook Pro RAM upgrade in the slight chance that there’s something wrong with your MacBook RAM, but it’s unlikely. In 14 years of monitoring ram prices, I can count the complaints about the memory stores I track on one hand and yet over the years I have helped thousands save money on memory upgrades.</p>

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>Yes, there will be online stores claiming to have the cheapest ram prices or the largest memory store but here at ramseeker you are presented with real time price updates from memory vendors you can trust when shopping for memory upgrades at the best price online.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8IO6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8IO6">Best Selling Memory Upgrades</a></strong>The <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com">best online memory prices</a></strong> are right here.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Specializing in Apple computers, I help you get the best deal on ram upgrades from a selection of online memory stores that offer low prices and most important – support – both pre-sale and post-sale for your memory or hard drive buy, as  both of these are the two best upgrades you can do for your computer, regardless of make. (notebook batteries might also be considered a worthy upgrade as witthout power even the best computer with the most RAM and biggest hard drive is useless).</p>

<p>Back to the RAM Prices. What I do isn’t rocket science. I make note of the memory prices online from various stores and report the prices to you with a link where you can buy the best ram you need at the best price just by clicking on the price</p>

<p>Lowest prices for popular Apple computer models are in a quick and easy to read table right on the front page of ramseeker and if you need more, just select the computer memory you need. I list computer memory by speed, so you will have to do your homework to find out what type of memory you need to buy before you use my chart. The  memory stores online I track ram prices all offer memory configurators too so when you need more ram all you have to do is find your exact computer model to find the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="best online memory prices">computer memory you need at the best price online</a></p>

<p>This is easy. The <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="cheapest RAM prices">cheapest RAM is right here</a></strong>.</p>

<p>Now that we have that out of the way, I need to clarify a bit. First, for the most part I specialize in <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="apple memory upgrades">Apple Computer Memory Upgrades</a> for the most part, so if you’re in the market for the cheapest Dell memory, or  HP memory or where to buy cheap memory in Canada let’s say I may or may not be the resource you want. Some of the memory stores I track and monitor memory prices for also <a href="http://www.memoryx.net" title="PC memory upgrades">specialize in PC Memory</a>, but for the most part I stick to what I know – and that’s Apple computer memory.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW"><img title="Best Selling Apple RAM" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-24-at-1.55.27-PM.png" alt="Best Apple RAM Price" width="308" height="237" /></a></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW">Cheapest Apple 8GB RAM Kit</a></strong></p>

<p>If you’re in the market for the cheapest ram to buy I think it’s my duty to advise you that the cheapest ram might not be the deal you think it is. In fact, it’s probably in your best interest to buy RAM from an established memory store or even  better if you’re a Mac user is a <a href="http://www.macsales.com" title="mac memory specialist">store that specializes in Mac Memory</a>. You may not buy the cheapest RAM this way but you will get hassle free RAM with lifetime support from memory sellers that actually know what RAM you need to buy – regardless of Mac or PC.</p>

<p>RAM  is so cheap these days,  as long as you buy it from an established computer memory manufacturer, it seems almost silly to worry about whether you saved a few percent over some other store as the price difference from most trusted stores usually only differs about the same as the cost of a cup of coffee.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/" title="buy ram">Buy RAM</a> from a fair  and trusted memory store and you will have no problems with your memory upgrade which is worth more than any savings on RAM you might find from lesser memory resellers. Worry about support and quality –  not the cheapest price.</p>
