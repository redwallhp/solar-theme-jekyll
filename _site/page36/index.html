   <B> <h1><a href="/2011/06/apple-imac-27-inch-3-1ghz-memory-upgrades/">Apple iMac 27 inch 3.1GHz Memory Upgrades</a></h1></B>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content">The difference between this model of iMac and the [cheaper 2.7GHz model][1], asides from the $300 discount is the faster video card  with more RAM: 1GB vs 512mb as what comes standard on all other Apple iMac models, resulting in faster video performance which is  more important for gaming than surfing [facebook][2]. And if you buy the fast iMac from Apple directly you can configure this Apple iMac with even a faster processor running at  3.4Gz,  but in the  stock configuration you can **[buy the  3.1GHz][3]** is the [fastest iMac that you can buy today from Apple][4]. All else pretty much the same. Apple offers a bigger hard drive option at 2TB, but you can upgrade the hard  drive for any iMac pretty easily so that&#8217;s not much of a feature, although if you are working in video or using large files like photoshop files or movies you can never have enough hard drive space, (or RAM, too)This specific [Apple iMac][5] model is the **[fastest Apple iMac you can buy][3]** and also offers the biggest LCD display as well. Simply put, if you&#8217;re in the market for an Apple iMac and need the **biggest and baddest Apple consumer desktop computer you can buy**, then look no further than the Apple iMac 27 inch model running at 3.1 GHz.

**Is the faster 27 inch iMac worth it?**

I have already noted that I think the [Apple iMac 21.5 inch ][6]is the best deal out of the two 2011 21.5 inch Apple iMacs, but if you can afford the extra $500 from the price of this Apple iMac, than the **extra screen real estate from 21.5  inches  to 27 inches is quite the jump**, and probably will allow you to get more work done than the processor upgrade from 2.7Ghz to 3.1. GHz. If you are deciding on what iMac to buy, the 27 inch  2.7 GHz model might be the best deal just based on the fact of screen size alone.

I always like to **compare prices of computers**, where in 2011 more than ever there&#8217;s a good chance you can make money with your computer than ever before. Maybe you freelance in photography or writing and any money you make on the side could be used towards paying for your new iMac. The one good thing about Apple computers is that they tend  to hold their life well and unless you need the latest and greatest computer you can buy, **an iMac should last you about 3 years or so**. I&#8217;m writing this on a 2008 MacBook Pro that has paid  for itself over and over the past three years and for the work I do, I see no reason for an upgrade.

Assuming you get 3 years out of your iMac, which is quite possible and if you **[add AppleCare for your iMac][7]** you&#8217;ve got a trouble free Mac desktop with full warranty, the 2.7 Ghz works out to costing $47.00 monthly, and the stock iMac 3.1 GHz works out a few dollars more at $55.00 &#8211; About eight dollars a month more.  $55 a month, and the  fastest iMac is paid  for. Less,  if you find a way to make more money with your computer. It&#8217;s quite possible to earn a living with your Mac, and as you see the **price difference between the 2.7GHz and 3.1GHz Apple iMacs**, when broken down over the three years is negligible.

**Adding more RAM to the iMac 3.1GHz**

[table id=2 /]

Out of the box, the Apple iMac 3.1 GHz comes from Apple shipped with just **8GB of RAM**, which for light computer use  like checking your email, or booking a vacation, or some other rather processor light task or if you just want  to use the included iApps like iTunes and iPhoto and the like, then the 8GB of factory supplied RAM will probably do you.

But if you&#8217;ve bought 2 grand worth of iMac to get the **fastest iMac you can buy** this year, you either need the added screen real estate a 27 inch iMac offers, or even more likely, you **need the processor speed **and the cheapest way to upgrade your iMac processor is to add more memory to your Apple 3.1 GHz iMac. And as long as you  don&#8217;t **[buy RAM from Apple][8]**, you can upgrade the iMac to the full 16GB of RAM for less than $100. Actually, as I write this in the summer of 2011, less than $70 for another 8GB of  iMac RAM is quite possible.

Once you&#8217;ve decided to buy more iMac RAM and fill the fastest iMac with as much RAM as possible, you need to buy another **8GB of DDR3 1333Mhz SDRAM sodimms**. There was once  a time when Apple computers were much more fussy about the memory requirements and  you needed to buy memory for specifically for Apple computers but for now those days are behind us and  as long as  you buy quality memory upgrades from memory stores you can trust, with the right memory specifications  you will have no problems when installing memory in this Apple computer or any other, either.

**How to Install iMac 3.1 GHz 27 inch  Memory  Upgrades**

Apple computer can show you to [install iMac RAM ][9]much  better than I can, but essentially you need to place the  iMac face down on your desk (I suggest  a soft blanket  or towel so you don&#8217;t scratch that big beautiful lcd display)  and  remove the door to access the four iMac memory upgrade slots on the bottom of the iMac. There&#8217;s four slots available for memory upgrades, and two of them are going to be empty and just waiting for you to add two more **[4GB DDR3 SDRAM 1333Mhz sodimms][10]**, or  if you prefer, an **[8GB Apple iMac memory][11]** upgrade kit that bundles two 4GB DDR3 for iMac together.

One thing you do have to be careful about when installing memory upgrades is static electricity. If you wish to be real careful you can add an anti static strap to your memory order when **buying  iMac RAM** but it&#8217;s really not needed if you&#8217;re careful to ground yourself, which is done by touching metal on the iMac before you touch the memory upgrade for iMacs, as the static electricity  can damage your memory upgrade.

The **[Apple iMac 27 inch 3.1GHz][3]** is one fast and well designed computer and with the additional 8GB of RAM that you can install yourself and buy for much less than what Apple charges adding **[another 8GB of RAM to the  fastest iMac][11]** in 2011 couldn&#8217;t be easier.

I&#8217;ve already written about [memory][1] for the **[cheapest iMac ][2] ****[on sale][2]**in 2011, and  the next iMac upgrade from that one, the [21.5  inch 2.7 GHz model][3], that when you **compare the two 21.5 inch iMacs** the latter comes out ahead even though it does cost more money initially.  But the game changes with this  27 inch iMac becuase  now we&#8217;re into the **big screen iMac memory upgrades** and  when it comes to **adding more RAM to a 27 inch iMac in 2011** this biggest and cheapest iMac you can buy today this cheap, yet big screen iMac might  just offer the best bang for the buck for Apple consumer desktop models available on sale today.

**27 inch Intel Core i5 Technical Specs**

<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2281" title="Free RAM for 27 inch iMac" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Screen-shot-2011-06-22-at-11.57.15-AM.png" alt="How to get iMac RAM FREE" width="633" height="494" />

Technically, the low end, big screen iMac is exactly the same as the higher end 21.5 inch model. Same speed Intel Core i5 processor, same maximum memory at 16GB, same  video card, same 1TB hard drive, and of course the new [2011 iMac features][4] such as thunderbolt technology, facetime,  and all the rest. **You do get a few more connection options when you compare the 21.5 inch iMacs to the 27 inch models**, as the big screen iMac offers one more thunderbolt connector than the  smaller imac does, but for the **price difference between the $1499 21.5 inch iMac and the $1699 27 inch Apple iMac**, the reason for the $200 premium is  the much larger screen the 27 inch iMac display offers.

**Which iMac to Buy?**

If you&#8217;e on a budget then **[buy the cheapest iMac you can][2]** which, if you buy from Amazon or [MacMall][5],you&#8217;ll save over what is available and on sale  at the Apple Store. And I&#8217;ve already explained that the **[faster 21.5 inch iMac is better value long term][3]** but if it were me, and especially if  I made a living from the iMac, even part time &#8211; the difference in price between a 2.7Ghz 21.5 inch, and a 2.7GHz 27 inch is just $200 more. Over a year, **that price difference works out to be just pennies a day** &#8211; about .50 or a bit more.

**Bigger  Screen =  Faster iMac**

This is something that can get overlooked. I&#8217;m just recently back from a week away working with a borrowed MacBook Air, and as light and awesome as the MacBook Air, there&#8217;s something to be said for more screen real estate. With a **bigger screen, you can have more windows open, and work more efficiently**,  and if you&#8217;ve got the need for either lots of toolbars or browser windows open, a big screen on your iMac is worth way more than the pennies a day  more it costs when  compared to the faster, but smaller sized display on the Apple iMac 21.5 inch model

**iMac Intel Core i5 2.7GHz 27 inch Memory Upgrades**

Now that we&#8217;ve determined that when compared to the 21 inch iMacs, this particular iMac is the **best deal across the entire iMac lineup** I wan to talk about RAM upgrades. When you consider the cost of the iMac at $1699, and the cheapest RAM upgrade for the iMac hovers around $75 mark currently, you can get the **fastest and biggest iMac on sale  if you shop carefully**, get free ram for the iMac 27 inch too.

Let me explain:

The [iMac 27 inch costs $1699 at the Apple Store][4], and another 8GB of RAM at the Apple Store costs a whopping $400. **Total cost for a 27 inch iMac full of RAM =$2099.00**

But if you **[buy the 27 inch iMac at Amazon][6]**, you&#8217;ll save about $80 off the 1699.99 regular retail price. And the **[cheapest iMac RAM you can buy][7]** is also priced less than that discount , at about $75, so if you **buy both the iMac and RAM at Amazon** your total is still less than $1699, by about five dollars so the **total cost to upgrade your new Apple iMac to the maximum 16GB RAM is essentially FREE**. A ram upgrade that costs you nothing is the cheapest ram you&#8217;ll ever see.

**Where to Buy 27 inch Apple iMac RAM**

Of course my logic and math on getting **iMac RAM for FREE** only applies if you are ready to buy a new iMac today and apply the Amazon discount to the RAM Upgrades. If you already have a 27 inch Apple iMac and are **considering a ram upgrade to the maximum of 16GB** you can still do so, and still save enough money on RAM when compared to Apple to **[buy yourself a SSD hard drive,][8]** which after memory upgrades might be the **best performance enhancement for your Apple desktop computer** as the solid  state hard drives are **much faster than traditional hard  drives** for Apple computer and offer much faster performance when you compare the two.

Below is a current price list of where to buy  RAM for the 2011 Apple iMacs, and as you can see the **iMac ram prices are much cheaper** than the RAM prices from Apple directly.

<br>

		<div class="post-content">Unlike the **[cheapy iMac][1]**[,][1] when you cough up another $300 to $1499.00 ([you can get this iMac cheaper][2]) you get to add 16GB of iMac RAM to this and every iMac from hereon in as the get more expensive with more features down the Apple iMac lineup.When compared to the **[cheapest iMac in 2011][1]** that comes out of Apple, **[the 21.5 inch 2.7Ghz processor iMac][2]** is priced $300 higher, adds a bit more hard drive space, faster graphics card and that&#8217;s about it for differences when you **compare the Apple iMac 2.5Gz to the Apple iMac 2.7Ghz**, except one thing that&#8217;s pretty important and might long term help you squeeze more life out of your 2011 Apple iMac and that&#8217;s the fact that the **21.5 inch 2.7Ghz iMac can accept more ram** than its&#8217; 2.5GHz counterpart.

Let&#8217;s fast forward say, 3 years to 2014. **8GB of iMac RAM **is laughable as all Macs now ship standard at 32GB as the minimum ram you can get installed in any Apple computer. But, if you bought this Apple iMac model over the cheaper one, filled your iMac with another 8GB and are now running at the maximum ram allowable for 2011 iMacs, you&#8217;re **now at 16GB of RAM** and you can now forget about buying a new desktop for sometime as you now have **16GB iMac RAM**. Although when compared to 2014 computers this will seem like a paltry amount, the 16GB iMac has served you well for at least three years.

Assuming you pay full retail. (which you won&#8217;t, because you&#8217;re smart) and add another **8GB of iMac RAM** you&#8217;re now at 16GB and $1600 for your iMac. $1600/36 = $44 a month to use this iMac worry free for the next three years. For about the same price as a cheap cup of coffee a day you can **buy this iMac, fill it with RAM** and never have to worry about a new computer again.

I&#8217;ve done this with a MacBook Pro: I filled it with RAM and forgot about it. I use this 2008 MacBook Pro every day and only now, due to crummy battery life and some keyboard issues am I considering replacing my MacBook Pro with a new model. Again, I&#8217;ll research which mac to buy (or maybe even a PC, dare I say)  determine what computer best meets my needs  and then fill that mac with as much RAM as I can (assuming the RAM is affordable)

My point is this: At first glance, the **cheapest iMac might be considered a better deal** when you compare the iMac to more expensive iMacs. But if you decide you need a new iMac this particular iMac model might just be considered the **cheapest iMac overall** when you total the cost and consider that the 2.7GHz can take more RAM, and that RAM can be bought for as little as $100, or even much less.

I won&#8217;t write about all the wonderful features of the [newest 2011 iMacs][3] as I&#8217;ve kindof done that already, but I did want to point out that this particular Apple iMac, due to the fact that it&#8217;s the cheapest 2011 iMac that can take 16GB, the 2.5Ghz might be the best of the bunch despite the fact that the initial cash outlay may be more initially.

**Apple iMac 2.7GHz 21.5 inch LCD display Memory  Prices**

**<span style="font-weight: normal;">This iMac, as mentioned above can handle 16GB of RAM.  The iMac comes shipped from Apple with 8GB, so you need to <strong><a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT2KIT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1339">buy another 8GB iMac RAM</a></strong> to max out the RAM on this iMac model.

The Apple iMac 21.5 inch 2.5Ghz model released  in May 2011 is the **[cheapest Apple iMac][1] **you can buy in 2011.

Offering a fast 2.5GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i5 processor with 6MB  of on chip shared L3 cache, a gorgeous 1920&#215;1080 LCD display, 4GB of memory as the factory default Apple iMac memory configuration, 500MB of hard drive space and AMD Radeon HD6750 video card &#8211;  the newest and least expensive iMac aimed at the consumer or  home office or student  user offers a fantastic computing value and ease of use other PC manufacturers  have tried but failed to duplicate but with  fail.

<img class="size-full wp-image-2265 alignnone" title="Apple iMac Deal" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Screen-shot-2011-06-20-at-4.51.17-PM.png" alt="Best iMac Price" width="490" height="397" />

**Video**

New on the 2011 Apple iMac 21.5 inch 2.5Ghz  when compared to later or earlier iMacs is the Facetime HD  web camera and the ability to support an external monitor up to 30 inches and yet still use the iMac display as well, totaling over 50 inches of screen real estate, a perfect match for video editing or working with photography where big screens are needed for at a glance menu and toolbar selection.

**Sound**

When using Apple iTunes or any other compatible video or MP3 player (iTunes ships free with all iMac models) the sound is provided through stereo  17 watt loudspeakers and multiple ports are also inlcluded for both analog and digital audio requirements.

**Connections **

The Apple iMac offers very versatile  connection options  with all connectors placed on the rear of  the 21.5 inch iMac to compliment the clean Apple iMac design and getting unsightly cables hidden out of plain sight. One thunderbolt connector (there&#8217;s 2 thunderbolt connector on every other 2011 Apple iMac so you may want to consider a more expensive iMac if  the thunderbolt  technology is now, or will be important to your computing needs).

The mini display port offers connection options for both VGA and DVI options,  but as the connectors are specific to Apple computers, the iMac accessories can be considered expensive when compared to more standard VGA connections on your standard desktop PC&#8217;s.

One firwire 800 port is included on the iMac, but  over time you will find that as the Thunderbolt technolgy improves that it&#8217;s my guess firewire will not be included on future Apple iMac  models.

**Wireless Keyboard and Mouse**

One  of the nicest features on the new 2011 Apple iMacs is the fact that using the included bluetooth technology you&#8217;re now free of wires when using the the cheap iMac and this fact makes the  cheap iMac a much more attractive solution for home computing as some kitchens now include a little nook or small desk for a TV or computer and the iMac would make a very attractive wire-free computer for home use.

**Size and Weight**

Height: 17.75 inches (45.1 cm)  
Width: 20.8 inches (52.8 cm)  
Depth: 7.42 inches (18.85 cm)  
Weight: 20.5 pounds (9.3 kg)3

At 20lbs, the Apple iMac 21.5 inch is not light and in no way match a ultra portable computer such as the MacBook Air, but thanks to it&#8217;s sleek design with cable free technology you could move it simply and easily if you needed periodically move the Apple iMac.

**Warranty**  
This iMac model, like all Apple computers, comes standard with 90 days of telephone support to get you up and running with your new iMac and a one year limited warranty is included with the Apple iMac too. There is an extended warranty you can buy for the iMac, but as the iMac is not a portable in any sense of the word, I don&#8217;t think an extended warranty is really needed for this affordable Apple desktop. At just over $1000 for the computer itself, it makes no sense to add another cost to the AppleCare warranty which even on sale costs over $100, and unless you use the iMac in some extremely dirty or dusty environments I feel it&#8217;s better to save the $150 and apply it to more memory upgrades.

**Apple iMac 21.5 inch 2.5GHz Memory Upgrades  
**

The Apple iMac 21.5 inch 2.5Ghz model is the only model in the 2011 Apple lineup that only allows for a 8GB RAM maximum and all other faster iMacs (and more expensive too) wil accept 16GB of iMac DDR3 1333Mhz RAM. The good news is if you&#8217;re upgrading from the 2010 Apple iMac lineup, you can use and swap out the RAM from your old iMac to new.

If you&#8217;re buying an iMac 21.5 inch 2.5GHz, you need to add more iMac RAM to the cheapest iMac in Apple&#8217;s iMac lineup. From the factory, this sleek consumer Mac ships with 4GB of RAM (2x2GB sdram dimms), but you should double the RAM to 8GB for maximum performance. Not too long ago, 8GB of iMac RAM would cost you as much as the computer itself, but ove time iMac RAM prices have really dropped and you now can fill this affordable iMac with all the RAM it can handle for the cost of a dinner and a movie.

You could do just fine with running 4GB of iMac RAM, and for some of you 4GB might be all the RAM you need, but as we enter the second half of the year, 8GB of RAM is so cheap for this computer it really is very good money spent on your computer, and in some instances better than adding more hard drive space to your iMac (you should have an external hard drive for backup) or even buying software as a lot of software you can get for free or work &#8216;in the cloud&#8217; where you don&#8217;t really need an application on your iMac above and beyond what&#8217;s included with the iMac at the store, such as iTunes and iPhoto, programs that allow you to organize your photos and music on your iMac.

**Cheapest iMac RAM Prices:

[table id=2 /]

The Apple iMac, and especially this model is one of the **[best iMac bargains][1],** if not one of the most well designed and stylish desktop computers available today. Offering quad core speed, these beautiful desktops are affordable and in some cases, when you add more RAM and a solid state drive to an iMac, faster than an Apple Mac Pro.

If you have, or are going to **[buy the iMac 21.5 inch 2.5GHz][1]**, do yourself a favor and buy ram that you can install yourself with easy to read and follow iMac RAM upgrade instructions that, if you&#8217;re careful you can do yourself [quite easily][2] and you won&#8217;t even void your warranty when installing iMac RAM.

**June 2012 Update:** This year in 2012 Apple offers a **pretty good deal for back to school purchases** from the [Apple Store][1].

When you purchase a Mac between June 11, 2012 and September 21, 2012  you&#8217;ll also get a $100 back to school gift card for use for Apps, Books, Movies or Music.

When you purchase an iPad between June 11, 2012 and September 21, 2012 you&#8217;re eligible for a $50 Back To School Gift Card

This back to school gift card offer is in addition to any Apple Education discounts you may be eligible for. Faculty and staff members from any grade level are also available for a discount.

**Apple Education Discount Qualifications**

To be eligible for an education discount from Apple you need to be a college student, a student accepted to a college or a parent buying a Mac or an iPad on behalf of a student for the upcoming year.

2012 Apple Education Discounts

Save up  to $200 of a MacBook Pro

Save up to $50 off a MacBook Air

Save up to $100 off an iMac

Interestingly, there is no discount for buying an iPad, but you still are entitled to the discount.

Overall, these are pretty good discounts and if you include the gift cards in the back to school promotions  from Apple this year you could save up to $200 and get a 100 dollar gift card &#8211; that&#8217;s a discount of  $300 when compared to buying  your Mac at tull price from the Apple Store.

<HR>

The [summer deal on Apple Mac Computers for Students][2], in my opinion this year isn&#8217;t half as good or enticing as it has been in previous years where you could **buy a Mac and get a free iPod** which would make for a more logical deal than this year&#8217;s offering that sees Apple promoting their App Store more than their iPod lineup.

The good news with this is that on [select Macs you can save up to $200][3] with educational prices being offered **AND you get $100 worth of software to start the school year off with** from Apple&#8217;s relatively new App Store, which might be a better deal for your pocketbook in the long term than in past years where you got an iPod for free.

MacBooks are available **starting at $899**, **MacBook Pro&#8217;s at $1099**, **MacBook Airs at  $949 **and **iMacs at $1149** which works out to the following discounts before you add the $100 App Store credit:

**MacBook : $100 savings**

**MacBook Pro: up to $200 savings**

**MacBook Air: save $50 **

**iMac: Save $100 **

One interesting  thing I noted with this deal is that the **Mac Mini, Apple&#8217;s cheapest Mac** isn&#8217;t listed, but I find  odd, considering students don&#8217;t have a lot of money to buy Apple computers  I thought that this would be one of the first choices for students entering college, as it &#8216;s currently  the cheapest Apple computer you can buy. Also, the only desktop available is the iMac. You don&#8217;t get educational pricing with this deal on the Mac Pro it seems.

RAM for all these computers cost a lot more money at Apple ([see MacBook Pro RAM Prices for example][4]) and you&#8217;re much better off if you [buy RAM][5] for much less with all the money you saved, and in the case of the MacBook Pro, you could [**fill the notebook with much cheaper RAM**,][6] and **still have $100 in your pocket plus the App Store credit** too if you **buy RAM for the MacBook Pros** that works just as well and is at the time I write this &#8211; over $300 cheaper than the memory  from the Apple Store. You might not get a **free iPod** as you may have in recent years, but you still could end up with what essentially could be a **free RAM Upgrade** for your back to school notebook computer, $100 in your pocket, and a $100 credit from the App Store too.

</p>

The** [Dell Inspiron 17R 2nd Generation starts at just $599 when you buy direct from Dell,][1]** and yet for  some reason it&#8217;s priced much  higher at Amazon where you can still buy a Dell 17inch Inspiron but it will cost you either $200 or $100 more

**Best RAM for Dell Inspiron**

**Inspiron 17R 2nd Gen Review**  
The **second generation of Dells** use either **intel i3, Intel i5, or Intel i7 processors** and depending on what processor you chose when configuring your big screen notebook, the cost may be higher than the  **$599 price advertised **when you buy from Dell directly as this model features **second generation i3 processors** which aren&#8217;t the fastest processor intel makes but is perfect for light computing duty such as email or web browsing. But if you&#8217;re working with a **17 inch notebook** there&#8217;s a good chance you you&#8217;ll be working with audio, video or other processor heavy tasks that require more speed and more importantly, **more RAM**.<img class="size-full wp-image-2234 alignnone" title="Cheapest Dell Inspiron 17R" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Screen-shot-2011-06-16-at-1.41.15-PM.png" alt="Deal on Dell Inspiron 17R " width="575" height="476" />

Out of the box, the **cheapest 17 inch Dell notebook** uses [DDR3 1333Mhz SDRAM][2] sodimms that out of the box ships with **4GB of memory uprades already installed,** which in mid-2011 is a useable amount  of RAM and for some who&#8217;s main computing task is [facebook][3] the **4GB DDR3** just might do you fine without any need to buy Dell memory upgrades for this 17 inch notebook aimed at the home and  home office market

But as I mentioned when I wrote about the smaller version of this dell inspiron model &#8211; the **[Dell Inspiron 15R 2nd generation][4]** notebook, and especially if you&#8217;ve got the big screen Dell, you&#8217;re either gaming or doing serious work on this Dell computer and **you&#8217;re going to need as much RAM as possible **to max out the Dell Inspiron 17R with RAM upgrades for a computer that could see a 50% speed increase all by adding $100 ([much less actually][5]) of RAM.

To **max out the RAM on the Dell Inspiron 17R **you need to remove the factory RAM (which you can sell online for  even more savings on memory. Try craigslist or eBay for selling you  factory installed Dell memory upgrades) and install bigger ram modules. Depending on your ram configuration, you could see either **2x2GB memory upgrades in your Dell**, or in some cases 1x2GB and 1x4GB ram upgrades. If you bought a Dell Inspiron 17R second generation you can stop reading now as you now have the fastest Dell notebook (or at least all the RAM the Dell can handle). For the rest of you, keep reading:

**Dell Inspiron 17R 2nd generation memory  upgrade installation**

Upgrading the ram on this **big screen beauty from Dell** couldn&#8217;t be easier. Flip  the notebook over, remove the battery and be sure you&#8217;re **free of any static electricity** as static is a RAM killer. You&#8217;re dealing with a **very expensive piece of electronics here**, and  **installing Dell memory is easy** but you do need to be sure you&#8217;re installing  RAM so you don&#8217;t fry your Dell or void the warranty. If you have any apprehension about **installing the memory yourself** you should take your Dell and your RAM to an authorized service center for Dell. Best Buy might be one place you can take your Dell for ram installation services.

But you really shouldn&#8217;t have to take the Dell anywhere to get RAM installed. With the battery out, and you static free, you remove the bottom plastic cover that hides the ram upgrade slots, which are easily accessible and within reach for  any easy RAM upgrade, and assuming you already have the new RAM in hand should only take you five minutes. On each end of the ram module are little plastic clips that when you pull them apart and away from RAM upgrade, allows the memory module to pop up in the memory slot at a 45 degree angle, which allows you to remove the factory RAM from the ram upgrade slot on the Dell Inspiron 17R.  Then you just repeat for the second memory module.

Once you have the RAM out of the Dell Inspiron 17r you can **install the new RAM you bought**, which is **[4GB DDR3 SDRAM SODIMMS][6]**. This RAM upgrade is  sold in **[8GB DDR3 memory upgrade Kits ][5]**which is easier to buy than individual ram upgrades and you usually get a **small discount on the memory upgrade kits** instead  of **buying the RAM upgrades individually**. The new RAM has a slot on it so you really can&#8217;t mess up the Dell memory upgrade installation, as long as you take caution with static electricity. Just seat the bigger RAM for Dell in the new ram sockets and when seated, the  RAM module should click into place using those two little tabs, screw the plastic cover back onto the bottom of your Dell Inspiron 17R 2nd Generation and replace the battery. Flip the Dell over, and  you&#8217;re done.

One thing  I should note is that any** RAM install should be done on a clean, dry and preferably soft surface** (a towel works great  so you don&#8217;t scratch the laptop  lid).

**Best Prices and Deals for Dell Inspiron 17R 2nd Generation Notebook Computers**

This is the one time where I suggest you **[buy this model of Dell notebook directly from Dell][7]**, as opposed to say, Amazon which does have **[deals and best prices on other 17 inch notebooks][8]** but if you&#8217;re in the market for this particular  Dell model, your best bet is probably  to **buy  the Dell Directly**. As I write this, Dell has a **[12 day summer sale going on][7]** which might get you an even better price on an everyday 17 inch notebook from Dell if you&#8217;re lucky.

The **[2nd generation of Dell Notebooks][1]** with a 15 inch LCD display offer two features over the [Dell Inspiron 15R N5010][2] and that&#8217;s a **faster processor inside this dell laptop** as well as (something I could care less about, but I&#8217;m probably not the market for this dell notebook anyway) and that&#8217;s the fact that the lids or top cover of this 15 inch notebook from **Dell offers switch lids**, and if you&#8217;ve got thirty bucks or so you can swap out the colors of your dell to personalize it further and make it stand out from other Dells, but I&#8217;d rather spend the switch lids money on something that will get you computing faster with the 2nd generation Dell 15R notebook computer, and that&#8217;s **adding more RAM**.

**Cheapest RAM Prices for Dell Inspiron 15R 2nd Generation**

<img src="http://i.dell.com/das/dih.ashx/314x314/images/global/products/314x314/inspiron-15r-right-black-alternate-314.jpg" alt="Dell Inspiron 15R Laptop Computer" border="0" />

This is probably one of the [best selling dell notebook computers][3] in 2011 thanks to the fact that it&#8217;s priced at under $500 at $499,  but I&#8217;d go and spend the additional $50 and buy the $549.00 Dell 15R as opposed to the older and slower model that doesn&#8217;t have as fast as a processor **when comparing the two 15 inch Dell notebooks side by side**.

At $549, the Dell packs a fair bit of notebook computer value and when you consider the fact a MacBook Pro 15 inch is $2000 or more &#8211;  a $500 notebook looks pretty good in 201.  The main features of the Dell Inspiron 15R  include the switch lids I mentioned above, but also is enabled for Widi and 3DTV that allows you to wirelessly project  your movies to your HDTV. You can buy the  Dell Inspiron 15R with 2nd generation Intel Core i7 processors, **more RAM**, bigger hard drives and add printers, monitors and other to your shopping cart, but at  $549 you&#8217;ll limited to an Intel Core i3 processor, **4GB of DDR3 1333Mhz RAM** which is actually a very usable RAM amount  and  for every day home use and web browsing like facebook, etc, it&#8217;s quite possible you won&#8217;t need to upgrade the RAM on the Dell Inspiron 15R.

But, I recommend two things: That you do buy more dell memory and you don&#8217;t buy  the RAM from Dell as it&#8217;s priced too much. 4GB DDR3 memory of which you&#8217;ll need two of to max out the RAM on a Dell 15R 2nd generation will set you back over $200 or more, where alternately you can **[buy the maximum RAM of 8GB for well under $100][4]** and save closer to $200 on Dell memory uprades, all by taking 5 minutes to  shop around for the best prices on RAM Upgrades from memory vendors you can trust and are reputable, as that&#8217;s the only kind of RAM and  memory I recommend.

All this advice only applies to saving money on RAM upgrades on the Dell Inspiron 2nd generation 15R (which looks like a great deal on a windows 7 notebook) and if you&#8217;ve got deep pockets or don&#8217;t have the time to install the ram yourself (it&#8217;s easy to do a memory upgrade  on most any Dell computer &#8211; just pop the battery out, and there&#8217;s a cover on the bottom of the notebook you remove to acesss the two memory upgrade slots available) then you may  be better off just configuring the RAM when you buy the Inspiron online from Dell, but for those of us that want to save money on Dell Memory Upgrades, regardless s of specific model number.

To upgrade the RAM on Dell Inspiron 15R 2nd generation you&#8217;ll need to **[buy two 4GB DDR3 1333mhz sodimms][5]**, usually sold in **[8GB notebook memory upgrade kits][4]** that make it easy to upgrade the two slots available for upgrade on this affordable Dell designed for every day home and small office use.

**Dell Inspiron 15R 2nd Generation Deals and Best Prices **

Your best bet for a **deal on a dell notebook** is to buy it [directly from Dell][1] where you can configure your dell laptop with added software such as [Microsoft Home and Office][6], faster processors, bigger hard drives and even add extra switchable lids if that&#8217;s your thing, but I also recommend you check out Amazon for the **[best notebook computer deals][7]** as well.

Perfect for father&#8217;s day or a graduation present, the <a href="http://www.jdoqocy.com/click-1548159-10550055?url=http%3A%2F%2Flt.dell.com%2Flt%2Flt.aspx%3FACD%3D%25za-%25zp-%25zs%26AID%3D%25zp%26CID%3D24471%26LID%3D566643%26DGC%3DCJ%26DGSeg%3DDHS%26DURL%3DHTTP%3A%2F%2Fconfigure.us.dell.com%2Fdellstore%2Fconfig.aspx%3Foc%3Dfncor05%2526cs%3D19%2526c%3DUS%2526l%3DEN%2526m_29%3DFQ1O&cjsku=FNCOR05_1" target="_top">Dell Inspiron 15R N5010</a> is the first generation 15R notebook from Dell and is not to be confused with newer and obviously faster Dell Inspiron 15R that features Intel Core processors and offers a faster computing experience than the older, but cheaper Dell 15R.

But for everyday computing, this **fast dell notebook** with a market value of $519.99, but on sale today for $449.00 is more than enough computer for those that don&#8217;t want to scrimp on screen size but don&#8217;t want to pay over $500 for a notebook computer with a 15 inch LCD display.

Because you&#8217;re ordering a new computer from Dell, you can customize the <a href="http://www.jdoqocy.com/click-1548159-10550055?url=http%3A%2F%2Flt.dell.com%2Flt%2Flt.aspx%3FACD%3D%25za-%25zp-%25zs%26AID%3D%25zp%26CID%3D24471%26LID%3D566643%26DGC%3DCJ%26DGSeg%3DDHS%26DURL%3DHTTP%3A%2F%2Fconfigure.us.dell.com%2Fdellstore%2Fconfig.aspx%3Foc%3Dfncor05%2526cs%3D19%2526c%3DUS%2526l%3DEN%2526m_29%3DFQ1O&cjsku=FNCOR05_1" target="_top">Dell Inspiron 15R N5010</a> to your heart&#8217;s content and buy not only the notebook but add anti virus software, upgrade the processor from Intel Core i3 to Intel Core i5 and select bigger hard drive and memory options but you&#8217;re better off buying the RAM for your Dell Inspiron 15R online and installing the memory yourself. **Why? You&#8217;ll save money on RAM this way**.<img alt="Dell Inspiron 15R Laptop Computer" src="http://i.dell.com/das/dih.ashx/314x314/images/global/products/314x314/inspiron-15r-right-black-alternate-314.jpg" border="0" />

Dell Inspiron 15R N5010 notebooks, regardless of what hard drive, software and other notebook accessories you end up buying and adding to your dell shopping cart all use the same type of memory, and that&#8217;s DDR3 1333Mhz sodimms and by replacing the factory installed ram using two **[4GB DDR3 SDRAM sodimms][2]** or even better: **[buy an 8GB Memory Upgrade Kit for the Dell Inspiron 15R][2]**and have the most memory you can possibly install into the Dell Inspiron 15R N51010 for much less than what Dell will charge you for memory upgrades for this particular notebook computer, and at time of writing this, this works about to paying half price for the RAM for your Dell notebook, as there&#8217;s a very good chance if you buy a Dell notebook in 2011 you&#8217;ll need **[8GB Memory Upgrade Kits][2]** to max out the ram on all Dell Notebook Models.

<br>

		<div class="post-content">The short answer to how much memory you need &#8211; regardless of computer manufacturer &#8211; Mac or PC, is you **need as much memory as possible**

There&#8217;s a good chance that you need to upgrade the laptop you&#8217;re using to read this with, as out of the box and direct from the factory, unless you bought a CTO (configured to order) PC that you chose to fill your laptop with, there&#8217;s a good chance the RAM you have installed is just enough to RUN the operating systems and not much else. 

Apple Mac OS Snow Leopards Minimum RAM Requirements are 1GB, and 5GB of hard drive space, yet that is JUST for the operating system to RUN, and not much else, including the iApps such as iTunes, iPhoto and the like. And if you need to run Aperture or any processor intensive application that uses memory then the minimum recommended ram of 1GB for MacOS 

On the Windows side of things, you&#8217;ll need even more memory. 1GB will do you for running 32 bit Windows 7, but if you need 64 bit Microsoft Windows for your laptop OS then 2GB is the minimum RAM you should have installed 

As you can see, 1GB or even 2GB really isn&#8217;t a whole lot of RAM if you want to do anything with your computer than start it up. (try installing windows 7 or even Mac OS on a 1GB laptop and you&#8217;ll see what I mean) 

In 2011, the minimum RAM I would recommend for every day computing is 4GB. 8GB is better if your notebook computer can accomodate the larger memory size, but if you&#8217;re looking to buy and upgrade a notebook computer in 2011 you&#8217;re best to max out your laptop to 8GB if you can. 

**Best RAM Prices for Laptops.  
**

There&#8217;s a very good chance your laptop takes DDR3 1333Mhz memory upgrades and below is a table of the best notebook prices I have found on sale from memory stores you can trust that are much much cheaper than if you bought the memory from the PC manufacturers directly.

[Not much at all. ][1]

You can double the RAM in your MBP to 4GB very easily and cheaply just by adding more memory. You&#8217;ll  need to buy new ram upgrades and replace the ram  in your MacBook Pro &#8211; currently 2x1GB MacBook Pro RAM  with larger 2&#215;2 GB RAM for MacBook Pros but the cost is negligible, especially if you are making your living with your MacBook Pro adding another 2gb of RAM will be like breathing a breath of fresh air into now what will be a discontinued MacBook Pro, as the current MBP&#8217;s take 8GB of DDR3 SDRAM.

I don&#8217;t know what specific model of MacBook Pro you&#8217;re looking to ugprade, but you should  be able to do so for not  much money at all. MacBook Pro models that accept 4GB are now, in 2011 a few years old and you could be looking to squeeze more life out of a 2009, 2010 or even 2008 MacBook Pro notebook, as these all max out with 4GB of memory.

You&#8217;ll be in the market for DDR3 1066 SDRAM dimms and a s you can see by the MacBook Pro RAM Price chart below RAM for MacBooks is cheaper than it has ever been before and  continues to drop in price over time, so if you want, you can wait until ram prices fall even further. But the disadvantage of this approach is that your&#8217;e sacrificing your time over money when the benefit of the ram will far outweigh the costs of a 4GB RAM upgrade for a MacBook Pro.
