<p><strong>June 2012 Update:</strong> This year in 2012 Apple offers a <strong>pretty good deal for back to school purchases</strong> from the <a href="http://store.apple.com/us/browse/campaigns/back_to_school">Apple Store</a>.</p>

<p>When you purchase a Mac between June 11, 2012 and September 21, 2012  you’ll also get a $100 back to school gift card for use for Apps, Books, Movies or Music.</p>

<p>When you purchase an iPad between June 11, 2012 and September 21, 2012 you’re eligible for a $50 Back To School Gift Card</p>

<p>This back to school gift card offer is in addition to any Apple Education discounts you may be eligible for. Faculty and staff members from any grade level are also available for a discount.</p>

<p><strong>Apple Education Discount Qualifications</strong></p>

<p>To be eligible for an education discount from Apple you need to be a college student, a student accepted to a college or a parent buying a Mac or an iPad on behalf of a student for the upcoming year.</p>

<p>2012 Apple Education Discounts</p>

<p>Save up  to $200 of a MacBook Pro</p>

<p>Save up to $50 off a MacBook Air</p>

<p>Save up to $100 off an iMac</p>

<p>Interestingly, there is no discount for buying an iPad, but you still are entitled to the discount.</p>

<p>Overall, these are pretty good discounts and if you include the gift cards in the back to school promotions  from Apple this year you could save up to $200 and get a 100 dollar gift card – that’s a discount of  $300 when compared to buying  your Mac at tull price from the Apple Store.</p>

<hr />

<p>The <a href="http://store.apple.com/us/browse/campaigns/back_to_school?aid=www-naus-bts2011-0526-14" title="summer back to school apple deal">summer deal on Apple Mac Computers for Students</a>, in my opinion this year isn’t half as good or enticing as it has been in previous years where you could <strong>buy a Mac and get a free iPod</strong> which would make for a more logical deal than this year’s offering that sees Apple promoting their App Store more than their iPod lineup.</p>

<p>The good news with this is that on <a href="http://store.apple.com/us/browse/campaigns/back_to_school?aid=www-naus-bts2011-0526-14">select Macs you can save up to $200</a> with educational prices being offered <strong>AND you get $100 worth of software to start the school year off with</strong> from Apple’s relatively new App Store, which might be a better deal for your pocketbook in the long term than in past years where you got an iPod for free.</p>

<p>MacBooks are available <strong>starting at $899</strong>, <strong>MacBook Pro’s at $1099</strong>, <strong>MacBook Airs at  $949 **and **iMacs at $1149</strong> which works out to the following discounts before you add the $100 App Store credit:</p>

<p><strong>MacBook : $100 savings</strong></p>

<p><strong>MacBook Pro: up to $200 savings</strong></p>

<p>**MacBook Air: save $50 **</p>

<p>**iMac: Save $100 **</p>

<p>One interesting  thing I noted with this deal is that the <strong>Mac Mini, Apple’s cheapest Mac</strong> isn’t listed, but I find  odd, considering students don’t have a lot of money to buy Apple computers  I thought that this would be one of the first choices for students entering college, as it ‘s currently  the cheapest Apple computer you can buy. Also, the only desktop available is the iMac. You don’t get educational pricing with this deal on the Mac Pro it seems.</p>

<p>RAM for all these computers cost a lot more money at Apple (<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/macbook-pro-ddr3-1333mhz-memory-upgrade-prices/">see MacBook Pro RAM Prices for example</a>) and you’re much better off if you <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com" title="buy ram">buy RAM</a> for much less with all the money you saved, and in the case of the MacBook Pro, you could <a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT2KIT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1339"><strong>fill the notebook with much cheaper RAM</strong>,</a> and <strong>still have $100 in your pocket plus the App Store credit</strong> too if you <strong>buy RAM for the MacBook Pros</strong> that works just as well and is at the time I write this – over $300 cheaper than the memory  from the Apple Store. You might not get a <strong>free iPod</strong> as you may have in recent years, but you still could end up with what essentially could be a <strong>free RAM Upgrade</strong> for your back to school notebook computer, $100 in your pocket, and a $100 credit from the App Store too.</p>

</p>

<p>The** <a href="http://www.kqzyfj.com/click-1548159-10715248">Dell Inspiron 17R 2nd Generation starts at just $599 when you buy direct from Dell,</a>** and yet for  some reason it’s priced much  higher at Amazon where you can still buy a Dell 17inch Inspiron but it will cost you either $200 or $100 more</p>

<p><strong>Best RAM for Dell Inspiron</strong></p>

<p><strong>Inspiron 17R 2nd Gen Review</strong><br />
The <strong>second generation of Dells</strong> use either <strong>intel i3, Intel i5, or Intel i7 processors</strong> and depending on what processor you chose when configuring your big screen notebook, the cost may be higher than the  <strong>$599 price advertised **when you buy from Dell directly as this model features **second generation i3 processors</strong> which aren’t the fastest processor intel makes but is perfect for light computing duty such as email or web browsing. But if you’re working with a <strong>17 inch notebook</strong> there’s a good chance you you’ll be working with audio, video or other processor heavy tasks that require more speed and more importantly, <strong>more RAM</strong>.<img class="size-full wp-image-2234 alignnone" title="Cheapest Dell Inspiron 17R" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Screen-shot-2011-06-16-at-1.41.15-PM.png" alt="Deal on Dell Inspiron 17R " width="575" height="476" /></p>

<p>Out of the box, the <strong>cheapest 17 inch Dell notebook</strong> uses <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/best-prices-for-notebook-memory-ddr3-1333mhz-204-pin-sodimms/" title="Best Prices for Notebook Memory: DDR3 1333Mhz 204 Pin SODIMMS">DDR3 1333Mhz SDRAM</a> sodimms that out of the box ships with <strong>4GB of memory uprades already installed,</strong> which in mid-2011 is a useable amount  of RAM and for some who’s main computing task is <a href="http://www.facebook.com">facebook</a> the <strong>4GB DDR3</strong> just might do you fine without any need to buy Dell memory upgrades for this 17 inch notebook aimed at the home and  home office market</p>

<p>But as I mentioned when I wrote about the smaller version of this dell inspiron model – the <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/dell-inspiron-15r-2nd-generation-laptop-memory-upgrades/" title="best dell 15 inch notebook">Dell Inspiron 15R 2nd generation</a></strong> notebook, and especially if you’ve got the big screen Dell, you’re either gaming or doing serious work on this Dell computer and **you’re going to need as much RAM as possible **to max out the Dell Inspiron 17R with RAM upgrades for a computer that could see a 50% speed increase all by adding $100 (<a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT2KIT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1339">much less actually</a>) of RAM.</p>

<p>To <strong>max out the RAM on the Dell Inspiron 17R **you need to remove the factory RAM (which you can sell online for  even more savings on memory. Try craigslist or eBay for selling you  factory installed Dell memory upgrades) and install bigger ram modules. Depending on your ram configuration, you could see either **2x2GB memory upgrades in your Dell</strong>, or in some cases 1x2GB and 1x4GB ram upgrades. If you bought a Dell Inspiron 17R second generation you can stop reading now as you now have the fastest Dell notebook (or at least all the RAM the Dell can handle). For the rest of you, keep reading:</p>

<p><strong>Dell Inspiron 17R 2nd generation memory  upgrade installation</strong></p>

<p>Upgrading the ram on this <strong>big screen beauty from Dell</strong> couldn’t be easier. Flip  the notebook over, remove the battery and be sure you’re <strong>free of any static electricity</strong> as static is a RAM killer. You’re dealing with a <strong>very expensive piece of electronics here</strong>, and  <strong>installing Dell memory is easy</strong> but you do need to be sure you’re installing  RAM so you don’t fry your Dell or void the warranty. If you have any apprehension about <strong>installing the memory yourself</strong> you should take your Dell and your RAM to an authorized service center for Dell. Best Buy might be one place you can take your Dell for ram installation services.</p>

<p>But you really shouldn’t have to take the Dell anywhere to get RAM installed. With the battery out, and you static free, you remove the bottom plastic cover that hides the ram upgrade slots, which are easily accessible and within reach for  any easy RAM upgrade, and assuming you already have the new RAM in hand should only take you five minutes. On each end of the ram module are little plastic clips that when you pull them apart and away from RAM upgrade, allows the memory module to pop up in the memory slot at a 45 degree angle, which allows you to remove the factory RAM from the ram upgrade slot on the Dell Inspiron 17R.  Then you just repeat for the second memory module.</p>

<p>Once you have the RAM out of the Dell Inspiron 17r you can <strong>install the new RAM you bought</strong>, which is <strong><a href="http://www.dpbolvw.net/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT51264BC1339">4GB DDR3 SDRAM SODIMMS</a></strong>. This RAM upgrade is  sold in <strong><a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT2KIT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1339">8GB DDR3 memory upgrade Kits </a></strong>which is easier to buy than individual ram upgrades and you usually get a <strong>small discount on the memory upgrade kits</strong> instead  of <strong>buying the RAM upgrades individually</strong>. The new RAM has a slot on it so you really can’t mess up the Dell memory upgrade installation, as long as you take caution with static electricity. Just seat the bigger RAM for Dell in the new ram sockets and when seated, the  RAM module should click into place using those two little tabs, screw the plastic cover back onto the bottom of your Dell Inspiron 17R 2nd Generation and replace the battery. Flip the Dell over, and  you’re done.</p>

<p>One thing  I should note is that any** RAM install should be done on a clean, dry and preferably soft surface** (a towel works great  so you don’t scratch the laptop  lid).</p>

<p><strong>Best Prices and Deals for Dell Inspiron 17R 2nd Generation Notebook Computers</strong></p>

<p>This is the one time where I suggest you <strong><a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10639500">buy this model of Dell notebook directly from Dell</a></strong>, as opposed to say, Amazon which does have <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26x%3D0%26ref_%3Dnb_sb_noss%26y%3D0%26field-keywords%3D17%2520inch%2520laptop%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps%23&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">deals and best prices on other 17 inch notebooks</a></strong> but if you’re in the market for this particular  Dell model, your best bet is probably  to <strong>buy  the Dell Directly</strong>. As I write this, Dell has a <strong><a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10639500">12 day summer sale going on</a></strong> which might get you an even better price on an everyday 17 inch notebook from Dell if you’re lucky.</p>

<p>The <strong><a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10639500">2nd generation of Dell Notebooks</a></strong> with a 15 inch LCD display offer two features over the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/dell-inspiron-15r-n5010-memory-upgrades/" title="dell inspiron N5010 RAM">Dell Inspiron 15R N5010</a> and that’s a <strong>faster processor inside this dell laptop</strong> as well as (something I could care less about, but I’m probably not the market for this dell notebook anyway) and that’s the fact that the lids or top cover of this 15 inch notebook from <strong>Dell offers switch lids</strong>, and if you’ve got thirty bucks or so you can swap out the colors of your dell to personalize it further and make it stand out from other Dells, but I’d rather spend the switch lids money on something that will get you computing faster with the 2nd generation Dell 15R notebook computer, and that’s <strong>adding more RAM</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Cheapest RAM Prices for Dell Inspiron 15R 2nd Generation</strong></p>

<p><img src="http://i.dell.com/das/dih.ashx/314x314/images/global/products/314x314/inspiron-15r-right-black-alternate-314.jpg" alt="Dell Inspiron 15R Laptop Computer" border="0" /></p>

<p>This is probably one of the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/what-is-the-best-computer-brand-to-buy/" title="What is the Best Computer Brand to Buy?">best selling dell notebook computers</a> in 2011 thanks to the fact that it’s priced at under $500 at $499,  but I’d go and spend the additional $50 and buy the $549.00 Dell 15R as opposed to the older and slower model that doesn’t have as fast as a processor <strong>when comparing the two 15 inch Dell notebooks side by side</strong>.</p>

<p>At $549, the Dell packs a fair bit of notebook computer value and when you consider the fact a MacBook Pro 15 inch is $2000 or more –  a $500 notebook looks pretty good in 201.  The main features of the Dell Inspiron 15R  include the switch lids I mentioned above, but also is enabled for Widi and 3DTV that allows you to wirelessly project  your movies to your HDTV. You can buy the  Dell Inspiron 15R with 2nd generation Intel Core i7 processors, <strong>more RAM</strong>, bigger hard drives and add printers, monitors and other to your shopping cart, but at  $549 you’ll limited to an Intel Core i3 processor, <strong>4GB of DDR3 1333Mhz RAM</strong> which is actually a very usable RAM amount  and  for every day home use and web browsing like facebook, etc, it’s quite possible you won’t need to upgrade the RAM on the Dell Inspiron 15R.</p>

<p>But, I recommend two things: That you do buy more dell memory and you don’t buy  the RAM from Dell as it’s priced too much. 4GB DDR3 memory of which you’ll need two of to max out the RAM on a Dell 15R 2nd generation will set you back over $200 or more, where alternately you can <strong><a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT2KIT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1339">buy the maximum RAM of 8GB for well under $100</a></strong> and save closer to $200 on Dell memory uprades, all by taking 5 minutes to  shop around for the best prices on RAM Upgrades from memory vendors you can trust and are reputable, as that’s the only kind of RAM and  memory I recommend.</p>

<p>All this advice only applies to saving money on RAM upgrades on the Dell Inspiron 2nd generation 15R (which looks like a great deal on a windows 7 notebook) and if you’ve got deep pockets or don’t have the time to install the ram yourself (it’s easy to do a memory upgrade  on most any Dell computer – just pop the battery out, and there’s a cover on the bottom of the notebook you remove to acesss the two memory upgrade slots available) then you may  be better off just configuring the RAM when you buy the Inspiron online from Dell, but for those of us that want to save money on Dell Memory Upgrades, regardless s of specific model number.</p>

<p>To upgrade the RAM on Dell Inspiron 15R 2nd generation you’ll need to <strong><a href="http://www.dpbolvw.net/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT51264BC1339">buy two 4GB DDR3 1333mhz sodimms</a></strong>, usually sold in <strong><a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT2KIT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1339">8GB notebook memory upgrade kits</a></strong> that make it easy to upgrade the two slots available for upgrade on this affordable Dell designed for every day home and small office use.</p>

<p>**Dell Inspiron 15R 2nd Generation Deals and Best Prices **</p>

<p>Your best bet for a <strong>deal on a dell notebook</strong> is to buy it <a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10639500">directly from Dell</a> where you can configure your dell laptop with added software such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0050PJB32/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B0050PJB32">Microsoft Home and Office</a>, faster processors, bigger hard drives and even add extra switchable lids if that’s your thing, but I also recommend you check out Amazon for the <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fbestsellers%2Felectronics%2F565108%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref_%3Dzg_bs_nav%23&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">best notebook computer deals</a></strong> as well.</p>

<p>Perfect for father’s day or a graduation present, the <a href="http://www.jdoqocy.com/click-1548159-10550055?url=http%3A%2F%2Flt.dell.com%2Flt%2Flt.aspx%3FACD%3D%25za-%25zp-%25zs%26AID%3D%25zp%26CID%3D24471%26LID%3D566643%26DGC%3DCJ%26DGSeg%3DDHS%26DURL%3DHTTP%3A%2F%2Fconfigure.us.dell.com%2Fdellstore%2Fconfig.aspx%3Foc%3Dfncor05%2526cs%3D19%2526c%3DUS%2526l%3DEN%2526m_29%3DFQ1O&amp;cjsku=FNCOR05_1" target="_top">Dell Inspiron 15R N5010</a> is the first generation 15R notebook from Dell and is not to be confused with newer and obviously faster Dell Inspiron 15R that features Intel Core processors and offers a faster computing experience than the older, but cheaper Dell 15R.</p>

<p>But for everyday computing, this <strong>fast dell notebook</strong> with a market value of $519.99, but on sale today for $449.00 is more than enough computer for those that don’t want to scrimp on screen size but don’t want to pay over $500 for a notebook computer with a 15 inch LCD display.</p>

<p>Because you’re ordering a new computer from Dell, you can customize the <a href="http://www.jdoqocy.com/click-1548159-10550055?url=http%3A%2F%2Flt.dell.com%2Flt%2Flt.aspx%3FACD%3D%25za-%25zp-%25zs%26AID%3D%25zp%26CID%3D24471%26LID%3D566643%26DGC%3DCJ%26DGSeg%3DDHS%26DURL%3DHTTP%3A%2F%2Fconfigure.us.dell.com%2Fdellstore%2Fconfig.aspx%3Foc%3Dfncor05%2526cs%3D19%2526c%3DUS%2526l%3DEN%2526m_29%3DFQ1O&amp;cjsku=FNCOR05_1" target="_top">Dell Inspiron 15R N5010</a> to your heart’s content and buy not only the notebook but add anti virus software, upgrade the processor from Intel Core i3 to Intel Core i5 and select bigger hard drive and memory options but you’re better off buying the RAM for your Dell Inspiron 15R online and installing the memory yourself. <strong>Why? You’ll save money on RAM this way</strong>.<img alt="Dell Inspiron 15R Laptop Computer" src="http://i.dell.com/das/dih.ashx/314x314/images/global/products/314x314/inspiron-15r-right-black-alternate-314.jpg" border="0" /></p>

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>The short answer to how much memory you need – regardless of computer manufacturer – Mac or PC, is you <strong>need as much memory as possible</strong></p>

<p>There’s a good chance that you need to upgrade the laptop you’re using to read this with, as out of the box and direct from the factory, unless you bought a CTO (configured to order) PC that you chose to fill your laptop with, there’s a good chance the RAM you have installed is just enough to RUN the operating systems and not much else.</p>

<p>Apple Mac OS Snow Leopards Minimum RAM Requirements are 1GB, and 5GB of hard drive space, yet that is JUST for the operating system to RUN, and not much else, including the iApps such as iTunes, iPhoto and the like. And if you need to run Aperture or any processor intensive application that uses memory then the minimum recommended ram of 1GB for MacOS</p>

<p>On the Windows side of things, you’ll need even more memory. 1GB will do you for running 32 bit Windows 7, but if you need 64 bit Microsoft Windows for your laptop OS then 2GB is the minimum RAM you should have installed</p>

<p>As you can see, 1GB or even 2GB really isn’t a whole lot of RAM if you want to do anything with your computer than start it up. (try installing windows 7 or even Mac OS on a 1GB laptop and you’ll see what I mean)</p>

<p>In 2011, the minimum RAM I would recommend for every day computing is 4GB. 8GB is better if your notebook computer can accomodate the larger memory size, but if you’re looking to buy and upgrade a notebook computer in 2011 you’re best to max out your laptop to 8GB if you can.</p>

<p>**Best RAM Prices for Laptops.<br />
**</p>

<p>There’s a very good chance your laptop takes DDR3 1333Mhz memory upgrades and below is a table of the best notebook prices I have found on sale from memory stores you can trust that are much much cheaper than if you bought the memory from the PC manufacturers directly.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">Not much at all. </a></p>

<p>You can double the RAM in your MBP to 4GB very easily and cheaply just by adding more memory. You’ll  need to buy new ram upgrades and replace the ram  in your MacBook Pro – currently 2x1GB MacBook Pro RAM  with larger 2×2 GB RAM for MacBook Pros but the cost is negligible, especially if you are making your living with your MacBook Pro adding another 2gb of RAM will be like breathing a breath of fresh air into now what will be a discontinued MacBook Pro, as the current MBP’s take 8GB of DDR3 SDRAM.</p>

<p>I don’t know what specific model of MacBook Pro you’re looking to ugprade, but you should  be able to do so for not  much money at all. MacBook Pro models that accept 4GB are now, in 2011 a few years old and you could be looking to squeeze more life out of a 2009, 2010 or even 2008 MacBook Pro notebook, as these all max out with 4GB of memory.</p>

<p>You’ll be in the market for DDR3 1066 SDRAM dimms and a s you can see by the MacBook Pro RAM Price chart below RAM for MacBooks is cheaper than it has ever been before and  continues to drop in price over time, so if you want, you can wait until ram prices fall even further. But the disadvantage of this approach is that your’e sacrificing your time over money when the benefit of the ram will far outweigh the costs of a 4GB RAM upgrade for a MacBook Pro.</p>

<p>The HP DV6 notebook computer lineup comes in many different models and configurations  and has been a popular notebook computer from HP for some time, but I want to concentrate today on the newest and latest HP DV6 series notebooks as these are one of the best selling HP notebooks available today and run either i3, i5, or i7 Intel Core processors and when it comes to ram for the 2011 HP DV6 notebook lineup your best deal and correct RAM to buy is DDR3 1066MHz sdram sodimms.</p>

<p>Out of the box, whether you buy a HP DV6 series notebook from Best Buy, or  Amazon or even from HP directly this notebook comes shipped from the factory various with standard memory configurations depending on processor speed and model number, but  the maximum RAM for the HP DV6 notebooks stays the same at 8GB and unless you buy your HP completely configured with the maximum ram already installed that while is probably the easiest way to upgrade ram on this HP notebook, it’s far from the cheapest and you’re much better off  buying HP DV6 memory from a trusted memory store that guarantees the RAM to work just fine in your HP notebook, but for far less money than what you could expect to spend  on a HP memory upgrade.</p>

<p>**HP DV6 series NoteBook Computer RAM Prices **</p>

<p>[table id=8 /]</p>

<p>As you can see from above, the  prices above for HP DV6 ram and memory upgrades are quite reasonable with  an 8GB ram upgrade costing today less than $100 which is the maximum memory allowed on this notebook computer using two available memory upgrade slots.</p>

<p>To maximize the memory on your HP DV6 notebook  you will need to replace the memory currently installed  in your HP notebook and replace the memory upgrade modules with larger memory upgrade modules (<a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-1548159-10273954?url=http://www.crucial.com/store/affiliateredirect.asp?imodule=CT2KIT51264BC1067&amp;aid=1027395&amp;cid=777292&amp;subid=89&amp;PRS&amp;uscj&amp;cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1067">currently 8GB memory</a>), and after doing so, you will enjoy one of the fastest HP notebooks priced well under $700, just by adding more memory to your HP DV6 series notebook computer by HP.</p>

<p>I, at close to 15 years doing this – writing and tracking ram prices and memory upgrades from reputable ram vendors – I have come to realize one thing, and that’s ram gets cheaper and the standard or maximum ram size gets bigger.</p>

<p>It doesn’t seem too long ago, that a big deal with a memory upgrade was 256mb. Now that small amount of memory isn’t even an option for computers in 2011 regardless or make or manufacturer and as the years go by and the OS’s – both Mac and PC – get more and more bloated with prettier buttons and fancier features you can be sure of one thing, and that’s that all this stuff requires more RAM or memory.</p>

<p><strong>How Much Memory is Enough?</strong></p>

<p>In 2011, if you are going to make the effort and expense to upgrade the ram on your Mac or PC, I would start at 8GB, and if you have a modern computer (ie: Intel Core i3, i5, i7) then you will have no problem with adding 8GB of RAM to most modern computers today, especially for desktop computers.</p>

<p>Notebook computers on the other hand due mostly to the fact that there’s not a whole lot of space to put a memory ugprade, are a bit trickier to upgrade the RAM on, but again – 8GB RAM maximums are common on most notebook PC’s built today and although still pricey – costing as much as the notebook computer the memory is being installed in – 16GB RAM will be the defacto memory upgrade as the components for 16gb memory get cheaper over time. It wasn’t that long ago that installing 8gb of RAM in a notebook computer would cost you well over one thousand dollars, but now you can buy 8GB of notebook RAM for under $100.</p>

<p>You might be very happy running your computer with the RAM that it came from the factory and if all your computing needs happen in a web browser. (mine do) than the default 3GB or 4GB your notebook came with could very well be enough memory for facebook and the like.</p>

<p>But,if you make a living with your computer (I do, again) then 8GB is where I’d go when it comes to ram upgrades in 2011. With RAM so cheap (see ram price list below), especially for notebook computers and if you make a living with it, or just a serious hobbyist then 8GB ram upgrades from an array of memory stores are available for purchase, and all at significant savings when you compare the ram prices demanded by the computer manufacturers</p>

<p>Adding 8GB  of iMac RAM to a 4GB iMac depends on what specific Apple iMac you are looking at upgrading and even when it is possible, I don’t suggest it as it’s my thought that considering how cheap iMac RAM is these days, you’d be better off doing one of two upgrades:</p>

<p>For iMacs that can only accept 8GB as maximum memory and assuming your iMac ships from the factory with 4GB filling the memory slots (we’re going to assume your iMac only has two memory upgrade slots which was the case with older iMac released prior to summer 2010) you’ll have to replace the 2x2GB memory upgrades with 2x4GB memory modules to hit 8GB</p>

<p>But if you can hit 16GB on your iMac I suggest you maximize the RAM on your newer iMac (summer 2010 and  later) with the maximum memory allowed which at time of writing is 16GB of iMac RAM.</p>

<p>Adding 8GB of iMac RAM to 4GB, while in some iMac configurations is possible, doesn’t make a bunch of sense to me when for under $200 you can completely fill your iMac with the most ram it can handle.</p>

<p>For additional savings on your iMac RAM purchase you can even sell back the iMac RAM you had from the factory for even more savings off your $200 Apple iMac  RAM upgrade total price.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/OWC">OWC </a>will buy back your RAM and at the time I write this will pay you $27 for your 4GB of RAM on 2010 and 2011 Apple iMac models, that if you apply to the total cost of your new iMac 16GB upgrade (two 8GB ddr3 memory upgrade kits are required) you could have your new iMac filled with RAM for a touch over $150.00, (plus taxes, and shipping fees)</p>

<p>And speaking of fees for shipping, most online vendors offer free shipping on this much memory for iMacs, not to mention the out of state tax savings you could be eligible for as well in some cases.</p>

<p>So to answer your question: Yes you can add 8GB of iMac RAM but you’re better off either saving more money on RAM and only adding an additional 4GB or go all out and fill your iMac with as much RAM as possible, which is 16GB of iMac RAM</p>

<p>Here’s the current best and lowest RAM prices for iMac to help you decide on what size memory upgrade to get for your iMac</p>

<p>The Apple MacBook Pro 2.66, while now in 2011 is a discontinued Apple computer model, it’s still a bargain to <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com">upgrade the RAM </a>on this powerful notebook from  Apple with a 2.66GHz Intel Core i7 and I’m not the only one that thinks this, as this particular memory upgrade is one of the best selling ram upgrades you can buy today.</p>

<p><strong>RAM Specifications for Apple MacBook Pro 2.66</strong></p>

<p>The Apple MacBook Pro 2.66 17 inch notebook shipped from Apple  with just 4GB of RAM installed at the factory, but you can easily double the RAM on this notebook computer by buying 2x4GB memory modules, or  if you prefer an 8GB  memory upgrade kit  for MacBook Pro to max out the memory on this specific MacBook Pro Model using the two upgrade slots available in the MacBook Pro. You do have to replace the factory installed 2x2GB ram modules with the larger 4GB memory upgrades as there’s very little room inside a MacBook Pro  as apposed to a desktop system that allows for more ram capacity and memory configuration choices.</p>

<p>**How to Install MacBook Pro 2.66 GHz Intel Core i7 RAM **</p>

<p>It’s really easy to install the memory yourself on the MacBook Pro 2.66Ghz and if you buy quality ram and take your time on the ram install and guard against static electricity the result will be a faster MacBook Pro than before, which is one of the reasons for a memory upgrade in the first place.</p>

<p>Apple will even provide you with <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1270">handy instructions</a> on how to perform the upgrade of your MacBook Pro 2.66Ghz step by step and althogh this may not apply anymore, depending on whether you bought AppleCare for your 2010 MacBook Pro will not void your warranty either.</p>

<p>It’s really a  simple  upgrade and memory prices haven’t been cheaper ever, so now’s the time to <strong><a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-1548159-10273954?url=http://www.crucial.com/store/affiliateredirect.asp?imodule=CT2KIT51264BC1067&amp;aid=1027395&amp;cid=777292&amp;subid=89&amp;PRS&amp;uscj&amp;cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1067">max out the ram on your MacBook Pro 2.66 Ghz </a></strong>to 8GB and enjoy a faster and smoother running MacBook Pro 2.66Ghz as a result.</p>
