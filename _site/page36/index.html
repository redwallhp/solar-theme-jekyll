<p>The <strong><a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10639500">2nd generation of Dell Notebooks</a></strong> with a 15 inch LCD display offer two features over the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/dell-inspiron-15r-n5010-memory-upgrades/" title="dell inspiron N5010 RAM">Dell Inspiron 15R N5010</a> and that’s a <strong>faster processor inside this dell laptop</strong> as well as (something I could care less about, but I’m probably not the market for this dell notebook anyway) and that’s the fact that the lids or top cover of this 15 inch notebook from <strong>Dell offers switch lids</strong>, and if you’ve got thirty bucks or so you can swap out the colors of your dell to personalize it further and make it stand out from other Dells, but I’d rather spend the switch lids money on something that will get you computing faster with the 2nd generation Dell 15R notebook computer, and that’s <strong>adding more RAM</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Cheapest RAM Prices for Dell Inspiron 15R 2nd Generation</strong></p>

<p><img src="http://i.dell.com/das/dih.ashx/314x314/images/global/products/314x314/inspiron-15r-right-black-alternate-314.jpg" alt="Dell Inspiron 15R Laptop Computer" border="0" /></p>

<p>This is probably one of the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/what-is-the-best-computer-brand-to-buy/" title="What is the Best Computer Brand to Buy?">best selling dell notebook computers</a> in 2011 thanks to the fact that it’s priced at under $500 at $499,  but I’d go and spend the additional $50 and buy the $549.00 Dell 15R as opposed to the older and slower model that doesn’t have as fast as a processor <strong>when comparing the two 15 inch Dell notebooks side by side</strong>.</p>

<p>At $549, the Dell packs a fair bit of notebook computer value and when you consider the fact a MacBook Pro 15 inch is $2000 or more –  a $500 notebook looks pretty good in 201.  The main features of the Dell Inspiron 15R  include the switch lids I mentioned above, but also is enabled for Widi and 3DTV that allows you to wirelessly project  your movies to your HDTV. You can buy the  Dell Inspiron 15R with 2nd generation Intel Core i7 processors, <strong>more RAM</strong>, bigger hard drives and add printers, monitors and other to your shopping cart, but at  $549 you’ll limited to an Intel Core i3 processor, <strong>4GB of DDR3 1333Mhz RAM</strong> which is actually a very usable RAM amount  and  for every day home use and web browsing like facebook, etc, it’s quite possible you won’t need to upgrade the RAM on the Dell Inspiron 15R.</p>

<p>But, I recommend two things: That you do buy more dell memory and you don’t buy  the RAM from Dell as it’s priced too much. 4GB DDR3 memory of which you’ll need two of to max out the RAM on a Dell 15R 2nd generation will set you back over $200 or more, where alternately you can <strong><a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT2KIT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1339">buy the maximum RAM of 8GB for well under $100</a></strong> and save closer to $200 on Dell memory uprades, all by taking 5 minutes to  shop around for the best prices on RAM Upgrades from memory vendors you can trust and are reputable, as that’s the only kind of RAM and  memory I recommend.</p>

<p>All this advice only applies to saving money on RAM upgrades on the Dell Inspiron 2nd generation 15R (which looks like a great deal on a windows 7 notebook) and if you’ve got deep pockets or don’t have the time to install the ram yourself (it’s easy to do a memory upgrade  on most any Dell computer – just pop the battery out, and there’s a cover on the bottom of the notebook you remove to acesss the two memory upgrade slots available) then you may  be better off just configuring the RAM when you buy the Inspiron online from Dell, but for those of us that want to save money on Dell Memory Upgrades, regardless s of specific model number.</p>

<p>To upgrade the RAM on Dell Inspiron 15R 2nd generation you’ll need to <strong><a href="http://www.dpbolvw.net/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT51264BC1339">buy two 4GB DDR3 1333mhz sodimms</a></strong>, usually sold in <strong><a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT2KIT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1339">8GB notebook memory upgrade kits</a></strong> that make it easy to upgrade the two slots available for upgrade on this affordable Dell designed for every day home and small office use.</p>

<p>**Dell Inspiron 15R 2nd Generation Deals and Best Prices **</p>

<p>Your best bet for a <strong>deal on a dell notebook</strong> is to buy it <a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10639500">directly from Dell</a> where you can configure your dell laptop with added software such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0050PJB32/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B0050PJB32">Microsoft Home and Office</a>, faster processors, bigger hard drives and even add extra switchable lids if that’s your thing, but I also recommend you check out Amazon for the <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fbestsellers%2Felectronics%2F565108%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref_%3Dzg_bs_nav%23&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">best notebook computer deals</a></strong> as well.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2011/05/how-much-ram-do-i-need-for-a-laptop/">How Much RAM Do I Need For A Laptop?</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>The short answer to how much memory you need – regardless of computer manufacturer – Mac or PC, is you <strong>need as much memory as possible</strong></p>

<p>There’s a good chance that you need to upgrade the laptop you’re using to read this with, as out of the box and direct from the factory, unless you bought a CTO (configured to order) PC that you chose to fill your laptop with, there’s a good chance the RAM you have installed is just enough to RUN the operating systems and not much else.</p>

<p>Apple Mac OS Snow Leopards Minimum RAM Requirements are 1GB, and 5GB of hard drive space, yet that is JUST for the operating system to RUN, and not much else, including the iApps such as iTunes, iPhoto and the like. And if you need to run Aperture or any processor intensive application that uses memory then the minimum recommended ram of 1GB for MacOS</p>

<p>On the Windows side of things, you’ll need even more memory. 1GB will do you for running 32 bit Windows 7, but if you need 64 bit Microsoft Windows for your laptop OS then 2GB is the minimum RAM you should have installed</p>

<p>As you can see, 1GB or even 2GB really isn’t a whole lot of RAM if you want to do anything with your computer than start it up. (try installing windows 7 or even Mac OS on a 1GB laptop and you’ll see what I mean)</p>

<p>In 2011, the minimum RAM I would recommend for every day computing is 4GB. 8GB is better if your notebook computer can accomodate the larger memory size, but if you’re looking to buy and upgrade a notebook computer in 2011 you’re best to max out your laptop to 8GB if you can.</p>

<p>**Best RAM Prices for Laptops.<br />
**</p>

<p>There’s a very good chance your laptop takes DDR3 1333Mhz memory upgrades and below is a table of the best notebook prices I have found on sale from memory stores you can trust that are much much cheaper than if you bought the memory from the PC manufacturers directly.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">Not much at all. </a></p>

<p>You can double the RAM in your MBP to 4GB very easily and cheaply just by adding more memory. You’ll  need to buy new ram upgrades and replace the ram  in your MacBook Pro – currently 2x1GB MacBook Pro RAM  with larger 2×2 GB RAM for MacBook Pros but the cost is negligible, especially if you are making your living with your MacBook Pro adding another 2gb of RAM will be like breathing a breath of fresh air into now what will be a discontinued MacBook Pro, as the current MBP’s take 8GB of DDR3 SDRAM.</p>

<p>I don’t know what specific model of MacBook Pro you’re looking to ugprade, but you should  be able to do so for not  much money at all. MacBook Pro models that accept 4GB are now, in 2011 a few years old and you could be looking to squeeze more life out of a 2009, 2010 or even 2008 MacBook Pro notebook, as these all max out with 4GB of memory.</p>

<p>You’ll be in the market for DDR3 1066 SDRAM dimms and a s you can see by the MacBook Pro RAM Price chart below RAM for MacBooks is cheaper than it has ever been before and  continues to drop in price over time, so if you want, you can wait until ram prices fall even further. But the disadvantage of this approach is that your’e sacrificing your time over money when the benefit of the ram will far outweigh the costs of a 4GB RAM upgrade for a MacBook Pro.</p>

<p>The HP DV6 notebook computer lineup comes in many different models and configurations  and has been a popular notebook computer from HP for some time, but I want to concentrate today on the newest and latest HP DV6 series notebooks as these are one of the best selling HP notebooks available today and run either i3, i5, or i7 Intel Core processors and when it comes to ram for the 2011 HP DV6 notebook lineup your best deal and correct RAM to buy is DDR3 1066MHz sdram sodimms.</p>

<p>Out of the box, whether you buy a HP DV6 series notebook from Best Buy, or  Amazon or even from HP directly this notebook comes shipped from the factory various with standard memory configurations depending on processor speed and model number, but  the maximum RAM for the HP DV6 notebooks stays the same at 8GB and unless you buy your HP completely configured with the maximum ram already installed that while is probably the easiest way to upgrade ram on this HP notebook, it’s far from the cheapest and you’re much better off  buying HP DV6 memory from a trusted memory store that guarantees the RAM to work just fine in your HP notebook, but for far less money than what you could expect to spend  on a HP memory upgrade.</p>

<p>[table id=8 /]</p>

<p>As you can see from above, the  prices above for HP DV6 ram and memory upgrades are quite reasonable with  an 8GB ram upgrade costing today less than $100 which is the maximum memory allowed on this notebook computer using two available memory upgrade slots.</p>

<p>To maximize the memory on your HP DV6 notebook  you will need to replace the memory currently installed  in your HP notebook and replace the memory upgrade modules with larger memory upgrade modules (<a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-1548159-10273954?url=http://www.crucial.com/store/affiliateredirect.asp?imodule=CT2KIT51264BC1067&amp;aid=1027395&amp;cid=777292&amp;subid=89&amp;PRS&amp;uscj&amp;cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1067">currently 8GB memory</a>), and after doing so, you will enjoy one of the fastest HP notebooks priced well under $700, just by adding more memory to your HP DV6 series notebook computer by HP.</p>

<p>I, at close to 15 years doing this – writing and tracking ram prices and memory upgrades from reputable ram vendors – I have come to realize one thing, and that’s ram gets cheaper and the standard or maximum ram size gets bigger.</p>

<p>It doesn’t seem too long ago, that a big deal with a memory upgrade was 256mb. Now that small amount of memory isn’t even an option for computers in 2011 regardless or make or manufacturer and as the years go by and the OS’s – both Mac and PC – get more and more bloated with prettier buttons and fancier features you can be sure of one thing, and that’s that all this stuff requires more RAM or memory.</p>

<p><strong>How Much Memory is Enough?</strong></p>

<p>In 2011, if you are going to make the effort and expense to upgrade the ram on your Mac or PC, I would start at 8GB, and if you have a modern computer (ie: Intel Core i3, i5, i7) then you will have no problem with adding 8GB of RAM to most modern computers today, especially for desktop computers.</p>

<p>Notebook computers on the other hand due mostly to the fact that there’s not a whole lot of space to put a memory ugprade, are a bit trickier to upgrade the RAM on, but again – 8GB RAM maximums are common on most notebook PC’s built today and although still pricey – costing as much as the notebook computer the memory is being installed in – 16GB RAM will be the defacto memory upgrade as the components for 16gb memory get cheaper over time. It wasn’t that long ago that installing 8gb of RAM in a notebook computer would cost you well over one thousand dollars, but now you can buy 8GB of notebook RAM for under $100.</p>

<p>You might be very happy running your computer with the RAM that it came from the factory and if all your computing needs happen in a web browser. (mine do) than the default 3GB or 4GB your notebook came with could very well be enough memory for facebook and the like.</p>

<p>But,if you make a living with your computer (I do, again) then 8GB is where I’d go when it comes to ram upgrades in 2011. With RAM so cheap (see ram price list below), especially for notebook computers and if you make a living with it, or just a serious hobbyist then 8GB ram upgrades from an array of memory stores are available for purchase, and all at significant savings when you compare the ram prices demanded by the computer manufacturers</p>

<p>Adding 8GB  of iMac RAM to a 4GB iMac depends on what specific Apple iMac you are looking at upgrading and even when it is possible, I don’t suggest it as it’s my thought that considering how cheap iMac RAM is these days, you’d be better off doing one of two upgrades:</p>

<p>For iMacs that can only accept 8GB as maximum memory and assuming your iMac ships from the factory with 4GB filling the memory slots (we’re going to assume your iMac only has two memory upgrade slots which was the case with older iMac released prior to summer 2010) you’ll have to replace the 2x2GB memory upgrades with 2x4GB memory modules to hit 8GB</p>

<p>But if you can hit 16GB on your iMac I suggest you maximize the RAM on your newer iMac (summer 2010 and  later) with the maximum memory allowed which at time of writing is 16GB of iMac RAM.</p>

<p>Adding 8GB of iMac RAM to 4GB, while in some iMac configurations is possible, doesn’t make a bunch of sense to me when for under $200 you can completely fill your iMac with the most ram it can handle.</p>

<p>For additional savings on your iMac RAM purchase you can even sell back the iMac RAM you had from the factory for even more savings off your $200 Apple iMac  RAM upgrade total price.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/OWC">OWC </a>will buy back your RAM and at the time I write this will pay you $27 for your 4GB of RAM on 2010 and 2011 Apple iMac models, that if you apply to the total cost of your new iMac 16GB upgrade (two 8GB ddr3 memory upgrade kits are required) you could have your new iMac filled with RAM for a touch over $150.00, (plus taxes, and shipping fees)</p>

<p>And speaking of fees for shipping, most online vendors offer free shipping on this much memory for iMacs, not to mention the out of state tax savings you could be eligible for as well in some cases.</p>

<p>So to answer your question: Yes you can add 8GB of iMac RAM but you’re better off either saving more money on RAM and only adding an additional 4GB or go all out and fill your iMac with as much RAM as possible, which is 16GB of iMac RAM</p>

<p>Here’s the current best and lowest RAM prices for iMac to help you decide on what size memory upgrade to get for your iMac</p>

<p>The Apple MacBook Pro 2.66, while now in 2011 is a discontinued Apple computer model, it’s still a bargain to <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com">upgrade the RAM </a>on this powerful notebook from  Apple with a 2.66GHz Intel Core i7 and I’m not the only one that thinks this, as this particular memory upgrade is one of the best selling ram upgrades you can buy today.</p>

<p><strong>RAM Specifications for Apple MacBook Pro 2.66</strong></p>

<p>The Apple MacBook Pro 2.66 17 inch notebook shipped from Apple  with just 4GB of RAM installed at the factory, but you can easily double the RAM on this notebook computer by buying 2x4GB memory modules, or  if you prefer an 8GB  memory upgrade kit  for MacBook Pro to max out the memory on this specific MacBook Pro Model using the two upgrade slots available in the MacBook Pro. You do have to replace the factory installed 2x2GB ram modules with the larger 4GB memory upgrades as there’s very little room inside a MacBook Pro  as apposed to a desktop system that allows for more ram capacity and memory configuration choices.</p>

<p>**How to Install MacBook Pro 2.66 GHz Intel Core i7 RAM **</p>

<p>It’s really easy to install the memory yourself on the MacBook Pro 2.66Ghz and if you buy quality ram and take your time on the ram install and guard against static electricity the result will be a faster MacBook Pro than before, which is one of the reasons for a memory upgrade in the first place.</p>

<p>Apple will even provide you with <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1270">handy instructions</a> on how to perform the upgrade of your MacBook Pro 2.66Ghz step by step and althogh this may not apply anymore, depending on whether you bought AppleCare for your 2010 MacBook Pro will not void your warranty either.</p>

<p>It’s really a  simple  upgrade and memory prices haven’t been cheaper ever, so now’s the time to <strong><a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-1548159-10273954?url=http://www.crucial.com/store/affiliateredirect.asp?imodule=CT2KIT51264BC1067&amp;aid=1027395&amp;cid=777292&amp;subid=89&amp;PRS&amp;uscj&amp;cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1067">max out the ram on your MacBook Pro 2.66 Ghz </a></strong>to 8GB and enjoy a faster and smoother running MacBook Pro 2.66Ghz as a result.</p>

<p><strong>Apple MacBook Pro 17 inch RAM Prices</strong></p>

<p>[table id=1 /]</p>

<p>I have already written about the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/upgrade-macbook-to-8gb-ram/" title="Upgrade MacBook To 8GB RAM">benefits of maxing out the RAM on your MacBook Pro to 8GB</a>, or<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/apple-macintosh-memory-16gb-macbook-pro-ram/" title="16GB MacBook Pro RAM"> even 16GB if you can afford it</a> for the cheaper MacBook Pro models” <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/apple-macbook-pro-13-inch-2-3ghz-memory-upgrade-prices/" title="Apple MacBook Pro 13 inch 2.3GHz Memory Upgrade Prices">13 inch 2.3GHz</a>,<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/apple-macbook-pro-13-inch-2-7ghz-ram-upgrade-options-and-prices/" title="Apple MacBook Pro 13 inch 2.7GHz RAM Upgrade Options and Prices"> 13 inch 2.7 Ghz</a>, <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/apple-macbook-pro-15-inch-2-0ghz-memory-and-ram-upgrade-choices/" title="Apple MacBook Pro 15 inch 2.0GHz Memory and RAM Upgrade Choices">15 inch 2.0 GHz</a> and <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/apple-macbook-pro-15-inch-2-2-ghz-memory-upgrades/" title="Apple MacBook Pro 15 inch 2.2 GHz Memory Upgrades">15 inch 2.2 GHz</a> and ho**w buying and adding more RAM for the MacBook Pro **is the best deal when considering any Apple upgrade – even before  software or more storage space, like <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/best-ssd-hard-drives-for-2011/" title="Best SSD Hard Drives for 2011">SSD hard drives</a> that offer even faster storage and data retrieval but the price to performance ratio still leans heavy towards price for solid state drives in 2011 and so far this year you are best to spend your money on RAM unless you have the ultimate need for speed or deep pockets.</p>

<p>Buying <a href="http://store.apple.com">RAM from Apple direct</a> is probably the easiest way to <strong>max out the RAM on the new MacBook Pro 17 inch 2.2 GHz</strong>, but do you see the price for MacBook Pro RAM from the Apple Store? It’s kindof pricey when you compare ram prices from other trusted memory manufacturers like Crucial who offers much more competitive prices and as I write this you can <strong><a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT2KIT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1339">max out your MBP 17 RAM for under $100 </a></strong>which is a savings of over $300 on your RAM upgrade – enough for you to buy that faster SSD drive at the same time as your ram order, rather than pay what in my opinion is too much for MacBook Pro RAM from Apple directly.</p>

<p>**MacBook Pro 17 inch RAM Upgrades Are Easy. **</p>

<p>If you pay a bit of attention to what you’re doing and use some precaution when it comes to static electricity, your RAM upgrade can be done by yourself, and all you have to do is <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com">buy the memory</a>, remove the old factory installed memory modules and replace them with the larger sized memory modules you bought to replace them with. Simple as pie, and your MacBook Pro 17 inch will run much faster when you <strong>double or even quadruple the memory</strong> upgrade in it.</p>

<p>The best part about uprading MacBook Book Pro RAM itself on the MacBook Pros is that Apple even <strong><a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1270">provide instructions</a></strong> on how to do so. Step by step, you’re led through the memory upgrade process where you can upgrade the memory all by yourself without having to take the MacBook Pro into a service center or store such as Best Buy to have the RAM installed.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MX5YWI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399349&amp;creativeASIN=B001MX5YWI"><img title="MacBook Pro sodimm memory" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51pi-7HjvPL._SL500_AA300_.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a></p>

<p>*8GB Apple MacBook Pro Memory Upgrade Kit is above. note the slot in the sodimm – you can’t screw up the memory install if you take your time. *</p>

<p>The RAM on the MacBook Pro is 1333MHz and in a 240 pin sodimm memory module with a little slot in the chip so you cannot install the memory backwards or upside down. On the MacBook Pro, there’s two memory upgrade slots to upgrade the RAM, but unlike Apple desktops like the iMac, there’s not a whole lot of room inside the MacBook Pro so you need to remove or replace the factory RAM (which you can sell) and replace it with the larger memory modules you have bought.</p>

<p>Why Apple doesn’t fill the 17 inch MacBook Pro with at least 8GB is beyond  me, especially considering this MacBook Pro is not a <strong>cheap netbook computer</strong> but priced over two thousand dollars you’d think that they could bump the RAM to 8GB, which as the year progresses is becoming the standard memory configuration when it comes to average ram needed for computing in 2011, and especially considering this MacBook Pro model is aimed a professional users who will be running applications like Photoshop and Final Cut Pro that will happily take all the memory you can throw at them.</p>

<p>So. If you’re either buying a MacBook Pro or already own one, do yourself a big favor and spend less than $100 on a MacBook Pro RAM Upgrade and enjoy the biggest and fastest Apple notebook in 2011 by <strong><a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT2KIT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1339">doubling the memory upgrades on your 17 inch 2.2 GHz Apple MacBook Pro.</a></strong></p>

<p>The <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/fastest-ram-for-macbook-pro-2010/" title="Fastest RAM for MacBook Pro 2010 and 2011">fastest Apple MacBook Pro</a></strong>, the 2011 15 inch 2.2 Ghz model that features a 2.2. Ghz Intel Core i7 processor can be made to go even faster for under $100  (see the chart above for current MacBook Pro RAM Prices)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/macbook-pro-ddr3-1333mhz-memory-upgrade-prices/" title="macbook pro ram prices">RAM for the new MacBook Pros</a> –  and this  includes the MacBook Pro <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/apple-macbook-pro-13-inch-2-3ghz-memory-upgrade-prices/" title="Apple MacBook Pro 13 inch 2.3GHz Memory Upgrade Prices">13 inch 2.3</a>, <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/apple-macbook-pro-13-inch-2-7ghz-ram-upgrade-options-and-prices/" title="Apple MacBook Pro 13 inch 2.7GHz RAM Upgrade Options and Prices">13 inch 2.7 </a>and <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/apple-macbook-pro-15-inch-2-0ghz-memory-and-ram-upgrade-choices/" title="Apple MacBook Pro 15 inch 2.0GHz Memory and RAM Upgrade Choices">15 inch 2.0</a> models I have already written about differ from the 2010 MacBook Pros when it comes to memory upgrades and to answer a question I get asked daily: <strong>no you cannot take the ram from your 2010 MacBook Pro or vice versa</strong> as each MacBook Pro uses a different memory upgrade speed and specifications for the two MacBook Pro model years are different. In the case of the 2010 Apple MacBook Pro, all <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/best-prices-for-notebook-memory-ddr-3-1066mhz-204-pin-sodimms/" title="Best Prices for Notebook Memory: DDR 3 1066Mhz 204 Pin SODIMMS">2010 MacBook Pros require 1066 SDRAM sodimms</a> while the latest and newest MacBook Pros run <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/best-prices-for-notebook-memory-ddr3-1333mhz-204-pin-sodimms/" title="Best Prices for Notebook Memory: DDR3 1333Mhz 204 Pin SODIMMS">1333MHz DDR3 RAM</a> that is completely different from the ram the older MacBook Pros take.</p>

<p>While it’s true there are bigger and faster MacBook Pros and even <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/best-notebook-computers-of-2011/" title="Best NoteBook Computers of 2011">best selling notebooks</a> such as the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/macbook-pro-13-3-inch-8gb-memory-upgrades/" title="MacBook Pro 13.3 inch 8GB Memory Upgrades">13 inch MacBook Pro</a> which seems to be a hit due to the perfect balance of notebook display size and price performance, this <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0017HSZWK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399349&amp;creativeASIN=B0017HSZWK">15 inch 2.2GHz MBP</a></strong> offers the fastest MacBook Pro to date in 2011 (a referesh again later in the year? It’s anybody’s guess  maybe in the fall just in time to buy a MacBook Pro for Christmas) Without having to go to the next size up; the <strong>17 inch Apple MacBook Pro</strong> that does offer even faster performance and comes at a bigger size , where portability and light weight are a concern and you still need as much screen real estate as you possibly can  the 15 inch MacBook Pro 2.2 Ghz might be considered the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/best-2011-notebook-computer-brands/" title="Best 2011 Notebook Computer Brands"><strong>best MacBook Pro deal today</strong> </a>for those wanting to buy a fast Apple notebook.</p>

<p>And sadly as  I made note above: You can’t take your old ram with you (<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/where-can-i-sell-old-ram/" title="Where Can I Sell Old RAM?">you could sell it though</a>) so to get the most out of a computer that’s not cheap by any means you really should<strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com"> buy more ram</a></strong> and max out the memory on your MacBook Pro 2.2Ghz RAM.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>Apple Store RAM Prices for MacBook Pro 15 inch 2.2Ghz i7</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://store.apple.com" title="Apple Store">Apple Store</a> offers a lot of things including <strong>best selling ipads, ipods</strong> and the like, and they’ve even been know to make some of the best notebook computers available but if there’s one thing that’s been pretty consistent it’s this: Apple RAM is expensive. Especially when you <strong>compare ram prices from Apple to other third party memory products</strong> I track and monitor where you could buy essentially the same memory upgrade for Apple for about <strong>25% of the cost of  memory from the Apple Store.</strong></p>

<p>Now,  if you tend to have either deep pockets, or perhaps buying cheaper RAM for 15 inch MBP’s is not your concern then go ahead and buy Apple RAM. It won’t be the cheapest RAM you can buy but you do get the advantage of your memory upgrades all shipping from the same company and if you buy the MacBook Pro 15 inch 2.2 GHz  at the same time as your RAM, Apple will ship your RAM already installed so when you take your brand new 2011 Apple MacBook out of the box you won’t have to worry about RAM upgrades at all.</p>

<p><strong>20 11 15 inch 2.2 Ghz Memory Upgrade Instructions</strong></p>

<p>Apple might not be the wisest choice when it comes to saving money on memory upgrades but they do offer fantastic instructions on <strong>how to upgrade MacBook Pro 2.2 GHz RAM</strong>. It might be common knowledge to some of you I’m sure but a lot of folks don’t know that a memory upgrade is the best computing dollar you can spend and that it’s easy to do and will not void  your warranty. In fact, Apple even shows you<a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1270#link3" title="how to upgrade macbook memory"> how to upgrade 15 inch MacBook RAM</a> with easy to follow instructions.</p>

<p>Out of the box, the Apple MacBook Pro 2.2 Ghz 15 inch ships with just<strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/how-much-memory-will-a-macbook-pro-recognize/" title="How Much Memory Will A MacBook Pro Recognize?"> 4GB of RAM</a></strong> as  standard but when you carefully follow the instructions above, you can double your memory to 8GB MacBook Pro Memory for much less than just a few months ago, or if you go against the maximum RAM suggested by Apple some stores will sell you <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/apple-macintosh-memory-16gb-macbook-pro-ram/" title="16GB MacBook Pro RAM">MacBook Pro 16GB RAM upgrades</a></strong>.  I’m always hesitant to suggest y0u upgrade to more than the maximum Apple suggests even though for most instances, the maximum memory specified by Apple is due to the fact that bigger ram chips were not available at the release date so the maximum memory allowed is simply due to that fact alone, but if I had a brand new Apple computer that cost over $2000 I can tell you I would be reluctant to install more RAM than what Apple states is the allowed maximum.</p>

<p><a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1270#link3" title="detailed memory upgrade instructions">Detailed memory upgrade instructions</a> are included in the link above, but the latest Apple MacBook Pro 15 inch models are pretty <strong>easy to upgrade the memory</strong> on: You remove the bottom, and the RAM upgrades are looking at you without any further computer dismantling, allowing you easy access to the 2 memory upgrade slots where you will have to remove the RAM installed by the factory (Apple) and replace it with your new larger <strong><a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT2KIT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1339">2x 4GB memory modules for the 8GB maximum</a></strong> MacBook Pro RAM as per Apple, or 16GB if you need the most RAM you can possibly fit  into your MacBook Pro.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>A ram upgrade is the <strong>best computer upgrade you can do for any computer</strong> and it’s the very first thing I do when I pull a new Mac out of the box. ( not that this is an every day thing, I’m writing this on a 2008 MacBook Pro).  Software, or even hard drives, like a <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/best-ssd-hard-drives-for-2011/" title="Best SSD Hard Drives for 2011">new SSD hard drive</a></strong> which would come in as a close second upgrade I would perform on this MacBook Pro but memory is most important and now in 2011, cheap. RAM for MacBook Pros regardless of size has never been cheaper than it is today.  The best value for a ram upgrade is a 8GB MacBook  Pro memory upgrade kit, as the 16GB ram uprades are still too pricey for all but those needing to be on the bleeding edge of technology. The 8GB option still doubles your MacBook Pro RAM yet is affordable unlike the  16GB.  Wait  a bit for the 16GB to drop in price (it’s dropped $100 in price in the past week) to a more realistic and affordable memory upgrade choice for the MacBook Pro 2.2 inch</p>
