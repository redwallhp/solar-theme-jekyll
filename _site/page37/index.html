<p>**13 inch 2.3 GHz  Apple MacBook Pro RAM Upgrade Prices<br />
**</p>

<p>The newest Apple MacBook Pro and also the <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/buying-a-macbook-pro-whats-the-best/" title="Buying a MacBook Pro: What’s the Best?">cheapest MacBook Pro</a></strong> Apple has released this year could benefit from a memory upgrade, despite the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26x%3D0%26ref_%3Dnb_sb_noss%26y%3D0%26field-keywords%3Dmacbook%2520pro%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">cheap price the smallest MacBook Pro is available for</a>. Out of the box, the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/2011-apple-macbook-pros-announced/" title="2011 Apple MacBook Pros Announced">Apple MacBook Pro 13 inch 2.3GHz model</a> comes with a fast dual core Intel core i5 processor 4GB of DDR3 1333Mhz memory installed as factory default when it comes to MacBook Pro RAM configuration, that, while enough for running the operating system and some i Apps, such as iLife, iPhoto, and iMovie – <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/cost-of-4gb-ram-memory-for-macbook-pro/" title="Cost of 4GB RAM Memory for MacBook Pro">4GB of MacBook Pro RAM </a>in 2011, really isn’t that much memory and you really should <strong>upgrade the 13 inch MacBook Pro 2.3 Ghz model to double the installed memory</strong> – if not more, if your budget will allow</p>

<p>With 16 GB MacBook Pro RAM now readily available <em>(but still pricey – 16GB MacBook Pro memory costs as much as the MacBook you’re installing into the 16GB ram option for MacBook Pro, this is still not really a viable option for most of us looking for a good deal on MacBook Pro memory for the new 13 inch MacBook Pro)</em></p>

<p>The <strong>8GB 13 inch MacBook Pro memory upgrade option</strong>, with street prices of under $100 is a much more affordable and possible memory upgrade when it comes to RAM in the Apple MacBook Pro models.</p>

<p>**MacBook Pro Memory Upgrade Trade In Options<br />
**</p>

<p>What makes a <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/cost-of-memory-for-2011-apple-macbook-pro/" title="Cost of Memory for 2011 Apple MacBook Pro">deal on MacBook Pro memory</a> even better is that you can sell, or trade in your factory installed RAM from your 13 inch MacBook Pro and get even a better deal on MacBook Pro RAM than the 13 inch MacBook Pro RAM Prices I list above when you buy RAM from <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/oempcworld">OEMPCWORLD</a>, <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/ramjet">RAMJET</a> and <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/OWC">OWC</a> – just three Mac Memory stores that will happily take your Apple factory RAM as trade, <strong>saving you even more money on MacBook Pro RAM</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>13 inch 2.3 GHz Memory Upgrade Options</strong></p>

<p>Out of the box, the Apple 13 inch MBP running at 2.3 GHz, ships with <strong>4GB of RAM installed</strong> in the two memory upgrade slots the 13 inch MacBook Pro offers for upgrade so the only viable memory upgrade choices will be either 8GB or 16GB, and as you can see from the memory prices above it still costs a pretty penny to make 16GB MacBook Pro ram upgrades happen.</p>

<p>This leaves the <strong>8GB MacBook Pro Memory Upgrade Kit</strong> as your best bet for memory upgrades on the new 13 inch 2011 MacBook Pro model, and a number of memory stores offer these RAM upgrades for under $100, which a much more realistic price for a memory upgrade for any laptop computer – not just Apple MacBook Pro’s.</p>

<p>**How To Upgrade RAM on 13 inch MacBook Pro 2.3Hz<br />
**</p>

<p>Once you’ve decided on what MacBook Pro RAM to buy (and I leave that part up to you, some might want to save the most money you can on MacBook Pro RAM others prefer to buy name brand RAM) you can easily install the RAM on 13 inch MBP’s, or any MacBook Pro model that requires 1333Mhz sodimms for memory upgrades yourself, saving you even more money, as you don’t need to take in your MacBook Pro to the Apple Store or any other Authorized Dealer who will charge you for installing RAM.</p>

<p>The memory upgrade slots on the 13 inch MacBook Pros are easily accessible and with some safety precautions and a bit of common sense you can remove the MacBook Pro factory RAM, install newer, larger MacBook Pro memory modules and be rewarded with a faster, smoother running Apple notebook computer that can open more applications at the same time. Apple even shows you <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1270#link1">how to upgrade 2011 MacBook Pro RAM</a> all by yourself.</p>

<p>Essentially, all you have to do to replace or upgrade the RAM on the 13 inch 2.3 Ghz MacBook Pro is the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Remove the bottom case of the 13 inch MacBook Pro. There’s ten screws holding down the bottom cover that you need to remove and remember not to loose any of the screws, as you will need to re-install those ten screws when the ram upgrade is complete</li>
  <li>Discharge any static electricity you may have on you. RAM and static electricity  don’t mix. You may even want to buy an anti-static wrist strap for  a few dollars to be extra safe.</li>
  <li>Remove the factory RAM. There’s two little tabs, or wings that you spread apart to allow the MacBook Pro RAM to be removed. The RAM then pops up so you can grab it and pull it gently from the memory upgrade  slot.  First do this for the top memory slot and then again for the bottom memory slot.</li>
</ol>

<p>Then you just do the reverse to install the MacBook Pro memory upgrades with larger 4GB memory upgrade modules. The 1333Mhz sodimms only go in the MacBook Pro one way  thanks to a slot in the module yourself, so  you really can’t screw this up – line up the slot with the memory upgrade slot on the Macbook Pro and push until the ram upgrade is seated, and then click the MacBook Pro RAM back in so the little plastic tabs or wings lock it in place.</p>

<p>Replace the cover with with those ten screws you put away carefully, turn over your MacBook Pro and power it up and you’ll rewarded with a MacBook Pro with double the memory upgrades that Apple  installed at the factory, and you get to experience the full power hidden inside your 13 inch MacBook Pro 2.3HGhz</p>

<p>The Apple MacBook Pro 13 inch is the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26scn%3D565108%26redirect%3Dtrue%26ref_%3Dsr_nr_scat_565108_ln%26keywords%3Dwindows%2520pc%26qid%3D1302792487%26h%3Dc7bb7aa435747f968b60d8f3daa0430828b78469%26rh%3Dn%253A565108%252Ck%253Awindows%2520pc&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">best selling notebook today</a></p>

<p>You know, as we enter 2011 I’m beginning to wonder the same thing as for what I do here on ramseeker – <strong>could  my MacBook could easily be replaced by a much cheaper windows PC?</strong> I’ve had a notebook PC for a few years now where it’s served as an underused and underappreciated iTunes music server, but as recent as just last evening I began to wonder if I could do what I do on a much cheaper windows PC instead?</p>

<p>The  13 inch MacBook Pro is the <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26scn%3D565108%26redirect%3Dtrue%26ref_%3Dsr_nr_scat_565108_ln%26keywords%3Dwindows%2520pc%26qid%3D1302792487%26h%3Dc7bb7aa435747f968b60d8f3daa0430828b78469%26rh%3Dn%253A565108%252Ck%253Awindows%2520pc&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">newest and most popular notebook on sale</a></strong> today, so there’s lots and lots of Apple fans that would much rather pay for the Apple brand  and there are a few reasons why in the long term the <strong>Apple Mac might be the better buy</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>The Mac Operating System</strong></p>

<p>The Mac/PC ads that were so popular both on TV and online a few years back featuring Justin Lon and John Hodgman highlighted the advantages of the Apple software, and  when it comes to innovation I think Apple gets the nod. Apple tends to lead the way with newer technology than Windows. The Mac OS tends to be, admittedly from a Mac-centric perspective, more intuitive.</p>

<p><strong>More Built in Software</strong></p>

<p>Or maybe better designed built in software might be a better way to state this. The included apps such as iLife, Garage Band, iMovie and the like tend to get better over the years and are also upgraded every year. There’s also iTunes which is software not for downloading  and playing music but Apple computers tend to work seamlessly with other Apple products such as iPods and iPhones.</p>

<p><strong>The Mac is Virus Free</strong></p>

<p>Somebody’s  going to chime in on this I know, but I’ve never been wiped out by viruses in the many many years I have owned and loved Apple computers. This may be the deal breaker right here, as with Windows you have to add and renew expensive antivirus software programs to be virus free. My Apple Macs have always just worked from the day I took them out of the box to the days I have sold or upgraded my Macs. When it comes to Macs they just worked for me.</p>

<p>I guess it all comes down to  what you do and how important your computing needs are. If all you do is facebook and email, then any old windows PC and most smartphones today are up  to the task. With the Macs, you pay more up front  – as much as triple the costs of a windows PC,  but it’s my opinion you get a better built and thought out product that’s more intuitive to use. But the downside of this is you’ll pay for it up front, and if you don’t have the cash then perhaps you should consider <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26scn%3D565108%26redirect%3Dtrue%26ref_%3Dsr_nr_scat_565108_ln%26keywords%3Dwindows%2520pc%26qid%3D1302792487%26h%3Dc7bb7aa435747f968b60d8f3daa0430828b78469%26rh%3Dn%253A565108%252Ck%253Awindows%2520pc&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">buying a windows PC</a></strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Your Mac Will Tell You What Memory You Need.</strong></p>

<p>But, all joking aside it’s pretty easy to figure out what memory you need for your 2010 MacBook Pro (or any Apple computer, now that I think of it).You could always <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/contact">ask me</a>. <img src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p>In the top left corner of your Apple MacBook 2010 is a little Apple logo, that if you click it you will see a menu item called <strong>About This Mac</strong>. It’s the very first menu item you see when you select the Apple Menu, so it’s pretty easy to find. After you have selected the menu, up pops a window that looks similar to this:<br />
<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1713" title="Apple Menu " src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Screen-shot-2011-04-14-at-3.08.10-PM.png" alt="How to Find Mac Memory" width="311" height="385" /></a></p>

<p>On this menu, you will see that it will tell you what version of the Mac OS you are running,  what your processor speed is and how much and what type of speed memory you have already installed in your MacBook Pro. In my  case, I already have the maximum macbook memory installed as I’m typing this on  a 2008 MacBook Pro, and at the time, 4GB of RAM was a lot of memory (how times change)</p>

<p>The more info button will bring up the system profiler which will tell you that you’ve got two memory upgade chips installed and some other technical jargon that, in my opinion you don’t need – as you now have all the data you need – you know your MacBook Pro processor speed, memory type and speed and how much ram you already have installed.</p>

<p>Now all you need is to find a memory store that will help you find the right ram for your MacBook Pro. I’ve got a <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/where-to-buy-computer-memory-upgrades/" title="memory store list">great list of memory stores</a> here but for this example I will use <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">crucial technology</a></strong> as they offer fair prices on ram and  have an easy to use memory upgrade finder.</p>

<p>Off we go to <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">Crucial</a></strong>, where we select our Computer Manufacturer, Model Name, and processor speed  – all things your Mac already told you you have, and  you’re returned with information about your particular model such as memory type for your MacBook Pro (which we already know) and how many slots  and the maximum RAM your MacBook Pro can recognize, stuff we didn’t know.</p>

<p>If my MacBook Pro only had 2GB of RAM installed, I now know that I could max out my RAM on my MacBook Pro by replacing the 2x1GB memory upgrades with bigger memory modules, and  in this example that would be two 2GB memory modules for MacBook Pro which would maximize the RAM in my particular Apple MacBook Pro.</p>

<p>And once you have bought your MacBook Pro RAM Upgrade, it’s easy to install the MacBook memory yourself with common household tools that will not void your warranty. You can find how to upgrade your Apple RAM from Apple as <strong><a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1270" title="how to install apple ram">Macbook Pro Memory Upgrade instructions</a></strong> are included in the manual that came with your MacBook Pro.</p>

<p>It’s that easy to find the right memory for your MacBook Pro.</p>

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>I tend to pay more attention to the 2010 Apple iMacs, as that’s where you will get the most bang for your buck as the older iMacs might be so low in value that it’s not worth it to add more RAM to your iMac and you might be better off just selling your old iMac on eBay or Craigslist and buying a new iMac altogether if the memory upgrades end up costing you more than your Apple iMac is worth, it might be something to consider.</p>

<p><strong>Which iMac Do You Need To Buy Memory For?</strong>Where to buy iMac memory depends on many variables including whether you value the best price on ram you can get, or maybe you don’t mind paying more for iMac RAM and are willing to spend more on name brand ram, such as Crucial or Kingston RAM. But whatever you decide – cheap RAM for iMac, or the more pricier stuff – there’s one thing you have to determine first and that is:</p>

<p><strong>How To Tell What Apple iMac RAM You Need To Buy</strong></p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW">Best iMac RAM on Sale</a></strong></p>

<p>There’s many ways to do this and some <a href="http://www.memoryseller.com">memory sellers</a> even offer a small application you can download that will help you find the right iMac Memory you need, or if you know the speed of the computer you need to upgrade you may have enough info to use the memory configurator the ram stores offer.</p>

<p>One way to determine what RAM you need to buy for any Mac, and not just Apple iMacs is to use the good old Apple Menu to tell you: In the top left corner of your Mac is About This Mac, and when you select this menu item a window pops up that tells me what speed my current iMac is running at:</p>

<p>An example, although not an Apple iMac is my MacBook Pro which uses 1066 DDR3 SDRAM DIMMS:</p>

<p>You will see I am using a 2.4Ghz MacBook Pro that already has 4GB  of DDR3 RAM installed which is in this case, the maximum RAM I can run, but also  you now have the processor speed  and memory type and speed for your Apple computer.</p>
