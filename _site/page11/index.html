		<div class="post-content">I have been following the Apple [discussion thread on macintouch.com](http://www.macintouch.com/readerreports/apple/index.html#d30apr2016) with interest as I agree with a lot that's been said.

In the past, I loved the fact that Apple computers have been upgradable, but a lot of great stuff has been written by readers at [Macintouch](http://www.macintouch.com) about how the ugpradablity of the current Macs are almost non-existent now and that Apple has lost some of their loyal customers who need powerful machines to other OS's like Windows and Linux versions.

It's worth a look.

>Many price comparison websites use robots to gather pricing information from various vendors. This often leads to inaccurate or outdated prices, or prices for left-over, refurbished, and open-box machines. In addition, you rarely get information on free bundles, rebates, or discounts. As opposed to these sites, we use a real person to update our prices each morning. We visit the reseller's website to see the prices and bundles with our own eyes, and if that fails, we pick up the telephone and give them a call.

<br>

		<div class="post-content">Do you really need 16GB of RAM in a Chromebook? It seems like overkill. I have a 2GB and 4GB Chromebook and to be honest, I don't see any difference in performance. 

Also, the price - that's MacBook territory, and a pretty expensive ram upgrade to go from 4GB to 16GB 

 [HP's new Chromebook 13 is a Pixel for everybody](http://www.engadget.com/2016/04/28/hp-chromebook-13/)


> Only the top of the range model gets 16GB of RAM, paired with a Core m7-6Y75 for $1,029. Shipments are expected to start next month.

If you can live with 4GB, there's a $499.00 version. 

Still, it's a nice looking machine.
