  <p>We built this Website Speed Test to help you analyze the load speed of your websites and learn how to make them faster. It lets you identify what about a web page is fast, slow, too big, what best practices you’re not following, and so on. We have tried to make it useful both to experts and novices alike.</p>

  <p>In short, we wanted it to be a easy-to-use tool to help webmasters and web developers everywhere optimize the performance of their websites.</p>

<p><a href="http://g5center.net/hardware.html">Hardware - G5 Center</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Launched in 2003, the Power Mac G5 was the king of Apple’s lineup for about three years, moving from single CPU models to an eventual dual core and quad core lineup. The G5 was discontinued in 2006 to make way for Apple’s switch to Intel processors. If you get your hands on one or keep one lying around for video or legacy projects, you’ll find that it still packs a solid punch for a ten year old computer. Below are some suggestions on how to maximize your Power Mac to extend its life.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ve always wanted one of these but at the time a new one was still too expensive, but now that ugprades are affordable and the computer itself has dropped in price, now is the time to search for one.</p>

<p>This is time well spent learning how to do this, as you get a free website hosting and plain text sites are much faster than a wordpress site too.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Jekyll takes your content written in Markdown, passes it through your templates and spits it out as a complete static website, ready to be served. GitHub Pages conveniently serves the website directly from your GitHub repository so that you don’t have to deal with any hosting.</p>

  <p>eero is the world’s first home WiFi system. A set of three eeros covers the typical home. They work in perfect unison to deliver hyper-fast, super-stable WiFi to every square foot of your house. It’s simple to set up. Easy to manage. And gets better over time with new features and improved performance. Stream video, get work done, or swipe right in any room — not just next to your router. Finally. WiFi that actually works.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wonder what it would be like to be able to get wi-fi in the kitchen behind the fridge?</p>

<p>They are a bit pricier than the typical $100 router, but they look easier to setup and use too.</p>

<p>This feature sounds like it would be very useful:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Keep is great for making lists, for example a shopping list. If you actually title one of your lists “shopping list,” you can add new items to it without even opening the app. It’s a simple matter of pulling up your Google voice search by tapping the mic in the search bar or using the “OK Google” hotword.</p>
