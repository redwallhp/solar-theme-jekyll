    <h1><a href="/2011/10/how-to-get-a-crucial-memory-scan/">How To Get a Crucial Memory Scan</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p><img class="alignleft" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41XadRhTtrL._SL500_AA300_.jpg" alt="Crucial 8GB Kit (4GBx2), 204-pin SODIMM, DDR3 PC3-10600 Memory Module (CT2KIT51264BC1339)" width="300" height="300" />One of the easiest ways to upgrade your notebook or desktop computer is with a <strong>**<a href="http://www.jdoqocy.com/click-1548159-5527922">Crucial Memory Scan</a></strong><strong>. The Crucial Memory Scanner is safe to use for both Mac and Windows OS systems and has to be the **<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">easiest way to get the right RAM for your computer</a></strong> that’s guaranteed to work and be compatible without the fear of wondering if the RAM you buy is the right RAM for your notebook or desktop PC.</p>

<p><strong>How The Crucial Memory Scan Works</strong></p>

<p>It can be difficult to figure out what memory you need to buy for your computer. As an example depending on what Apple MacBook Pro model you have or need to ugprade the memory on, you may need either PC5300, PC 1066, or PC 1333Mhz DDR 3 menory upgrades for your MacBook Pro. But how do you know what speed memory upgrade you need to buy? All this goes away with a Crucial Memory Scan and takes only minutes to perform an will not upload or share any files on your computer so you can be assured that your privacy is respected as all this program does is scan for the system information from your computer so that it can help decide on the perfect memory upgrade for your Mac or PC.</p>

<p>To Get started with the Crucial Memory Scanner you need to download the <a href="http://www.jdoqocy.com/click-1548159-5527922">crucial memory scan software</a> and then run the crucial memory software on your PC. There’s a good chance your computer will ask you if you ar e sure you want to run this application as it was downloaded from the internet and the answer is yes as Crucial is a well respected computer company that has no interest in harming your privacy or computer security as they are a business and by offering this free software to scan your computer they will of course, recommend Crucial memory upgrades.</p>

<p>The crucial scanner will even direct you to the correct part number for your computer, or in the case where your computer might be eligible for more than one upgrade the crucial scan will offer a selection of ram upgrades for your Mac or PC.</p>

<p>**Crucial Solid State Hard Drive Recommendations<br />
**</p>

<p>In addition to using the Crucial system scan method to get the right memory for your computer, you can also use the <a>Crucial SSD, or Solid Stat Drive recommendation tool</a> to assist you in finding a solid state drive for your computer in addition to adding more computer memory.</p>

<p>Crucial Solid State Hard Drives are starting to drop in price where they are an affordable computer upgrade. Compared to the price of RAM, the solid state drive still has a way to go before the general public will jump in and accept them but it’s only a matter of time as the hard drive sizes for solid state technology continue to grow and yet the same time drop in price.</p>

<p>Using the Crucial solid state tool to upgrade your hard drive ensures that your computer can accept a solid state hard drive upgrade, as not all computer models are equipped for such without extensive modification or sometimes not at all, so I advise you to be sure you can use or benefit from a solid state hard drive upgrade before you spend your hard earned money only to find a solid state drive is not compatible.</p>

<p>These are just two free tools provided by Crucial Technology free of charge to help you with your computer upgrade needs with the hope that you get a fair deal on memory and solid state hard drives.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2011/09/acer-aspire-4551-notebook-computer-memory-upgrade-prices/">Acer Aspire 4551 Notebook Computer Memory Upgrade Prices</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003NR847I/ref=as_li_ss_til?tag=ramseeker-20&amp;camp=213381&amp;creative=390973&amp;linkCode=as4&amp;creativeASIN=B003NR847I&amp;adid=0BHYSP5P6NCVJF42MG7J&amp;"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2980" title="Acer Aspire 4551 Memory Upgrades" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Screen-Shot-2011-09-27-at-3.26.14-PM.png" alt="Cheapest Acer Aspire 4551 RAM " width="311" height="341" /><br />
</a></p>

<p>The <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003NR847I/ref=as_li_ss_til?tag=ramseeker-20&amp;camp=213381&amp;creative=390973&amp;linkCode=as4&amp;creativeASIN=B003NR847I&amp;adid=0BHYSP5P6NCVJF42MG7J&amp;">Acer Aspire 4551 notebook</a> **is a 2010 notebook model released from Acer and yet despite the fact that the Acer 4551 is a 2010 model when it comes to making this Acer Aspire laptop, the same holds true for this model too – **<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">adding more RAM</a></strong> is the best computing investment  you can  make for Acer notebooks, or any other brand too.</p>

<p>Peformance wise, this Acer offers the perfect mix of  speed and size in my opinion with a 14 inch LED display, AMD Athlon II Dual-core Processor P320(2.1GHz, 1MB L2 Cache) and up to 3.5 inch hours of battery life, if you own this computer notebook from Acer or find one on the used market, than you could do yourself a favor and add more ram.</p>

<p>The good news about the maximum RAM allowed for the Acer 4551 is that adding more RAM won’t kill you pocketbook like adding 16GB of RAM might. Due to the fact that out of the box the Acer 4551 comes with 3GB of RAM installed in the two memory upgrade slots available for ram upgrades  this means that you’ll only need to replace the 1GB memory upgrade module in slot B with with a bigger 2GB RAM upgrade for the Acer 4551.</p>

<p>According to current RAM prices, the <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">RAM upgrade for the Acer 4551</a></strong> should only run you about $29.99 for  a 4GB memory upgrade Kit that consists of two DDR3 1333Mhz 2GB memory modules.</p>

<p><strong>Acer 4551 RAM Prices</strong></p>

<p>[table id=7 /]</p>

<p>As you can see from the memory prices above ram for this Acer notebook is pretty cheap. I recommend you upgrade the Acer 4551 RAM with the identical memory upgrades by buying two new RAM upgrades. It’s not a requirement, but you will have less of a chance of memory errors or other such computing fun and for the price difference between an individual RAM chip and a complete memory upgrade kit you’re better off buying new ram cheap than trying to be cheap.</p>

<p>Some memory upgrade stores will even offer you a trade in for your old RAM or you can sell the memory removed from the Acer 4551 and save even more money on your overall ram upgrade for the Acer 4551 notebook computer.</p>

<p><strong>Acer 4551 Solid State Drives</strong></p>

<p>Now that it’s 2011 there’s another way to improve the speed on your Acer 4551 and that’s by replacing the Acer notebooks’ hard drive with a new solid state drive. Budget SSD Drives can be had for about $100 right now and that’s a big price drop compared to earlier this year where the cost for solid state hard drives was still prohibitive.</p>

<p>The benefit of solid state drives for any Acer notebook is that there’s no moving parts so less chance of hard drive failure and significantly faster startup time and overall performance increase.</p>

<p>For about $100, maybe a litte more **<a href="http://www.dpbolvw.net/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT25664BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT25664BC1339">buy a 4GB RAM Upgrade Kit</a> **and a **<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/best-ssd-hard-drives-for-2011/" title="Best SSD Hard Drives for 2011">64GB SSD Drive</a> **and you have a fast Acer notebook that’s the perfect travel notebook thanks to the 14 inch screen size and lighter weight than other 15 inch notebooks like the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/dell-inspiron-15r-2nd-generation-laptop-memory-upgrades/" title="Dell Inspiron 15R 2nd Generation Laptop Memory Upgrades">Dell Inspiron 15R</a>, for example.</p>

**</p>

<p>I have been waiting for this.<img class="alignleft" src="http://images.crucial.com/images/resources/large/package/204-pinSODIMMDDR3.gif" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></p>

<p>You can now buy** <a href="http://www.kqzyfj.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT102464BF1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT102464BF1339">8GB DDR3 1333MHz sodimms from Crucial Technology</a>** directly and install up to <strong>16GB of Crucial RAM in your MacBook Pro</strong>, Mac Mini, and other PC notebooks that can accept up to 16GB like the MacBook Pro’s Can.</p>

<p>In a way, this isn’t really news and places like <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/owc">OWC</a> and <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/ramjet">RAMJET</a> have offered 16GB ram kits for the 2011 Apple MacBook Pros for sometime. Since February for OWC if I recall, but this is the first I have seen where you can <strong>buy 8GB crucial sodimms for MacBook to max out your Macbook Pro</strong> way past what Apple suggests and for a pretty good price considering Crucial is a name brand memory manufacturer.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, not only are these Crucial 8gb sodimms finally available to buy online, they’re pretty cheap when you compare the prices to the other vendors that offer 16GB MacBook Pro memory upgrade kits:</p>

<p>[table id=1 /]</p>

<p>Is it worth it to spend over $700 on RAM in 2011? That’s up to you, but I don’t know that I would right now unless you <strong>really need all the speed you can possibly get your hands on</strong>. Usually if you’ve got a MacBook Pro you’re a professiona even when you consider the higher price these 8GB sodimms still demand they’re a bargain when you compare the price of ram against your profits. More RAM allows you to work faster, especially if you’re working with image processing or video.</p>

<p>But these <strong><a href="http://www.kqzyfj.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT102464BF1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT102464BF1339">8GB 1333Mhz sodimms from Crucial</a></strong> are still pretty pricey when you compare to the <strong><a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT2KIT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1339">8GB Crucial MacBook Pro Kits</a></strong> that will run you just over $50. (see MacBook Pro Price Chart Above) There are cheaper 8GB upgrades above too in the MacBook Pro Price table but you may want to consider this upgrade over the 8GB option which is considerably cheaper. 4GBx2 DDR3 1333Mhz sodimms are a much better deal than 8GBx2 DDR3 sodimms still in 2011. Who knows what happens in 2012 for ram prices, but my guess is these 8GB Crucial sodimms will drop in price like a stone over the next year, just like the 4GB memory modules did.</p>

<p>Another reason to wait a bit when it comes to upgrading your MacBook Pro to 16GB is that there’s <a href="http://www.macrumors.com" title="macbook pro 2012 rumors">rumors of new 2012 MacBook Pros</a> down the road and you may be better off waiting until the new Apple Pro notebooks are released so you compare your options: Upgrade your 2011 MacBook Pro – or buy a new 2011 MacBook Pro, which might have the option to install even more RAM than the 16GB limit the MBP’s have today.</p>

<p>But if you are ready to <strong><a href="http://www.kqzyfj.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT102464BF1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT102464BF1339">buy 16GB of RAM for MacBook Pros</a></strong>, the <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">Crucial Brand</a></strong> is one of the few brands I can recommend without hesitation.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004YLCLM6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B004YLCLM6">Best Price on Apple Mac Mini Intel Core i5 2.3Ghz (Mid 2011) </a></strong></p>

<p>The Apple Mac Mini with an Intel Core i5 2.3GHz processor is the <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;redirect=true&amp;ref_=sr_nr_n_0&amp;keywords=apple%20computer&amp;bbn=493964&amp;qid=1314967620&amp;rnid=493964&amp;rh=n%3A172282%2Ck%3Aapple%20computer%2Cn%3A%21493964%2Cn%3A541966#?_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">cheapest Apple computer you can buy</a></strong> and makes a great choice for a student computer or home theater or music server, just two applications the Apple Mac Mini could be used for.</p>

<p>One reason the <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004YLCLM6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B004YLCLM6">Mac Mini is so cheap</a></strong>, is that this is the only Apple computer that doesn’t come shipped with a keyboard, mouse or monitor. If you need these, you may be better off <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;x=0&amp;ref_=nb_sb_noss&amp;y=0&amp;field-keywords=imac&amp;url=search-alias%3Daps#?_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">buying an Apple iMac</a></strong> instead as the savings on this cheap desktop from Apple will be much less when you factor in the cost of Apple peripherals.</p>

<p>The Apple Mac Mini ships standard from Apple with just 2GB of memory installed in it from Apple (one reason the Mac Mini is so cheap) but using the two available memory slots in the Apple Mac Mini you can install up to 8GB of RAM by adding a <strong>8GB Mac Mini Memory Upgrade Kit</strong> that is priced currently at about $50* you could see an additional 50% or more of a performance upgrade by upgrading the 2011 Apple Mac Mini to the full 8GB of RAM it can recognize.</p>

<p><strong>Where To Buy Mac Mini 2.3 GHz RAM.<br />
**<br />
One store that sells name brand memory for Mac Mini as well as other computer brands is <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial" title="crucial mac mini memory">Crucial Technology</a>, but as I write this the cheapest Mac Mini RAM for the Intel Core i5 2011 version is Corsair memory available **<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002YUF8ZG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=B002YUF8ZG" title="Mac Mini RAM on Sale">on sale at Amazon</a></strong> and beats the Crucial memory price by a fair margin.</p>

<p>With ram prices so cheap for Apple Mac Mini Intel Core i5 2.3 GHz, I fully recommend you go straight to the 8GB maximum memory by filling the two available RAM slots the Mac Mini offers. If you’re really on a tight budget you could buy a 4GB Mac Mini RAM kit instead that still doubles your RAM, but with 8GB of RAM so cheap you’re best to go straight to 8GB of Mac Mini RAM.</p>

<p>**How To Install RAM in Apple Mac Mini Intel Core i5 2.3GHz<br />
**</p>

<p>Memory Installation on the Apple Mac Mini does not need to be done by a service professional (this wasn’t always the case) and if you follow the <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4432#1">Mac Mini RAM instructions</a> from Apple you will have no problems. The design on the new Mac Mini’s are brilliant as this is one of the only Apple computers you don’t need to use any tools with. The bottom cover on the underside of the Mac Mini twists off like you would a lid on a jar where the the entire RAM modules are easily accessible and with your fingers only you can remove and replace Apple Mac Mini Memory with ease.</p>

<p>*ram prices change for all computers and recently have been dropping.</p>

<p>The Acer Aspire 1825PT notebook is a 14 inch Acer notebook released in May 2010 and offers a P250 processor running at 2.3GHz with 3GB of RAM installed from the factory with a 320GB hard drive and runs windows 7 as the default operating system. With a sale price in the $500 area this notebook from Acer is a competitive notebook for the price and one of many notebooks available for sale if you’re in the market to buy a new Acer notebook.</p>

<p><strong>Acer Aspire 1825PT Memory Upgrades</strong></p>

<p>This is a relatively new Acer notebook that requires the use of DDR3 1066 SDRAM sodimms and this particular Acer notebook offers two memory upgrade slots and can be upgraded to 8GB by replacing the factory Acer RAM with two 4GB sdram sodimms. An <strong><a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT2KIT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT2KIT51264BC1339">8GB Acer memory upgrade</a></strong> is the cheapest price I have seen in the fifteen years I have been monitoring ram prices and 8GB should cost you less than $50 for 8GB of Acer RAM. This is one of the better deals on RAM upgrades for Acer notebook computers today.</p>

<p>**How To Upgrade Acer Aspire 1825PT<br />
**</p>

<p>Like most Acer notebooks access to the ram upgrades are accessible via a small door or compartment on the bottom of the Acer Aspire 1825. Once you have the notebook batter removed, you can safely remove the door, revealing the ram upgrade slots on your Acer notebook.</p>

<p>Remove the Acer factory RAM upgrades by pulling back the two small tabs that hold the ram upgrades in place and gently pull on the memory module to remove the acer factory memory upgrade. Once both Acer Aspire 1825 memory upgrade slots are free, all you need to do is to reverse this process by adding 2x4GB DDR3 SDRAM sodimms to maximize both the Acer Aspire 1825 Memory and also Performance. You should find that after completing the ram upgrade your Acer notebook will run faster and smoother with the added 8GB of RAM.</p>

<p>The Apple iMac is Apple’s <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;x=0&amp;ref_=nb_sb_noss&amp;y=0&amp;field-keywords=apple%20imac&amp;url=search-alias%3Daps#?_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">Best Selling Apple Desktop</a></strong> and has been for years ever since introduced in the now very dated teal color scheme of the 1990’s with that little and revolutionary at the time, round Apple mouse with just the one button.</p>

<p>But in 2010, one of the best selling Apple iMac models had been the Apple iMac 3.06GHz model and with the fast dual core 3.06GHz Intel i3 processor that features a 256k level 2 cache, for each core and combines a 4GB system cache for both cores this is still a fast and entirely upgradeable Apple iMac despite the fact that it is now discontinued with faster iMacs released in 2011.</p>

<p>But just because you have an older 2010 Apple iMac means you need to upgrade the entire computer and you can increase the speed of your 21.5 inch iMac by <strong>buying and adding more memory</strong> instead.</p>

<p>This particular Apple iMac has a maximum memory allotment of 16GB of iMac Memory, even though Apple ships this iMac with just 4GB of RAM standard. You can quadruple the amount of RAM from 4GB to 16GB with this iMac by removing and replacing the factory installed 4GB configured as two two GB memory modules and replacing the Apple iMac RAM with much bigger 4GB memory modules x 4 to get the maximum benefit 16GB of RAM will provide in the 2010 Apple iMac 3.06GHz.</p>

<p><strong>What Memory Do I Buy for the Apple iMac 3.06GHz?</strong></p>

<p>This 2010 Apple iMac requires the <strong><a href="http://www.dpbolvw.net/click-1548159-10273954?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fstore%2Faffiliateredirect.asp%3Fimodule%3DCT51264BC1339%26aid%3D10273954%26cid%3D777292%26subid%3D890%26PRS%3Duscj&amp;cjsku=CT51264BC1339">purchase of 4GB DDR3 SDRAM SODIMMs running at 1333Mhz</a></strong>. Unlike some iMacs in the past, this particular iMac part number requires that only DDR3 1333MHz RAM be installed and the chart below shows you the cheapest prices for iMac RAM for both the 2010 and 2011 Apple iMac Models:</p>

<p><strong>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000T8WN8U/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=B000T8WN8U">PNY OPTIMA 4GB (2x2GB) Dual Channel Kit DDR2 667 MHz PC2-5300 Notebook / Laptop SODIMM Memory Modules</a> are some of the cheapest ddr2 sodimms on sale today</strong></p>

<p>The <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">4GB DDR2 PC2-5300 memory upgrade kit</a></strong> is a little dated and pretty much any currently shipping and best selling notebook will only accept faster memory upgrades typically running at twice that speed or faster with speeds of 1066Mhz or even 1333Mhz, this is still a very popular memory upgrade to buy, especially if you have an older MacBook or MacBook Pro you need upgrading or want to squeeze a little life out of.</p>

<p>For under $50, this <strong><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">cheap 4GB ddr2 pc5300 notebook memory upgrade</a></strong> is a bargain, especially when you compare what it may cost you to buy a new notebook. You should find that after installing this DDR2 laptop memory upgrade into your Mac or PC notebook that the laptop should run much faster and depending on the processor speed of your processor and other speed issues it’s not unthinkable to double your computer’s processing speed by adding a 4GB memory upgrade kit.</p>

<p>**RAM upgrades Are Cheap<br />
**</p>

<p>RAM Upgrades in 2011 are so cheap right now, I can’t stress enough if you have been on the fence about a ram upgrade, now is the time to buy. 4GB RAM upgrades kits, regardless of what notebook computer you want to install this memory upgrade into have never been cheaper. This memory module kit currently retails for under $50 and that’s half the price you would have paid for a ram upgrade just a few short months ago.</p>

<p>I don’t track ram prices for DDR2 memory any more as I tend to concentrate on the newer and more popular memory, but an example of RAM prices dropping would be that in April an 8GB DDR3 memory upgrade kit would have cost $93.00, and today the cheapest 8GB DDR3 RAM Price can be had for under $40, which should be affordable by anybody looking to upgrade their notebook RAM cheaply in 2011.</p>
