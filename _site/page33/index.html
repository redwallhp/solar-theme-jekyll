The Apple Mac Mini is my new favorite Mac in the Apple lineup and for one reason: It&#8217;s cheap.

I have already compared the iMac and Mac Mini and when you do the math, it&#8217;s not hard to save up  to $300 when you buy a Mac Mini and external mouse, monitor, and keyboard as opposed to pulling the trigger on an iMac.

What could you do with the extra money you save? Buy a SSD drive, as they are getting big enough and cheap enough to use as your main hard drive. (with limitations). The biggest limitation being your budget, and remembering that you&#8217;re looking to upgrade a $600 desktop here. You have to stop and ask yourself is it really worth it to pour another $500 or so into it. If you add 16GB of RAM in addition to the Mac Mini, you may just be better off buying a Mac Pro.

Regardless, the Mac Mini SSD Drive options are many and here&#8217;s a few options to consider: These will also work just fine in your MacBook Pro and iMacs too.

### [Crucial 128 GB m4 2.5-Inch Solid State Drive SATA 6Gb/s CT128M4SSD2<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3076" title="Best Crucial SSD Drive for Mac Mini" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Screen-Shot-2011-10-07-at-7.27.19-AM.png" alt="Cheap Mac Mini SSD Drive" width="312" height="242" />][1]

With a street price of under $200, the latest in solid state drive technology from Crucial comes in the form of the Crucial 128MB M4 SSD drive. At just 128MB, you may be limited in your storage space when compared to bigger conventional hard drives but you win when it comes to boot time and drive access speed, allowing you to work faster

The crucial m4 128MB solid state drive is the best selling SSD drive today, and is compatible with more than just the Apple Mac Mini, but works with all others in the Apple lineup and any other Windows OS model that can accept a 2.5 inch SATA form factor.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

### [Crucial 64 GB m4 2.5-Inch Solid State Drive SATA 6Gb/s CT064M4SSD2][2]

&nbsp;

[<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3080" title="Cheapest Mac Mini SSD" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Screen-Shot-2011-10-07-at-7.40.22-AM.png" alt="Best Price on a Mac Mini SSD" width="320" height="259" />][2]If you&#8217;re low on funds, and the 128GB is stretching your budget, you can opt for the cheaper SSD drive in Crucial&#8217;s lineup, [the 64GB version instead of the 128GB][2].  This gets you into one of the cheapest Mac Mini SSD drives available today for just a touch over $100.  You won&#8217;t have much room for files when compared to the bigger 128GB model, but as the Mac Mini isn&#8217;t going anywhere you can always buy a [cheap external drive][3] with more storage capacity and hook it  up to the little Mac. A hundred dollar SSD upgrade is the best bargain for a Mac Mini SSD option as it allows fast access to common files and the Mac OS for super fast startup times, yet doesn&#8217;t cost too much compared to the Mac Mini. Upgrade the Mac Min RAM to 8Gb at the same time, and for $150 or less, you have a much faster Mac Mini when you bought the Mac Mini from Apple.

**June 2012** &#8211; Finally after what seemed like an eternal wait for new 2012 Apple MacBooks, they have arrived!  
&nbsp;

The Apple MacBook Air is the [Mac Portable To Buy][2] in 2011 as we wait for the release of the 2012 MacBook Pro

It&#8217;s October already as I write this and if it were earlier this spring, I would have said that hands down, buy a new MacBook Pro today as they are fast and well designed notebook computers featuring fast processors. And with the capability, unofficially at least  &#8211; to accept  16GB of RAM.

The biggest question you may have had back then earlier in 2011 was which MacBook Pro Do I Buy? With 5 different models of MacBook Pros, such as the cheapest MacBook Pro out of the bunch, the 13inch MBP to the desktop replacement 17 inch MacBook Pros these new Apple notebooks came in enough different sizes and  price points that there would be a MacBook Pro for every need.

And then time slipped by and this summer we saw the release of  new Apple iMacs in May, the MacBook Air refresh in July, and the Mac Mini update happening in July too.  And suddenly, the once fast and fresh MacBook Pros lost a little bit of their lustre.

If you need to buy a Mac Desktop computer, the Mac Mini is the cheapest Mac you&#8217;ll see this year and is fast enough for most every day calculations, and even with the added cost of a monitor and keyboard and mouse, the Apple Mac Mini is still cheaper than an Apple iMac.

Then there&#8217;s the MacBook Air models, and  if you&#8217;re in the market for  a new MacBook Pro, you may want to consider these lightweight and fast notebooks instead of buying a MacBook Pro as they are currently the lightest and fastest notebook you can buy from Apple.

But what if you don&#8217;t want to buy a desktop Mac, as you need something portable and the MacBook Pros that were released in 2011 are looking a little dated.  This leaves you with three choices:

1. Buy a 2011 Apple MacBook Pro

2. Wait for the 2012 Apple MacBook Pro to be released.

3. Buy a 2011 Apple MacBook Air.

I can&#8217;t really recommend that you buy a brand new MBP today as the new 2012 MacBook Pros are probably right around the corner with release dates rumored to be as early as  this fall, but my guess is you&#8217;ll see a completely new MacBook Pro in 2012 that offers a new look (kiss the CD player goodbye), less weight with more RAM and SSD solid state drives as standard.

History has showed us over the past decade that January at MacWorld has been the release dates for previous generations of Apple Pro notebook models with a few refreshes in the fall, but my guess is that the MacBook Pros will not been until the new  year in 2012. Apple has just released a brand new Apple iPhone and iPod lineup, and a new iCloud and iOS is in the works this fall as well. They have more than enough products that are current to separate you from your money. The new MBP&#8217;s can wait until the new year.

Apple has relied on essentially the same design for their MacBook Pro and yes, they have made improvements in screen technology and thunderbolt parts, but it&#8217;s my opinion that the newer MacBook Pro versions will be souped up MacBook Air models.

One thought would be to offer a 13 inch and 15 inch MacBook Pro with faster processors and more RAM than the air models and leave the 17 inch MBP design alone, as this Apple notebook is often used as a desktop replacement  where one may need a CD Drive and all the ports you can muster.

All this to say: If you&#8217;re asking  when is a good time to buy  a MacBook Pro, now  is not the time. I would wait and see what the 2012 MacBook Pro models look like before you buy a Mac notebook in 2011. If you need to buy a new Mac notebook today, you might be better off  with the MacBook Air and then replace the Air with the new MacBook Pro from 2012 when the time comes if you feel the need to upgrade.

I do know I will be writing on my 2008 MacBook Pro until I see what Apple has in store for us for 2012. I don&#8217;t think that buying a 2011 MacBook Pro is a good deal right now.

   <B> <h1><a href="/2011/10/what-does-4gb-ram-cost/">What Does 4GB RAM Cost?</a></h1></B>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content">**4GB of RAM has never been cheaper than it is today**

The price on memory upgrades, or RAM if  you will changes constantly so rather then tell you what it costs for 4GB of RAM I&#8217;d rather show you with a price list of current ram prices for notebook computers. I chose notebooks, because there&#8217;s a good chance your next computer will be a notebook computer because the prices on notebook computers keep dropping in price over time.

An example: One of the best selling notebooks currently on sale at Amazon (I like buying my computers from Amazon, they offer quick shipping, and stock everything under the sun so I can place one order and then get on with life.  I don&#8217;t have to shop at different computer stores  &#8211; one for RAM, and one for the laptop)

Anyway, as an example, you can get into an [Asus netbook for about $350][1], which is  a pretty good deal for a notebook for web browsing and facebooking and  the like. And this particular Asus notebook  allows up to 8GB of RAM, meaning you&#8217;ll need to buy 4GB x 2 to fill the two available memory slots this notebook computer has.

Not only is this a pretty good deal on a notebook for under $400, but  also if you add RAM you&#8217;ll get a speed increase too Take a look at the  8GB Memory Upgrade Kits for this laptop computer:

&nbsp;

[table id=7 /]

As you can see, 4GB memory modules for 2011 notebooks are pretty cheap, and the 8GB memory upgrade kits save you more money on RAM as they are discounted usually as a memory upgrade kit, as opposed to a memory upgrade module.

If you have been sitting on the fence about a ram upgrade, now is  the best time to buy. In the fifteen years I have been keeping  track of the memory prices, ram has never ever been cheaper. Buy 4GB RAM now and be happy that you saved money and have a smoother and faster computer to boot.

<br>

		<div class="post-content">**[Cheap Apple iMacs at Amazon.][1]  
**

I like to shop.

I especially like to shop for stuff I&#8217;m interested in be it [home audio][2], [photography][3] or my favorite: [Apple computers][4]. But I also hate to pay full load when I don&#8217;t have to. In fact, that&#8217;s how ramseeker was born. I read in a forum about how nobody could find a fair price on memory and how Apple charged too much for ram. (they do).

I had seen some great memory prices while surfing the web from Crucial, 18004Memory, etc and  a website was born on helping you get a good deal on Apple Memory.

And I do the same thing for Apple iMacs when I am ready to buy a new Apple computer, and over the years again I have found just like the memory prices, you **can get  a better deal on a new  iMac if you don&#8217;t  buy the Apple iMac directly from Apple** as Apple will charge you full list price. Granted, Apple does offer  some deals on refurbished Macs and that&#8217;s great but I&#8217;m talking about where to buy an iMac cheaper than what Apple charges.

Oddly enough, Apple allows discounts on Apple iMacs from other computer stores and that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s possible to get a better price on an  iMac at Amazon than it is if you would buy the Apple iMac from Apple. Sometimes Apple will offer rebates and other promotions such as the [back to school program][5] recently offered but for the most part when you buy from Apple you&#8217;re paying full pop day in and day out.

Deals on Apple iMacs happen all the time and a few stores you should check out for iMac deals I have listed below. Some, such as MacMall will throw in free software such as Parallels to sweeten the deal but also allow you to run windows software on your Apple iMac or  in some cases you can get a free printer with your  new Apple iMac too.  If you spend  an hour searching for the best Apple iMac prices online you could save ten percent or even higher on your new Apple iMac computer purchase.

**Best Apple iMac Stores: **

[**Amazon**][6]

[**MacMall**][7]

**[Best Buy][8]**

[**Adorama**][9]

These are but a few stores where you can get a better deal on an iMac than paying full price from an Apple iMac. You&#8217;re just ordering a box with your credit card so it&#8217;s my opinion that as long as the warranty will still be honored in the rare case I do have an iMac problem,  I don&#8217;t care where the Apple iMac comes  from.

Now, don&#8217;t go thinking you&#8217;ll get a half price iMac or anything like that, because you won&#8217;t. Apple restricts resellers to display the MAP  (minimum advertised price) on Apple iMacs and that&#8217;s why when you shop for an iMac you may see the price displayed at these stores to be the same price as what Apple charges. The only way to get around this restriction is to add the iMac to your shopping cart  (don&#8217;t worry, you can remove it later) to see the lowest price from these online stores. It&#8217;s a bit confusing and some stores do  a horrible job at explaining how all this works and probably lose sales on Apple products because of it, while other store  do a great job of explaining why you need to add the iMac to your cart to get the best price.

Adding the iMac to a shopping cart is not complicated as it&#8217;s just one click and you could save as much as ten percent on a new iMac. Add the freebies places like MacMall add to the iMac deal and your total savings on a brand new iMac could be almost a couple hundred bucks. I think that saving over $100 on a brand new Apple iMac is worth the effort of a half hour or so to do some research on getting the best iMac deal you can find.

Of course, once you buy an iMac, you need to fill it with RAM for the best performance, and if you buy RAM from the cheapest memory stores, you won&#8217;t get hosed on a ram upgrade. Whatever you do, don&#8217;t buy Apple RAM as its&#8217;outrageously overpriced. You can find much better deals on RAM for Apple iMacs  below:

   <B> <h1><a href="/2011/10/what-is-the-best-apple-desktop-computer-to-buy-in-2011/">What is the Best Apple Desktop Computer To Buy in 2011?</a></h1></B>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content">&nbsp;

**The Cheapest Apple Desktop Computer Might be the Best Desktop from Apple in 2011  
**  
It&#8217;s October 2011 as I write this, and this will probably change over time as new computer models could be released before the year&#8217;s end and  in time to take advantage of Christmas 2011 sales on computers, there&#8217;s a good chance that the computers for sale in 2011 have already been released.

**The Best Apple Desktop Computer for 2011. **

Earlier this year, when I made this list I would have said that an Apple MacBook Pro or even the Apple iMac would  have been perfect choices for Apple Computers. We haven&#8217;t seen a new Mac Pro Model this year at all from Apple so  we can scratch that off the list as it&#8217;s my opinion that the 2010 Mac Pros should be discontinued or at least have received a refresh to the lineup  this year.

Before the Apple event yesterday announcing the iPhone 4s, I had hoped  that Apple would bump up  the Mac Pro lineup with new models, but now that the cat&#8217;s out of the bag we know that Apple is concentrating on phones and and [iPods][1] in time for the holiday season. A smart move, professionally, but personally I would have liked to see to see a [new Mac Pro][2] under my tree this year.

The **[cheapest Apple Mac][3]** might be your best bet for an Apple Desktop computer to buy in 2011, with the 2nd place going to the [Apple iMac][4]. A Mac Mini and external monitor may not be as elegant as the Apple iMac with it&#8217;s all in one design but it&#8217;s possible  you can buy a 21 inch desktop computer cheaper than if you were to opt for the  all in one  Apple iMac Design

**Let&#8217;s Compare Apple Desktops**

The cheapest Apple iMac you can get into is the [Apple iMac 21.5 inch model at $1125.00][4] or so from Amazon. The cheapo iMac features a 2.5 GHz Intel i5 Processor, 500GB of hard drive space and 4GB of RAM.

The cheapest Apple computer you can buy, period is the [Apple Mac Mini at about $568][3] from Amazon at time of writing. That&#8217;s close to half price of the iMac. The specs for the Apple Mac Mini are 2.3GHz, 2GB of RAM and a 500GB hard drive.

You can&#8217;t bump the processor speed on the Mac Mini, so based purely on processor speed the Apple iMac wins. But we&#8217;re talking .2GHz of speed differences between the two and at double the price of the Mac Mini (without the needed accessories like monitor and keyboard) you have to ask yourself **is the Apple iMac worth it**?

Yes, the iMac features a LCD display the Mac Mini does not have, and a keyboard and mouse are included in the box as well but all of these items can be bought as well as the display.  The ram is a little lighter on the stock Mac Mini too,  so that needs to be rectified, but **[8GB of RAM is so cheap today][5]** you should  upgrade the ram regardless of what mac you decide to buy.

Total for a Mac Mini with accessories:

Apple Mac Mini: $568.00

[Apple Keyboard: $69.00  
][6]  
[Apple Magic Mouse: $69.00][7]

[21.5 inch Acer Display: $109.00  
][8]

This gives us a bluetooth mouse and keyboard that are wireless and I chose the best selling 21.5 inch display for this example that&#8217;s pretty cheap too, at just over $100. The display may be the deciding factor here. Unless you do a side by side comparison of the two monitors there&#8217;s no way to tell which LCD display is preferable, so I went with the cheapest 21.5 inch monitor I could find.

The Total Cost for a Mac Mini and Accessories based on my calculations above comes to $815.00.

Compared to the cheapest iMac Price of $1125, you save a touch over $300 if you buy the Mac Mini over the iMac.

The Pros of the Apple iMac include more ram and a cable free all in one footprint. No monitor cables. The Cons of the Apple iMac is the price. If you&#8217;re looking to buy the cheapest Apple computer desktop package then the example above gets you into a current 2011 Apple desktop for under $1000. Well under, in fact.

I&#8217;m in the market for a new Desktop Mac and I&#8217;m leaning towards the Mac Mini as my next Mac as the speed of the computer matters less and less to me as the computer is waiting for me most of the time now and with the extra savings I could get into a bigger LCD display giving me more screen space, and for the computing I tend to do that&#8217;s a bigger deal than having the fastest Apple Computer in 2011.

There&#8217;s also the fact that the Mac Mini setup is considerably cheaper than an iMac. $300 buys me a new iPod or gets me close to an iPad or tablet device than if I had bought the Mac Mini. I can live with a cable or two on my desktop for a $300 savings overall.

I&#8217;ve been working with Apple computers for so long that I sometimes forget that not everybody has the same skillset and knowledge as I do and  may have questions about their new iMac, or even if they are [ready to buy an iMac][1] they may need help with choosing the best Apple iMac for their needs  or even ask if the Apple iMac is right for them in the first place, and would they be better off buying a cheaper windows PC.

**Ask iMac Questions and Get iMac Answers on iMac Forums **

Thanks to the wonders of the internet there&#8217;s a whole world of information out there about Apple iMacs, on both new and old [discontinued iMacs][2]  and as such lots of iMac users are ready to help you with your questions, but also allow you  to join a community designed around the Apple iMac where you can discusss the pros and cons of your favorite Apple desktop compute  for consumers.

Of course,  the [biggest iMac community][3] is found at  the mothership at Apple with forums dedicated to both the newer Intel based Apple iMacs but also the slower PPC Apple iMacs too are discussed at length at Apple with lots of knowledgeable  Apple users willing to help and discuss the Apple iMac with you. From help with iMac Hardware or iMac software you&#8217;ll find somebody  willing  to help you with your iMac questions.
