   <B> <h1><a href="/2016/04/19/switched-to-jekyll-from-wordpress/">Why I Ditched Wordpress for Jekyll</a></h1></B>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content">I know other sites in the Apple community like to stick to the tried and true and look pretty much the same since the day they were launched, I get bored with the look of ramseeker and like to change things up from time to time.

Heck, it's only been [six months](http://ramseeker.com/2015/10/the-new-look/) since the last time I made changes to the look of ramseeker and here I am doing it again.

In the past, the changes were for the most part were cosmetic and usually due to a new wordpress theme I wanted to try but now I have gone and switched both the technology powering this site as well as the web hosting provider.

In short, I have come full circle. When I stared ramseeker in 1997 as a hobby site the site was static and if I recall, probably built with [pagemill](http://www.macworld.com/article/1014811/pagemill.html).

Later on, I switched to a dynamic site with php and a mysql database because that was the new technolgy and it allowed me to offer almost real-time price change info for memory upgrades here on ramseeker.

But to keep the speed up to the same speed as the static site, I had to change the web hosting to a much more expensive dedicated server from [pair networks](http://pair.com), and this helped to a certain degree, but over time it seemed like I always had to spend money on more ram for the server, or more space or some other cost, so in 2011 I said goodbye to pair networks and switched ramseeker over to using Wordpress as it was all the rage online as a quick and easy way to get a website built.

Since then I have tried various webhost for my wordpress site, but there always seemed to be a problem like waking up to finding you were hacked or monitoring theme, wordpress and plugin updates.

A switch to managed wordpress hosting removed most of my update worries as it was taken care of for me but it was still costly. Not as costly as my dedicated server, but still it was money out of my pocket.

I never really did like working with wordpress. I always found it a pain that I had to wait for a completely new page to preview my post before I hit the publish button and the plugins seemed to grow and grow and grow.

I have tried working with different themes as well but I never did find one that I really loved.

## Enter Jekyll, and Github Pages

![blogging with jekyll](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Sm7gY6n2sUsrcvF6SjT4pG2zvSRh623Do8dWHRWd4L_ZVlD2QLs1sOb4PR-3gMNRoAnpuvr4Z_vRKz262TL69ZW8eSXlIJIkidF6fZpS7mGMni4knNrV0KW7Ka5uM8fBVEM7bnViV5ynrFdElda5wb41LqXOFWaxlB9PEzWPuWpBagB-7uaB2aSZTgqo0FhSjFHtFYz0xBND4sDhKXMgOsbK0fkYzt3Njl-e8EdBh3Oq7IL29-LsC8j_ohckNmFBIBtp1RSjGM-UxvzdfDXVys7221z1ks8-6HTi4gXSUplucaJqufnlykjvSYWQwtWSipbZiINYOuOUrGmXns9jtrPxP4TndRgafen6udaxQYLMRqBTNuNj2KmAtWVxtWfXyqNjP0viPqUWf7A8qBLmd0le_h8ezMEOn56PC7QDlLiMe8aa6Ljf49t6MZ29i4eGJ2Si0gj-XiI-kHY7f50JkgXUdNh18zYpgmBblt_Di5pD8Kht7atCRys16Ju3j-i6RqpuGotXOnhG6q06FR8pA1xwL9O82BFjWsFyE-257SWXaMdmEGs10feoDhZS808ERh7iJg=w923-h1006-no)



I had read about static website hosting and found [jekyll](http://www.jekyllrb.com) and github pages. At first, the learning curve was pretty high as I had never used a terminal much being an Apple user I was used to launching apps and using WYSISWYG tools to create this site.

I had to learn the workings of [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), git and getting the site on [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) and have given up in frustration in the past many times, but I was always intrigued by Jekyll and static sites because Wordpress is much more of a CMS then I ever would need.

It's taken some time, but I have finally made the switch.

Getting my posts and pages out of Wordpress to Jekyyl was pretty easy thanks to an export plugin and now that my entire site is on my hard drive (actually google drive) in just text file format, I don't have to worry about my web hosting service dying because I have a folder of my entire site backed.

I prefer to [blog like a hacker ](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html) and use a simple text editor to write my posts and then push my changes to github via the terminal as it scrathes my inner geek (I do monitor ram prices after all), but github pages also offers a web-based way to blog via [prose.io](http://prose.io) which allows you to blog in a format similar to to using Wordpress.

I have found that writing in markdown is much easier than stopping your writing to select formatting when all I need is a couple of keyboard shortcuts to get what I need.

Lastly, there's the speed and cost benefits.

Because Jekyll creates just static pages and not much else there's never any database calls or other technology to slow down page load speed. In fact, I think the only extra I have here is a call to Google Analytics for my website stats.

I know wordpress offers caching plugins, but I spent too much time working with the technology behind the site instead of the site itself, and I hope this switch will allow me to concentrate on the latter instead of the former.

And the price can't be beat. I'm using [free software](http://atom.io) to write this article and then publishing to **[free web hosting](https://pages.github.com)**.


That's right. **free**, as in beer.

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/7dpMXem8SnmJulxNjiPdnDMnWm-aUGY9cMStBbE3QjOqT1bwk1i_r2CkYIFpJo1W9zd9zAdF5G-NB2fBVYVzs_FqH5Z-5lgXyykKxtZhoSXtzSR45SZf70wAcZNEiq6ngcTe4wP7l8aSuzrGZOUrTkmpmjYOKIfZ2zpBKZFZQ7Fhcn_OB2w2xOMKL7SM1mOWBsQ3GJxqWSLKOiIdsn8kxbK5Ia6v5yNhPHgt08u8tq4uV0HVnWuiBAsTB-5EfNq18KNapZJi_ts8zS6EMCGaKQCQ-R12hVqXI12HXSSZ0D0RHDuW0QblhWFnF7S5mzMpSHuGTZwbZi4EfVthjtgedhF2Y_2oOTcVwqRoEcNu4hPjkje34wZZyKWaXdSHgxZ2YRXZFub6Rl0rV0bIJVWA582ahuPa-d1YRVONXtrq8wxVwxL_8btkNseWtXYIBsKTYYzA1IjsNJUS3rr8e5oyeGr84mfr96vEgdpwEkgr9HWpFzFZq_eTMU_Si5uSoqCn8kHxqTUVXcNFLvt8dfKPi4IQib5HV1jXDqMIl2hIbRQzxLx8gJJPV6mT7illcPatddYerQ=w924-h662-no)

Previously my last wordpress hosting service was costing close to $100 monthly and free is much better than coughing up a hundred bucks a month. That money could buy me a new computer each and every year with ease if I wanted too instead.

I think that's a much better deal. In fact, almost too good. It did take me some time to make the switch but now that I have, I am very glad I have.

I have also trimmed down the design to the bare minumum. The free (again) theme I am using is [Kactus](https://github.com/nickbalestra/kactus) which is based on [Cactus for Mac](http://cactusformac.com/). It's a clean look and the only mods I have made is to add some ram prices to the top of the page, and as mentioned above - Google Analytics.

To summarize I am really pleased with the latest change and I feel it was worth the time to learn a complete new way to publish ramseeker.com. You really can't beat free and fast when it comes to hosting your website that looks great and loads fast on any device

   <B> <h1><a href="/2016/04/19/Apple-MacBook-Air-13-8GB-RAM/">13 inch MacBook Air Now Ships with 8GB of RAM as Default Configuration</a></h1></B>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content">Apple today quietly bumped the standard configuration of the 13 inch MacBook Air to [8GB of RAM](http://www.apple.com/macbook-air/specs.html). Considering that 8GB of RAM is so cheap ([about $30.00](http://amzn.to/1WcNgUd)) this isn't that big of deal when it comes down to it, but it will give the MacBook Air 13 inch a bit more breathing room for applications that need a bit more RAM or for opening more applications.

Considering that the MacBook Air is one of the current Apple computers you **cannot** upgrade the ram on, this is pretty good news regardless and even though the MacBook Air is due for a refresh (or discontinuation) the 13 inch MacBook Air remains one of the best values for an Apple notebook you can buy today, and this 8GB upgrade only makes the 13 inch MacBook Air a better value than the 11 inch model which still only ships with 4GB of RAM in the standard configuration.

<br>

		<div class="post-content">Microsoft is [offering a trade in program][1] where you can get up to $200.00 for your older PC or $300 for your Mac:

> For your Trade-in to qualify for the promotion it must be a working, complete and undamaged Laptop or Macbook up to six years old. Laptops and Macbooks must have a minimum 11.3” display. Your Trade-in must be complete with a working battery and power supply. Please do not return monitors, keyboards or mice. 

One very interesting thing I noted that was [according the photos][2] you can even send them a Mac with missing keys.

I&#8217;m not sure why you would ever want to do this and switching from a Mac to Windows seems like a bad idea all around and considering the price you can get for a Mac that&#8217;s just six years old you&#8217;re probably better off selling the Mac on your own and using the funds for your new Windows Machine.

   <B> <h1><a href="/2015/10/what-about-the-mac-pro/">What About the Mac Pro?</a></h1></B>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content">William Gallagher (with Mike Wuerthele) ] [posted an article at MacNN][1] on what Apple might plan to do with the Mac Pro:

> You look at the profile of the Mac Pro longingly, and you have to wonder whether it&#8217;s been forgotten.
> 
> Of course, we thought that back in the beginning of 2013 when this new, cylindrical, tiny Mac Pro was announced. People had given up on ever seeing an update for the aluminum slab-side Mac Pro, they&#8217;d given up on Apple, and they felt that Apple had given up on its creative professional users, who were the company&#8217;s core audience for many years previously. 

I don&#8217;t think that Apple has forgotten about the Mac Pro, but it&#8217;s now a very specialized item that&#8217;s aimed at a specific group of users. Also now that the iMacs can be almost and [if not as fast][2] as the Mac Pros, I know that if I was in the Market for a new desktop and the speeds are about the same, I would want to buy the iMac because it includes a 5k display where the Mac Pro doesn&#8217;t. I think that feature alone would want me to chose the iMac.

The Mac Pro has never seen as regular updates as the other consumer based models and considering a 2013 Mac Pro is still holding it&#8217;s own over newer Macs, I don&#8217;t see the need for Apple to upgrade this model for some time yet.

<br>

		<div class="post-content">OWC is the first memory vendor I have found to date to carry the [1866MHZ ram upgrades you need ][1]to max out the RAM on the Late 2015 27 inch iMacs:

Currently, they stock the following:

  * 4GB modules
  * 8gb modules
  * 16gb modules

This means that you have a few choices for upgrade configurations using these 3 different memory upgrade sizes combined with the 4 slots available and if you really need it you can spend **more than $1000** on ram for new 27 inch iMac models. I didn&#8217;t think that was possible in this day and age still.

Your options for ram upgrades are:

  * 8GB Memory upgrade kits
  * 16GB Memory upgrade kits
  * 32GB memory upgrade kits
  * 64GB memory upgrade kits 

Remember these new late 2015 iMacs don&#8217;t take the same ram as the older models so the pricing is different for the newer and more expensive RAM. You need 1866MHz PC3-14900 SO-DIMMS for Apple&#8217;s latest Macs.
