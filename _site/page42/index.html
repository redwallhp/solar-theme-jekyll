<p>There was a time when Apple just had one product  and that was the Apple Macintosh computer, but with the Mac now available in so many different flavors not to mention tablet computers like the Apple iPad and MP3 players such as the iPod – the selection can be a bit overwhelming for both the Brand New Apple computer user and professional alike.</p>

		<div class="post-content"><p>Cheapest Mac Pro RAM Prices.</p>

<p>Below are the current and cheapest prices on Mac Pro Memory from a wide selection of memory stores that you can trust to get a good deal on Mac Pro Memory.</p>

<p>[table id=15 /]</p>

<p>Cheap Mac Pro RAM (or, Mac Pro Memory) may not be the best deal on Mac Pro RAM as you think it might be if you set the value of cheap just on price alone. I know, I compare prices on Mac Pro memory so this might seem as if I am contradicting myself, but all I have done and continue to do is look for the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com">best Mac Pro RAM Prices</a>. I never really suggest that you buy Mac Pro RAM from one vendor or another as I feel it’s your hard earned money so you get to decide where to buy Mac Pro Memory.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ZR4M6I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B003ZR4M6I">Cheapest Mac Pro</a></strong></p>

<p>But Cheap RAM for Mac Pros should not be the only requirement for shopping for Mac Pro memory upgrades. The Apple Mac Pro is not a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fbestsellers%2Fpc%2F565098%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref_%3Dpd_ts_zgc_pc_565098_mor1&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">cheap computer</a> and in fact, it’s the most expensive desktop Mac you can buy and when it comes to ram upgrades for Apple Mac Pros, the RAM is anything but cheap.</p>

<p>That said, in the six months or so since the latest Apple Mac Pros were released (we’ll call them mid 2010 models) you can now install up to 64GB of RAM into the latest Mac Pro models and Mac Pro memory prices have dropped significantly over the past six months. Case in point – 64GB of Mac Pro RAM in the summer of 2010 would cost you just over $3000. Today in early 2011, that same memory upgrade from the same memory store costs as little as $1800. That’s getting close to half price for Mac Pro memory in just a few months.</p>

<p>If you need more memory to get work done, then buy ram now and be happy that you have the fastest Mac Pro possible (assuming you are maxing out your Mac Pro with 64GB) and don’t worry about the cost. The cheapest RAM or savings from buying the cheapest RAM may sound like a good deal on memory but you might be better off with name brand ram or at very least buying Mac Pro Memory from a memory store you can trust.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2011/01/cheap-mac-mini-ram/">Cheap Mac Mini RAM</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>To get the maximum performance out of the Mac Mini, you can and should install more RAM in the Mac Mini (here’s the instructions from Apple on <a href="http://manuals.info.apple.com/en_US/Mac_mini_Mid2010_User_Guide.pdf">how to install Mac Mini RAM</a>) you want page 34. You can install 8GB of DDR3 1066 SDRAM in the latest Apple Mac Mini and I recommend that you do as Mac Mini RAM is cheap, in fact memory upgrades for any Apple Computer is a great deal right now and the cheapest it’s been is some time. Now is the time to buy ram. regardless of whether it’s for The Mac Mini, any other Mac or even a PC such as a HP notebook computer.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013FK9U2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0013FK9U2">Cheapest Mac Mini</a></strong>The Apple Mac Mini is the <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013FK9U2?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0013FK9U2">cheapest Apple computer</a></strong> you can buy in 2011. (and, it’s on sale too). But one thing that will make this little wonder even better would be to max out the memory on the Apple Mac Mini.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Installing the RAM on the newest Mac Mini couldn’t be easier – all you do is flip the Mac Mini over, twist the cover like you would on a jar of peanut butter and the RAM and memory slots are right there. Apple does suggest that you have an Apple certified technician install the memory upgrade on a Mac Mini but I don’t think that’s needed at all if you’re careful with static electricity you should be fine. But be aware that if something does go wrong installin memory by yourself, your warranty on your new Mac Mini could be voided.</p>

<p>To remove the original RAM on a Mac Mini, there’s two little clips that hold the memory module down – seperate these and the memory module pops up at a 45 degree angle (or thereabouts) and you gently remove the memory from the memory upgrade slot. You repeat this for the second memory upgrade module that’s directly below and then you have to empty memory upgrade slots that are now free to use 4GB DDR3 SDRAM x 2 to get you to the maximum of 8GB of memory allowed on the latest Mac Mini models. (older mac mini’s were not as easy to install memory in, so if you’re in the market for RAM for a discontinued Mac Mini you might be best to find either an apple certified technician to install the memory for you, or if the warranty on the Mac Mini is long gone you might want to chance installing the RAM yourself.</p>

<p><strong>Where to Buy Mac Mini RAM Cheap</strong></p>

<p>As I mentioned above, Mac mini ram is the cheapest it’s ever been and you can buy much cheaper RAM from a selection of memory stores that I can recommend as being quality places to buy memory from. Below is a chart of the current <strong>best and cheapest ram for Apple Mac Mini</strong>.</p>

<p>The iMac, in my opinion is probably the best value in an Apple Personal Computer, regardless of year. From the very first Apple iMac to the current Apple iMacs with Intel i3 and i5 processors, with the Apple iMac you get a well designed desktop computer that in it’s latest incarnation with the summer 2010 refresh also offers you a choice of processor speeds, screen sizes and price points but they all offer the same sleek design that hardly takes any room on your desktop.</p>

<p>One thing that the latest iMacs need (and with RAM so cheap these days, I don’t understand why Apple doesn’t ship the Apple iMac’s full of RAM) is more RAM. For a select few, the memory installed at the factory will be more than ample if you’re just surfing facebook or email or the like, but for the rest of us that want to get the most performance we can out of Apple’s best selling desktop computer, adding more memory is the cheapest way to do that and usually offers more bang per buck than adding hard drives or installing software could.</p>

<p>The best part about iMac memory upgrades, is that if you do it right you only do it once and the memory upgrade is good for the life of the computer. Fill your iMac with RAM, and forget about it. You can buy ram from Apple for the iMac, but even though more moderately priced than earlier years buying RAM direct from Apple is still a pricey proposition.</p>

<p>A better, and cheaper option is to buy iMac Memory from a memory store you can trust to offer the same technical specs required for the 2010 Apple iMacs but at a cheaper price. Most memory stores offer a lifetime guarantee free shipping and support in the rare case you do have trouble with your iMac RAM you know you will get the help you need. This is rarely needed as the memory shops test the RAM upgrades prior to shipping.</p>

<p>**Where to Buy iMac RAM and for the Cheapest Price.<br />
**</p>

<p>I don’t recommend any one specific memory store as I figure it’s your money you’re spending and you have different requirements about how much you will pay for ram, but also the perceived value attached with <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">brand name memory</a> and other factors to consider when buying RAM. But, most of you just want the cheapest iMac RAM and I have created a chart that lists the lowest memory prices from memory vendors you can trust.</p>

<p>The title of this article could be misunderstood or misread and that’s not what we want. To clarify: RAM or memory is a physical product. RAM is not a software upgrade or downloadable online. But, you can save a lot of money buying RAM online from a selection of online memory stores and it’s been my goal over the past ten years or so to help you get the best deal you can on memory upgrades, regardless of whether you need to buy RAM for your Apple, HP or Dell computer, just to name a few computer manufacturers and their products that will run much much faster when you add more memory.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001KB6Z2U/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001KB6Z2U"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1139" title="Best Selling Computer RAM" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-24-at-1.41.59-PM.png" alt="" width="312" height="292" /></a></p>

<p>I’m going to assume you are in the market to save money on memory and RAM and want a fair price from a memory store you can trust to sell and ship you RAM upgrades fast and without any fuss or trouble. With RAM, there can be huge markups, especially when buying ram from the manufacturer directly, such as Dell or HP or even Apple. It’s convenient to buy memory from the computer manufacturer, but accessories are expensive and unless time is more important to you than money (which could be the case) it’s ill advised.</p>

<p>Your best bet when it comes to low priced ram upgrades is to buy RAM online from a trusted third party memory store. You will see to the right of this article that I have a list of the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com">best memory stores</a> and if that’s not a big enough list of options I have even <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/where-to-buy-computer-memory-upgrades/">more memory sellers</a> you can choose from when you’re looking for the best price on your memory upgrades.</p>

<p>In most cases, the cheapest ram will be generic memory as opposed to name brand RAM upgrades. The difference between the two in most cases, besides ram prices – is the name brand RAM might be considered the better RAM due to the name, but that’s debatable and the generic memory upgrades are still made and tested to the computer manufacturers exact specifications, so in most cases you will be just fine by ordering generic RAM and saving money the next time you need to upgrade your notebook or desktop computer.</p>

<p>What do you get when you combine the best selling Apple MacBook with the most RAM or memory you can install in a current shipping MacBook Pro? A small, powerful – and thanks in part to the 8GB of RAM that maxes out the 13.3 inch MacBook Pro – notebook computer from Apple that has the most ram possible installed and in most cases, for less than $100 for MacBook Pro 8GB<br />
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1149" title="Cheapest MacBook Pro" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-24-at-7.39.14-AM1.png" alt="Best MacBook Pro Price" width="283" height="223" /></a></p>

<p>You can even offset the the cost of 8GB MacBook Pro RAM by selling your old, or original memory that came installed in the MacBook Pro 13 inch back to <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/oempcworld">some</a> <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/ramjet">memory</a> <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memoryx">manufacturers</a> who will take your older memory in as a trade where you offset the cost and get 8GB RAM for MacBook Pro even cheaper than you could if you bought the RAM</p>

<p>To max out the 13 inch MBP, you need to remove (in most cases) the 2 x 2GB memory modules in the two memory upgrade slots and replace them with 2x 4GB RAM for MacBook Pro. There’s quite a selection of best memory stores (see sidebar) to buy MacBook RAM from but to get the best price you should compare prices on both 4GB memory modules for MacBook Pro and also 8GB memory upgrade kits too as some stores only market their memory upgrades as ram modules, while others prefer to sell you a 8GB MacBook RAM Upgrade KIT which consists of two 4GB DDR3 1066 SDRAM memory modules for MacBook Pro</p>

<p>Stores I recommend for memory upgrades are <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">Crucial</a>, <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/OWC">OWC</a>, <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/dms">Data Memory Systems</a>, <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/1800">18004Memory</a>, <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/memoryx">MemoryX</a> and <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/oempcworld">OEMPCWORLD</a></p>

<p>There’s other memory stores but over the 14 yeas of tracking memory upgrades I find that these few stores support and sell quality Apple Memory Upgrades for less than what you would pay if you were to buy the RAM from Apple, which while convenient sometimes – is not the best way to save money on ram upgrades.</p>

<p>In 2011, it does not cost a lot of money for <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">apple memory upgrades</a>, and in fact now is the perfect time to buy mac memory as RAM has never been cheaper than right now for Apple Computers.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PS9UKW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001PS9UKW"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1146" title="Best Selling Apple RAM" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-24-at-1.55.27-PM.png" alt="Best Apple RAM Price" width="308" height="237" /></a></p>

<p>Let’s take a look at today’s RAM prices: As I write this you can <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/crucial">buy memory for MacBook Pros</a> for as little as $49 for 4GB of MacBook Pro memory, one of the best selling Apple notebooks available today. To maximize current memory on any modern MacBook Pro will need to replace the 4GB that ships as standard equipment when the MacBook Pro comes from Apple and replace it with 4GB memory modules x 2 for a total of 8GB of MacBook Pro RAM. To offset the cost of your MacBook Pro RAM there are many memory stores that will <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/oempcworld">buy back</a> your <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/ramjet">old ram</a> and and credit you against the newer and larger memory upgrades – regardless of which Apple computer you need RAM for and making the memory for your Apple Computer even that much cheaper. It’s possible you could <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com">upgrade the RAM on your Mac</a> for under $50 for most current shipping Apple computers – and even less if you’re looking to upgrade older Macs with cheaper and smaller ram modules.</p>

<p>When it comes to upgrading the memory on older Macintosh computers, you do need to be aware of the price and performance ratio, as some older Macs might not be worth it to add more memory to. Your computing dollar might be better spent on buying a new Mac, rather than upgrading the memory on an old computer where your performance dollar might be better spent.</p>

<p>Below are the best prices on Apple RAM for all current Apple computers such as Apple iMac, MacBook, MacBook Pro and Mac Pro</p>

<p><strong>Best and Cheapest RAM for MacBook Pro</strong></p>

<p>The Apple MacBook Pro might just very well be the most popular Apple computer made by Apple to date. Yes, it is priced more than the MacBook as the professional version of Apple’s notebook computer offers more features and benefits of the MacBook Pro. I won’t compare the MacBook against the MacBook Pro with this article as that’s not the point but the MacBook Pros do offer larger screen size, faster processor speeds and in my opinion, what is probabl the most important feature: the ability to add more RAM for even faster performance.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1149" title="Cheapest MacBook Pro" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-24-at-7.39.14-AM1.png" alt="Best MacBook Pro Price" width="283" height="223" /></a></p>

<p>It makes no sense to me why you would buy the best notebook computer from Apple and then just leave it sit there with the RAM that came from the factory, when for under $100 you could maximize the performance of your MacBook Pro. This advice applies to both the latest and greatest MacBook Pros to the older MacBook Pros too that are just fine for simpler tasks like email, text editing and even <a href="http://www.facebook.com">surfing facebook</a> if that’s your thing.</p>

<p>RAM Prices for Apple MacBook Pros are cheap and get a bit cheaper every day it seems and for less than a dinner out you can maximize the performance on your professional Apple Computer.</p>

<p>The MacBook, from Apple could arguably be the best notebook computer available today from Apple, as this consumer based laptop offers a small footprint and price/performance ratio that can’t be beat when compared to the big brother in the Apple lineup: The Apple MacBook Pro.</p>

<p>But for most consumers this small laptop is the perfect choice as the digital hub between your iPhone, iPod, and any other consumer electronic item – such as a digital camera. Most buyers of the Apple MacBook should upgrade the memory at time of purchase, and I recommend that unless you have money to burn that you save money on memory upgrades and buy ram from a cheaper third party, and since on the internet, price is king – I have gathered and created a chart of current ram prices for both new and old Apple MacBook models. The older MacBook models, up to about 2007 require and use PC5300 DDR2 SDRAM sodimms, while the later unibody macbooks can accept a much faster memory upgrade in the form of DDR3 1066mhz SDRAM sodimms.</p>

<p>Depending on the specific MacBook model you have you might be able to install either 2 or 4GB or memory as the maximum RAM amount – and on the older MacBook models it’s quite possbile to squeeze 3GB or 6GB in them although this is not supported by Apple and I cannot recommend this MacBook memory upgrade.</p>
