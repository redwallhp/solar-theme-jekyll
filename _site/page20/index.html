    <h1><a href="/2013/06/05/france-removes-internet-cut-off/">Microsoft's Trade In Program</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>Microsoft is <a href="https://easytradeup.com/us/en/pages/tradeup/home">offering a trade in program</a> where you can get up to $200.00 for your older PC or $300 for your Mac:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For your Trade-in to qualify for the promotion it must be a working, complete and undamaged Laptop or Macbook up to six years old. Laptops and Macbooks must have a minimum 11.3” display. Your Trade-in must be complete with a working battery and power supply. Please do not return monitors, keyboards or mice.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One interesting thing I noted that was <a href="https://easytradeup.com/us/en/pages/tradeup/trade-ins">according the photos</a> you can even send them a Mac with missing keys.</p>

<p>I’m not sure why you would ever want to do this and switching from a Mac to Windows seems like a bad idea all around and considering the price you can get for a Mac that’s just six years old you’re probably better off selling the Mac on your own and using the funds for your new Windows Machine.</p>

<p><strong>Not Yet.  You can’t buy 32GB MacBook Pro Memory Upgrades</strong></p>

<p>The most memory you can install is 16GB into a current Apple MacBook Pro . The Apple MacBook Pro’s available on sale in 2013 max out at 16GB of RAMThis applies to all Apple MacBook Pros currently available online for sale:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Apple MacBook Pro 13-inch: 2.5GHz</li>
  <li>Apple MacBook Pro 13-inch: 2.9GHz</li>
  <li>Apple MacBook Pro 13-inch: 2.5GHz with Retina display</li>
  <li>Apple MacBook Pro 13-inch: 2.6GHz with Retina display</li>
  <li>Apple MacBook Pro 15-inch: 2.3GHz</li>
  <li>Apple Macbook Pro 15-inch: 2.4GHz with Retina display</li>
  <li>Apple MacBook Pro 15-inch: 2.7GHz with Retina display</li>
</ul>

<p>I wonder: will the maximum RAM upgrades you can install in any MacBook Pro will stop at 16GB. I guess it’s time to come to ask the question: <strong>How much ram do you need? </strong></p>

<p>The Apple MacBook Air models don’t even come with upgradable ram upgrades. If you buy a MacBook Air and want the most ram you can install in it  you better be ready to buy an 8GB MacBook Air because if you don’t you’re stuck with the 4GB option which leaves you little ram left over once you get the MacOS up and running. That said, small screens and 4GB of RAM seem to be a popular choice with Apple customers, especially if the MacBook Air is the secondary or light use computer. (another option would be to buy a chromebook)</p>

<p><strong>Apple MacBook Pro Memory Price Increases</strong></p>

<p>Also, RAM for Apple MacBook Pros have close to doubled in recent months. This is one of the very few memory price increases I have seen in the 15 years I have been monitoring ram prices for Apple computers. Usually, ram prices for Apple computer have always dropped in price over time.This is a first.</p>

<p>At current ram prices, the cheapest 16GB RAM for MacBook Pro you can buy  is about $125.00.  This means if you were to buy 32GB MacBook Pro RAM it’s quite possible that the price would be double that if not more with 32GB MacBook Pro memory costing as much as $250.00 to $300 or even more. And god forbid if you buy the memory from the Apple Store, as this option will <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/do-i-have-to-buy-memory-ram-from-apple/" title="Do I Have To Buy Memory RAM From Apple?">cost you much much more</a>.</p>

<p>A MacBook Pro with 32GB would be a pricey notebook computer. Assuming the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0074703CM/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0074703CM&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=ramseeker-20">best price you can get on a 13 inch MacBook Pro is about $1100.00 </a>, and adding 32GB MacBook Pro RAM costing you say $300, the cheapest MacBook Pro maxed out with 32Gb of RAM could cost you close to $1500.00, and if you upgrade to the Apple MacBook Pro 15-inch: 2.7GHz with Retina display you’d be north of 3 grand with 32GB of RAM installed.</p>

<p>This all assumes that ram prices for MacBook Pros stay stable too. If you start adding RAM later it might even cost you more. Now if you’ve got deep pockets or need the fastest MacBook Pro money can buy, then the price for 32GB of RAM for MacBook Pro is not much at all, especially if you use your MacBook Pro for photo or video editing you need the fastest MacBook Pro you can buy and the price of RAM or the MacBook Pro might not matter at all because you’re making money with your MacBook Pro.</p>

<p><strong>Sell Your Factory Installed MacBook Pro RAM</strong></p>

<p>One thing that might help offset the cost of 32GB would be to<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/where-can-i-sell-old-ram/" title="Where Can I Sell Old RAM?"> sell your old ram</a> that came with the MacBook Pro in the first place. Let’s say you’ve got 16GB of RAM from your MacBook Pro installed from the Apple directly. You could remove the ram and trade it for 32GB MBP ram. You won’t get a whole lot for the old ram but there’s many memory vendors that will allow you to trade in your old ram for larger memory upgrade modules effectively lowering the price you have to pay for the bigger ram for your MacBook Pro.</p>

<p><strong>You’re Going To Have To Wait for 32GB MacBook Pro RAM</strong></p>

<p>I don’t know any memory store that sells 32GB for MacBook Pro just yet. There’s MacBook Pro rumors that a 2013 refresh of the MacBook Pro’s could happen at WWDC later this summer but like all Apple rumors, that’s all it is at this time – a rumor.</p>

<p>Of course,<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/apple-macintosh-memory-16gb-macbook-pro-ram/" title="MacBook Pro 16GB RAM Upgrades"> just like I did with 16GB of RAM</a> I’ll let you know when 32GB of RAM for MacBook Pros does come available and of course I will find the lowest price you can pay for 32GB MacBook Pro Memory</p>

<h2>Best Laptop Computer Brands for 2013</h2>
In 2013 as smartphones and and tablets increase market share, you might think that the notebook computer is dead, but this is not the case because even though tablets and phones increase in popularity nothing can beat typing on a real and physical keyboard and a notebook computer is  the only portable computing device that offers such. With that in mind, here's a look at some of the best manufacturers of notebook computers for this year, in 2013.
<h2>Google</h2>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009LL9VDG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B009LL9VDG&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=ramseeker-20"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7231" alt="Notebook Deal under $400" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Screen-Shot-2013-02-13-at-9.38.09-AM-600x455.png" width="600" height="455" /></a>

New to the list of best selling notebooks this year when compared to last year is Google, with their line of notebook computers called chromebooks. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009LL9VDG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B009LL9VDG&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=ramseeker-20"><strong>Google offers some of the best selling notebooks</strong></a> this year thanks to the fact that these are the cheapest notebook computers you can buy. Take the Samsung ChromeBook for an example. At $249.00, you get an 11 inch notebook for 2013 that runs on the Google Chrome OS and offers excellent portable computing value for the price.

Some may argue that the Chromebook isn't a real notebook computer when compared to Dell or HP or other notebook brands but that's because you can't run traditional applications on it like you can on a Windows based notebook computer. But with the flexibility and price the chrome OS offers thanks to Google Drive applications and the popularity of blogging sites or software that don't require any applications but offer all work to be done online or in the cloud the chromebook is  an excellent notebook for the price and is small and light enough to be carried with you everywhere yet still offers USB ports, a full sized keyboard and a bright 11 inch LED display, it's no wonder that the chromebooks for 2013 are the best selling notebook computer brands in 2013 so far this year.

<h2>Apple</h2>

On the other end of the spectrum when comparing Apple notebooks to Google notebooks, you get one of the best selling computer brands this year, but at a price. The cheapest price for a notebook from Apple will cost you close to $1000, if not more, depending on what model you buy. The MacBook Air is what one might consider a direct competitor to the Google Chromebook when it comes to screen size (the 11 inch MacBook Air) but the OS is much more advanced on the Macintosh OS than if you were to buy a Chromebook. Google wants you to primarily to work in the cloud, while the MacBook is more of  a traditional PC. The advantages of the Apple notebooks vs Chromebooks is the OS and the available software. Faster processors and more RAM are also a distinct advantage of an Apple Macbook Air or MacBook Pro and if you've got other Apple products such as iPhones or iPods, they all work together without fuss or problems. Apple offers a high end solution for portable computing and charges a premium for the tight integration of hardware and software in Apple notebooks.

Dell has long been a price leader when it comes to buying a cheap notebook online and in 2013, this hasn't changed and their 2013 Dell Inspiron notebooks always tend to be one of the best selling notebooks of the year. The 15 inch Dell Inspiron is one example of a best selling notebook computer from Dell. Compared to the price of an Apple MacBook Pro, the Dell Inspiron is an absolute bargain at under $400.00 on sale for a full featured 15 inch notebook with a fast Intel Core i3 processor, 6gb of RAM and a 500GB hard drive all standard. The Inspiron also features one of the bigger displays when compared to the Apple or Google offerings with a 15.4 inch display. Windows 7 Home Premium is included for the price and you can upgrade to Windows 8 very inexpensively too if you feel the need.  There was a time when an under $500 notebook from Dell would be considered an absolute bargain but with notebook prices dropping over time thanks to cheaper components inside a Dell notebook you don't need to look too hard to get a great deal on a Dell notebook in 2013.

Despite the fact that Toshiba has the very worst naming conventions on their notebook PC's with long model numbers instead of memorable names like the other manufacturers of notebooks above, you should consider buying a Toshiba notebook in 2013 due to the fact that the folks at Toshiba make a very good high quality product. You can buy cheaper notebooks to be sure (Acer comes to mind) but when in the market for  a higher quality notebook at a great price don't hesitate to consider Toshiba notebook. Take the<strong> Toshiba Satellite C855D-S5320 </strong>for example.<strong>  With a street price of under $400 </strong>this is a great deal on a notebook for 2013. There's not too many under $400 notebook computers you can buy today that offers the quality you can expect from Toshiba.

Lenovo is a relatively new notebook computer brand but if you look closely at the Lenovo brand you will see that this brand is really a subsidy of IBM, a name in computing that dates back decades, so you can rest assured you are buying a quality product when you are considering the Lenovo brand. Offering a top ten notebook for 2013 is not easy in the notebook shopping landscape with so many deals being available for a notebook computer this year. Lenovo offers a sub $500 notebook computer in the form of the Lenovo G580 notebook that offers a 15.6 inch display and comes with a fast Intel Core i3 processor, 4GB of RAM with a 500GB hard drive and Windows 8 pre-installed.

When buying <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com">memory upgrades for your notebook</a> it's often because you <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Best-Sellers-Electronics-Laptop-Computers/zgbs/electronics/565108/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;tag=ramseeker-20">bought a brand new laptop for 2013</a></strong> at least, that's usually when I personally buy RAM because I want the fastest computer when the computer is brand new and not wait until the computer gets old and slower when compared to newer computer models, regardless of brand.
<h2>Best Laptop Computer Brands for 2013</h2>
In 2013 as smartphones and and tablets increase market share, you might think that the notebook computer is dead, but this is not the case because even though tablets and phones increase in popularity nothing can beat typing on a real and physical keyboard and a notebook computer is  the only portable computing device that offers such. With that in mind, here's a look at some of the best manufacturers of notebook computers for this year, in 2013.
<h2>Google</h2>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009LL9VDG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B009LL9VDG&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=ramseeker-20"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7231" alt="Notebook Deal under $400" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Screen-Shot-2013-02-13-at-9.38.09-AM-600x455.png" width="600" height="455" /></a>

New to the list of best selling notebooks this year when compared to last year is Google, with their line of notebook computers called chromebooks. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009LL9VDG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B009LL9VDG&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=ramseeker-20"><strong>Google offers some of the best selling notebooks</strong></a> this year thanks to the fact that these are the cheapest notebook computers you can buy. Take the Samsung ChromeBook for an example. At $249.00, you get an 11 inch notebook for 2013 that runs on the Google Chrome OS and offers excellent portable computing value for the price.

Some may argue that the Chromebook isn't a real notebook computer when compared to Dell or HP or other notebook brands but that's because you can't run traditional applications on it like you can on a Windows based notebook computer. But with the flexibility and price the chrome OS offers thanks to Google Drive applications and the popularity of blogging sites or software that don't require any applications but offer all work to be done online or in the cloud the chromebook is  an excellent notebook for the price and is small and light enough to be carried with you everywhere yet still offers USB ports, a full sized keyboard and a bright 11 inch LED display, it's no wonder that the chromebooks for 2013 are the best selling notebook computer brands in 2013 so far this year.

<h2>Apple</h2>

On the other end of the spectrum when comparing Apple notebooks to Google notebooks, you get one of the best selling computer brands this year, but at a price. The cheapest price for a notebook from Apple will cost you close to $1000, if not more, depending on what model you buy. The MacBook Air is what one might consider a direct competitor to the Google Chromebook when it comes to screen size (the 11 inch MacBook Air) but the OS is much more advanced on the Macintosh OS than if you were to buy a Chromebook. Google wants you to primarily to work in the cloud, while the MacBook is more of  a traditional PC. The advantages of the Apple notebooks vs Chromebooks is the OS and the available software. Faster processors and more RAM are also a distinct advantage of an Apple Macbook Air or MacBook Pro and if you've got other Apple products such as iPhones or iPods, they all work together without fuss or problems. Apple offers a high end solution for portable computing and charges a premium for the tight integration of hardware and software in Apple notebooks.

Dell has long been a price leader when it comes to buying a cheap notebook online and in 2013, this hasn't changed and their 2013 Dell Inspiron notebooks always tend to be one of the best selling notebooks of the year. The 15 inch Dell Inspiron is one example of a best selling notebook computer from Dell. Compared to the price of an Apple MacBook Pro, the Dell Inspiron is an absolute bargain at under $400.00 on sale for a full featured 15 inch notebook with a fast Intel Core i3 processor, 6gb of RAM and a 500GB hard drive all standard. The Inspiron also features one of the bigger displays when compared to the Apple or Google offerings with a 15.4 inch display. Windows 7 Home Premium is included for the price and you can upgrade to Windows 8 very inexpensively too if you feel the need.  There was a time when an under $500 notebook from Dell would be considered an absolute bargain but with notebook prices dropping over time thanks to cheaper components inside a Dell notebook you don't need to look too hard to get a great deal on a Dell notebook in 2013.

<h2>Toshiba</h2>

Despite the fact that Toshiba has the very worst naming conventions on their notebook PC's with long model numbers instead of memorable names like the other manufacturers of notebooks above, you should consider buying a Toshiba notebook in 2013 due to the fact that the folks at Toshiba make a very good high quality product. You can buy cheaper notebooks to be sure (Acer comes to mind) but when in the market for  a higher quality notebook at a great price don't hesitate to consider Toshiba notebook. Take the<strong> Toshiba Satellite C855D-S5320 </strong>for example.<strong>  With a street price of under $400 </strong>this is a great deal on a notebook for 2013. There's not too many under $400 notebook computers you can buy today that offers the quality you can expect from Toshiba. This particular model of Toshiba notebook features a E-Series Dual-Core E2-1800 1.7 GHz processor with a 15.6 inch display, Windows 8 and 4GB of RAM with a 500GB hard drive.

Lenovo is a relatively new notebook computer brand but if you look closely at the Lenovo brand you will see that this brand is really a subsidy of IBM, a name in computing that dates back decades, so you can rest assured you are buying a quality product when you are considering the Lenovo brand. Offering a top ten notebook for 2013 is not easy in the notebook shopping landscape with so many deals being available for a notebook computer this year. Lenovo offers a sub $500 notebook computer in the form of the Lenovo G580 notebook that offers a 15.6 inch display and comes with a fast Intel Core i3 processor, 4GB of RAM with a 500GB hard drive and Windows 8 pre-installed.

    <h1><a href="/2013/01/where-to-buy-windows-7-ram/">Where To Buy Windows 7 RAM</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>When you’re in the market for a brand new computer in 2013 most all computer buyers this year will tend to be buyers of notebook computers or even tablet computers, but both of those options may not be the best computer of 2013 for you. With a brand new laptop this year it will come equipped with a default install of Windows 8. Many say that Windows 8 is better than Windows 7 when you compare the two versions of Windows you can still buy today. (Why anyone would want to buy Vista is beyond me).</p>

<p>Despite the new Metro design and features offered by Windows 8, some (like me) actually prefer to stick with Windows 7. Why? Because it’s familiar. I still cannot get used to the new user interface of Windows 8, even if it is considered to be a better Windows operating system. Yes, you could install Windows 7 on a Windows 8 notebook, but then you will have to download Windows 7 from Amazon or some other online retailer that sells Windows 7 and this will cost you at least $100 or so. You’re better off keeping your older Windows 7 notebook and adding more memory to the notebook you have rather than try to install Windows 7 on a PC designed for Windows 8</p>

<p>Adding more memory to your PC running Windows 7 offers a very big speed increase and the ability to run more applications simultaneously than if you were to just to stick with the standard memory configurations on most notebooks running Windows 7.  It’s easy to add more ram to a Windows 7 notebook too – all you have to do is this:</p>

<p><strong>1. Find out what Memory Type you need to buy</strong>. Most online memory stores can help with this thanks to their online memory configurator. You usually just enter your PC manufacturer, model name and you will get information on what type of memory you need to buy, what the maximum is you can install in your PC and how many memory upgrade slots you have to replace the stock ram with the new RAM.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Remove the old Factory Memory Upgrades. </strong>In most cases, you will have to remove the original RAM from the factory to install new memory upgrades. This is especially true if you are trying to upgrade a notebook computer as there are usually just two memory upgrade slots to use so you will definitely have to remove the factory ram first. With desktop computers running Windows 7, you have a bit more room as there is usually many memory slots (4 or more) and not all memory slots tend to be filled by the factory leaving you with lots of room for additional desktop memory to be installed.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>3. Install Larger Memory Modules. </strong>Once you have removed the older memory modules, and have bought the new ram upgrades for you Windows 7 computer, all you need to do is add the newer  and larger ram upgrades.</p>
