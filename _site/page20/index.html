</div>

<p>It’s been some time since I wrote about the product MacBook as the last models were about 2010, but after half a decade of discontinuation, Apple’s <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbook/">announcement</a> changed all that and now if you’re going to buy a new Apple notebook computer in 2015 you have to ask your self – <strong>MacBook or MacBook Pro?</strong></p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="macbook-pros">2015 MacBook Pros</h2>

<h3 id="less-weight">Less Weight</h3>

<p>The benefits of the 2015 MacBook are more than a few, but the most obvious change for this <strong>brand new notebook from Apple</strong> is the size and weight of the notebook compared to other notebooks in this class. At just 2lbs in weight, this is the lightest notebook you can buy today from Apple, aside from buying an iPad and using it with an Apple Keyboard, but that’s really a different story compared to the MacBook because the iPad runs on a completely different operating system and as such is not really a fair comparison and some would argue that even with a keyboard the iPad is not a real computer (some would <a href="http://www.macstories.net/stories/ipad-air-2-review-why-the-ipad-became-my-main-computer/">argue differently</a>).</p>

<h3 id="less-ports">Less Ports</h3>

<p>So with the release of the Apple MacBook we have not only lightness compared to the MacBook Pro but also a completely different design that removes almost all the ports. Unlike the MBP, the MacBook Air offers just two ports – one for power via a USB-C connector and a headphone jack. <strong>That’s it.</strong> This could be considered a pro or con depending on the user but for my needs, which is mostly writing articles just like this one – I don’t need to connect anything to a computer other than perhaps a wireless mouse, but if I really needed to I could buy a bluetooth mouse to use.</p>

<p>I am going to call the lack of ports a pro because with the advent of dropbox and Google Drive and other cloud computing hosts, there’s no real need for external hard drives and usb flash sticks. One thing I might miss would be a SD card reader, but a lot of the higher end and even enthusiasts cameras now include wi-fi, so that’s not even a big deal. And, if you do need to hang some accessories off the 2015 MacBook there are <a href="http://www.belkin.com/us/Device/Mac/d/MacBook/">dongles you can buy.</a> that will allow you to work with memory cards and other USB 2.0 and USB 3.0 legacy devices</p>

<h3 id="better-keyboard">Better Keyboard</h3>

<p>The keyboard. I have not been able to test the keyboard of the MacBook but I think that after getting used to the new design with the butterfly keys vs the scissor style keyboards that have been around for a decade or more, this should be a better designed keyboard, assuming you can get used to the less travel than traditional keyboards</p>

<h3 id="better-battery-life">Better Battery Life</h3>

<p>The new MacBook is rated at up to 9 hours of battery life, which is not as good as the ten hours of life the MacBook Pro is spec’d at but for a small computer that weighs just 2lbs this is really good all day battery performance on this new 2015 Apple notebook.</p>

<h3 id="better-display">Better Display</h3>

<p>The MacBook offers a 12 inch retina display, but is a bit deeper (or taller) than the MacBook Pro’s thanks to the 16:10 ratio vs the 16:9 ratio of the MacBook Pro models. You might not think this would be a big deal, but if you’re like me and spend pretty much all your time in a document or web, you will appreciate the deeper display for <strong>less scrolling</strong> that allows you too keep your hands on the keyboard vs the mouse or trackpad.</p>

<h2 id="macbook-pro-pros">2015 MacBook Pro Pros</h2>

<p> </p>

<p>The 2015 MacBook Pros have a few advantages over the 2015 MacBook:</p>

<h3 id="bigger-screen-sizes">Bigger Screen Sizes</h3>

<p>Even the smallest MacBook Pro has a 13 inch display vs the 12 inch display on the MacBook, and if you want to go bigger you can even buy a 15 inch MacBook Pro too. Of course, these MacBook Pros are heavier than Apple’s new light netbook, but if you need a bigger display in a portable from the fruit company, then your only options are MacBook Pro models.</p>

<h3 id="faster-processors-for-more-speed">Faster Processors for More Speed</h3>

<p>The MacBook is not designed to be the fastest Apple notebook you can buy and features a pretty lightweight Intel Core M processor vs the Intel Core i5 and i7 options on the pro. If you do heavy duty stuff with your computer than the Pro is the computer you want to buy.</p>

<h3 id="bigger-battery-life">Bigger Battery Life</h3>

<p>It’s not much, but the MacBook Pro Battery life is rated at 10 hours vs 9 for the MacBook. It’s not a big difference and in some cases might not matter at all but if you need every bit of portable power you can than the MBP is the notebook from Apple you need for all day portable power.</p>

<h3 id="more-ports">More Ports</h3>

<p>The MacBook Pros are equipped with the ports we exepect on a professional computer like USB 3.0, HDMI, SD card readers, thunderbolt ports and so on. If you have stuff you want to connect to your MacBook Pro and hate the idea of dongles hanging off your MacBook you need to spring for the Pro version of this computer.</p>

<h3 id="mag-safe-power">Mag Safe Power</h3>

<p>One of the best ideas Apple ever had was the Magsafe connector that disconnected if the cable was pulled. This has saved countless accidents from people tripping over power cables and has saved my bacon on more than one occassion. I hope the omittance of Mag Safe connector on the new MacBook Pro is just a temporary thing.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>To summarize, both of these portable Apple computer lines offer different things for different people. If you need the lightest computer from Apple you can possibly get, then the Apple MacBook is for you, assuming you can live with the less ports and power. But if you’re a power user the MacBook Pro is only 3.5lbs, which is still a considerable weight loss compared to older models. If you need speed, a bigger screen size and all the ports you could ask for then the MacBook Pro is the computer to buy.</p>

  <p class="wp-caption-text">
    The first place you should check for a refurbished Mac is <a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple</a>
  </p>
</div>

<p> </p>

<p>One of the best ways to get deals on an Apple computer is to <strong>buy an Apple Refurbished Model</strong> vs buying a new Apple computer because you will save money on an Apple notebook or desktop and in most cases you will not be able to tell the difference between new or refurbished Apple computers.</p>

<p>This also applies to iPhones and iPads and even Apple accessories too because just because it’s not new doesn’t mean you can’t get a great deal on a previously Apple item regardless of what that may be. Here’s a few places to look for refurbished Apple computers.<!--more--></p>

<h2 id="apple"><a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple</a></h2>

<p>This one is pretty obvious I think and in most cases I find that for the newer models especially or even the just discontinued Macs and iPads that the Apple Store itself tends to have some of the best prices on refurbished computers and you can be sure that these computers that ship from Apple are rerfurbished correctly. Heck, Apple even calls these <a href="http://store.apple.com/us/browse/home/specialdeals/mac">Certified Refurbished</a> and they come with free shipping and a one year warranty too making these the best deals on Mac products.</p>

<p>The savings depend on the model but expect the savings to be in the area of 15-20% off. Some examples of current refurbished deals are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Refurbished 13.3 inch MacBook Pro for $929.00</li>
  <li>Refurbished Mac Mini 2014 for $419.00</li>
  <li>Refurbished MacBook Pro 15.4 inch for $1489.00</li>
</ul>

<p>These deals come and go all the time but the three above are discounted about 15% off and still have a full one year warranty from Apple. It’s really hard to beat buying a refurbished product directly from Apple.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2 id="amazon"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;field-keywords=refurbished%20apple%20laptop&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;sprefix=refurbished%20a,aps,209&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;url=search-alias=aps&amp;linkId=LRTZDJ5QJ7HL4U2L">Amazon</a></h2>

<p>Amazon is also a good source for refurbished Mac computers due to the sheer size of the Amazon marketplace. Unlike Apple that tends to sell refurbished models that have been <strong>just</strong> discontinued or even current, the Amazon refurbished models are available on an entire lineup of Apple products regardless of year and are available from a vast array of vendors. If you need an older Mac and want to buy refurbished Amazon is a good place to check for deals.</p>

<h2 id="other-world-computing"><a href="http://www.macsales.com">Other World Computing</a></h2>

<p>OWC has been in the business of serving the Apple community for over 25 years so there’s no hesitation on my part to suggest you check out not only their memory and ram upgrades for both new and used Apple products but also their selection of <a href="http://eshop.macsales.com/shop/Apple_Systems/Used/Macs_and_Tablets">refurbished Apple products</a>. At the time of writing this, Mac Mini models start at under699 with MacBook Air refurbished models available at just $519.00 and up. Inventory changes all the time at OWC when it comes to refurbished and used Macs so be sure to check regularly for the most current deals.</p>

<h2 id="mac-of-all-trades"><a href="http://www.macofalltrades.com">Mac of All Trades</a></h2>

<p>Mac of All Trades is another store worth checking out if you’re in the market for a refurbished Mac to buy. In business for over 20 years this vendor specializes in used and refurbished Apple products and current examples of pricing include factory sealed MacBook Pro models for400.00</p>

<h2 id="mac-mall"><a href="http://www.macmall.com/n/Refurb-Outlet/macNavLinks-macNavLinks.57">Mac Mall</a></h2>

<p>MacMall is another place to check for refurbished Apple Macs and other items and like the other vendors above has been in business for years and years so you know you can get an Apple product you can save money on from a store you can trust. In addition to refurbished products MacMall always has a deal or two on new Macs too so be sure to <a href="http://www.macmall.com/n/Black-Friday/macCustomPages-1007">check this out too</a><br />
‘</p>

<h2 id="ebay"><a href="http://www.ebay.com">eBay</a></h2>

<p>Of course, there’s also eBay and you might be able to find a deal on a used Mac that might be refurbished by either the factory or more likely sold as seller refurbished, meaning that the vendor bought the Macs in bulk and then cleaned them up or made any needed repairs . The disadvantage of the eBay vendors is that the experience can vary greatly between vendors and you really have to do your homework on buying used or refurbished Macs at auction. But, you can get some good deals and most every product is protected by eBay’s money back guarantee.</p>

<p>To summarize, I would check with <a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple</a> first to see if I can buy the Mac I want as a refurbished model, and if I could wait I would wait until the model I wanted to buy was in stock. Some refurbished models tend to sell very quickly – like Mac Mini’s so you might be out of luck when you want to buy one but if you are patient the products usually tend to show up again on the certified refurbished page so you still might be able to save about 15% or so on the Mac you want to buy.</p>

    Mac Mini memory upgrades are <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;field-keywords=mac%20mini%20ram&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;linkId=KYHSLX55I3VIHO5Y">really cheap</a>
  </p>
</div>

<p>When shopping for a Mac Mini in 2015, one of the things you do not have to worry about are ram upgrades you can do your self because on the 2014 Mac Mini models you cannot upgrade the ram on your Mac Mini yourself. This means if you are looking to buy an Apple Mac Mini of the 2014 model you better be sure you buy the model with enough RAM for your needs, and for this year that means you can buy a new Mac Mini with 4GB, 8GB or 16GB maximum ram that’s soldered on the motherboard and that means you can’t upgrade the ram yourself.</p>

<!--more-->

<p><strong>The 4GB Mac Mini</strong></p>

<p>The 4GB Mac Mini for 2014 is the cheapest Mac Mini you can buy this year but it also has the lowest when it comes to ram maximums and this relatively minor amount of RAM might mean you might want to consider adding more RAM to the Mac Mini via the Apple Store at the time of purchase. But then your cheap Mac Mini that was under $500 is now much more expensive and you might be better off buying:</p>

<p><strong>The 8GB Mac Mini</strong></p>

<p>The 8GB Model is priced under $700 and not only do you get more RAM for the price you also get some other features like a faster processor, and larger hard drive. If you need even more RAM for your Mac Mini (in most cases, 8Gb would be enough for everyday use) then you might consider adding more RAM to the 8GB model to max out the Mac Mini to 16GB, or you could buy:</p>

<p><strong>The 16GB Mac Mini</strong></p>

<p>Where to Buy RAM for 2012 and Later Mac Mini</p>

<p>If you have an older Mac Mini or are considering buying one due to the fact that these later models allow you to swap out the RAM and hard drives yourself easily (the hard drive upgrade on the Mac Mini can take a bit of work) then you’re best off buying the Mac Mini RAM yourself and upgrading the RAM on your own to both speed up your Mac and get greater longevity from it too. It’s not uncommon to have ten year old Mac Mini models still in use, and I wonder if this will be the case on the most recent models?</p>

<p>The Mac Mini RAM you need to buy depends on year and model or even part number so you’re best to refer to a <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/2012/05/who-has-the-best-memory-finder/">memory compatability chart</a> or if you prefer, I have a page dedicated to helping you find the <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/2014/10/mac-mini-memory-upgrade-prices/">right RAM for your Mac Mini</a> and once you know the type of RAM you need for the Mac Mini then all you need to do is to check the ram prices on Mac Mini RAM for your compatible model. Most recent Mac Mini models like the 2011 and 2012 models use <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/2014/10/mac-mini-memory-upgrade-prices/#ddr3-1600-mhz-memory-upgrade-prices">DDR3 1600Mhz memory</a> and the prices for RAM for these are reasonable and can be found at the following stores that sell memory for Mac Mini models:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">Amazon</a><br />
<a href="http://www.datamem.com">Data Memory Systems</a><br />

<a href="http://www.memoryx.net">Memory X</a><br />
<a href="http://www.oempcworld.com">OEMPCWORLD</a></p>

<h2 id="the-best-ram-for-apple-mac-mini">The Best RAM for Apple Mac Mini</h2>

<p>Regardless of what store you buy Mac Mini RAM from you need to buy memory from a reputable manufacturer like Kingston Memory or Crucial Memory and you need to be sure it is compatible for your Mac Mini Model. Again, if you have a current 2012-2011 Mac Mini the ram you need to buy is here:</p>

<p>This is a reputable brand name (Crucial) and is a pretty good price for 16GB of RAM for the Mac Mini right now. If you need to buy less than 16GB of RAM then the 8GB RAM for Mac Mini is currently priced at under $100 and is a great way to upgrade the older Mac Mini models which tended to ship with as little as 2GB of RAM so an 8GB RAM upgrade will quadruple the memory in these models:</p>

Unlike the MacBook Pro models that currently max out at 16Gb, the newer Apple iMac models can accept up to 32GB of RAM. <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/2014/10/apple-imac-memory-upgrade-prices/">See my chart</a> to see if your iMac can add that much ram, and if it can be sure to max out your RAM.</p>

<p>You will need to buy at least one 16GB RAM Upgrade kit for Apple iMac to get to the 32GB maximum. This depends on what your iMac shipped with from the factory. If you already have 16Gb of RAM you can just add another 16GB to get to the 32GB Max. Here’s a suggestion for an iMac 16GB RAM upgrade:<!--more--></p>

<p>This ram upgrade will work in the newest 5K retina iMac as well as some other models too from 2010 to 2013 as well so again, be sure to check my iMac ram compatibility chart to see how much RAM you can handle.</p>

<p>Don’t forget that if you need to replace the iMac ram you already have that you <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/2011/01/where-can-i-sell-old-ram/">can trade ram in</a> and get the ram even cheaper. There’s not a whole lot of memory stores that accept ram trades for older Macs but some do and it’s worth it to check it out if you’re not going to used the pulled ram when you upgrade.</p>

<p>My usual list of where to buy iMac RAM also applies to other Apple models too because in most cases if you have a relatively modern Mac from say the last 3 years or so, they <strong>all take the same memory upgrade</strong> so this advice on where to buy ram for iMac could also apply to MacBook Pro ram and Mac Mini Ram too because it’s all the same and the only difference is <strong>how much ram they can take</strong></p>

<p> </p>

<h2 id="imac-memory-upgrade-stores">iMac Memory Upgrade Stores</h2>

<p>The ram upgrade I linked to above is a memory upgrade from Amazon and it’s made by Crucial. Both the store or the brand don’t need an introduction and if you’re in the market to buy crucial ram over some other brand I find that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;field-keywords=crucial%20ram&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;sprefix=crucial%20ram,aps&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;url=search-alias=aps&amp;linkId=ISXRPOVF5JPSRMSF">best prices for Crucial ram</a> are from Amazon, and even though Crucial has their own online store you will tend to pay more there vs Amazon.</p>

<h2 id="crucial"><a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-1548159-10273954">Crucial</a></h2>

<p>Despite the fact that you can usually get a better deal from Amazon then you can from the Crucial store, the advantage of the Crucial store is their help in getting you the right ram. With Amazon (and to an extent some other vendors) you have to know what you are looking for but with Crucial there are numerous ways to find the right ram for your Apple iMac: You can use an Apple memory configurator or you can even download a little program you can run on your iMac that will tell you exactly how much and what type of RAM you need.</p>

<h2 id="owc"><a href="http://www.macsales.com">OWC</a></h2>

<p>Other World Computing needs no introduction to the Apple community and has been selling ram for iMacs since Day One of the first iMac release. OWC offers an easy to navigate site that makes it easy to find the right ram for your iMac and offers help in finding exactly what model of iMac you have as well as installation videos to help you upgrade the iMac ram yourself.</p>

<h2 id="data-memory-systems"><a href="http://www.datamemorysytems.com">Data Memory Systems</a></h2>

<p>Another memory upgrade store that’s been around for a very long time is Data Memory Systems and they offer ram for each and every Apple iMac model too. I find pricing to be very competitive and in most cases this memory upgrade store has some of best prices on iMac RAM at times.</p>

<h2 id="memoryx"><a href="http://www.memoryx.net">MemoryX</a></h2>

<p>Billed as the <strong>World’s Largest Memory Store</strong> MemoryX boasts to have the biggest memory selection and they just might be right. You should have no problem finding a ram upgrade for each and every iMac made – or any other Apple product you might want to add a memory upgrade to.</p>

<p>These are just a few of the best places to buy ram for Apple iMacs – regardless of year made.</p>

   <B> <h1><a href="/2013/06/05/france-removes-internet-cut-off/">Microsoft's Trade In Program</a></h1></B>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>Microsoft is <a href="https://easytradeup.com/us/en/pages/tradeup/home">offering a trade in program</a> where you can get up to $200.00 for your older PC or $300 for your Mac:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For your Trade-in to qualify for the promotion it must be a working, complete and undamaged Laptop or Macbook up to six years old. Laptops and Macbooks must have a minimum 11.3” display. Your Trade-in must be complete with a working battery and power supply. Please do not return monitors, keyboards or mice.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One interesting thing I noted that was <a href="https://easytradeup.com/us/en/pages/tradeup/trade-ins">according the photos</a> you can even send them a Mac with missing keys.</p>

<p>I’m not sure why you would ever want to do this and switching from a Mac to Windows seems like a bad idea all around and considering the price you can get for a Mac that’s just six years old you’re probably better off selling the Mac on your own and using the funds for your new Windows Machine.</p>
