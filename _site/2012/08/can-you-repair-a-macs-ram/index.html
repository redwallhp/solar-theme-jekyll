      No.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      If the RAM on your Mac is bad, or has gone bad <strong>it&#8217;s toast.</strong>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Your only option is to replace the RAM with new RAM and if you&#8217;re going to go to the trouble of buying new RAM to replace the dead RAM, I suggest you double (or even triple the RAM too) at the same time for on reason only. RAM is so cheap.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Just like current interest rates the prices have never been so low for so much memory in the over 15 years I have been monitoring RAM prices. It&#8217;s just a few years ago, you would have to pay over $1000 for a 16GB ram upgrade for the iMac and now that same upgrade will cost you nothing at all in comparison &#8211; usually under $100 and even less if you sell your old RAM. (this option may not be available to you if your current RAM upgrade has gone bad)
    </p>
    
    <p>
      But, before you go and replace ram be sure that it&#8217;s gone bad. I know <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/diagnosing-memory-problems-on-your-computer&amp;ei=zBQhUKXIMKK36QHgt4HIBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=unauthorizedredirect&amp;ct=targetlink&amp;ust=1344347092798233&amp;usg=AFQjCNG5ydFAjs1OvQvZX3BSNGyZZVKosg">Microsoft windows offers a memory test option</a>, and you can test the RAM on your Mac too using <a href="http://cdn.command-tab.com/2008/memtest_422.zip">memtest</a>.(direct download link).
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Another option to consider: Is the ram upgrade in your Mac or PC seated properly. I know from personal experience, this has happened to me where I thought I had installed memory on my Mac Mini only to find that I hadn&#8217;t and that the Mac would crash every time I woke from sleep. So I flipped the Mac Mini over, unscrewed the handy plastic cover (if only all Macs allowed such an easy upgrade) and removed and re-installed my memory upgrade ensuring that it was fully installed &#8211; sometimes you have to press hard on the memory module to have the ram seat in the memory upgrade slot correctly.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Once I had re-installed the RAM on my Mac Mini &#8211; all my crashing and startup errors were gone. It wasn&#8217;t the RAM that was bad afterall, it was the crummy installation job by yours truly. Â It costs you nothing to try and reinstall your ram in your computer or complete a full memory test so I suggest you check these two items before you spend your hard earned money on RAM you may not need to buy.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      If it turns out your memory really has gone south, the only option is to replace the RAM, but RAM is so cheap it&#8217;s worthwhile upgrading the RAM over replacing your PC. 8Gb of RAM currently is priced about $50 for most computer models and if your Mac or PC can handle it &#8211; I suggest going all the way to 16GB of RAM with street prices running you only about $100 for 16Gb of RAM today.
