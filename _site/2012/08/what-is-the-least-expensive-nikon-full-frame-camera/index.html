	<div class="post-content"><p>If you’re shooting any type of full frame lenses, your best bet is to shoot with a full frame camera vs a DX camera – especially if you’re shooting wide angle lenses and want to take advantage of their perspective and large viewing angle. On full frame cameras, the wide angles can really sing in getting you great photos whether you are shooting landscapes or group photos or perhaps you just want to get a different view on the world – shooting wide angle lenses allows you to do it.</p>

<p>If you’re shooting longer lenses, or even normal lenses on DX cameras like the Nikon D7000 for example, understand that any Nikon lens you mount on a Nikon DX camer will multiply the focal length by 1.5x. Your 35mm 1.8 becomes a 52mm 1.8 – In a way this is great because you now have a<a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/nikon-afs-nikkor-35mm-f1-8-dx-g-review-and-best-prices/" title="Nikon AFS Nikkor 35mm f/1.8 DX G Review and Best Prices."> very fast normal lens for under $200</a>, and if you shoot longer telephotos – they really help you extend your reach – great for shooting sports or birds when you can’t get close to the action.</p>

<p><strong>The Advantages of Full Frame Cameras</strong></p>

<p>The advantage of full frame cameras usually come in the terms of image quality. Because a full frame or FX camera’s sensor is bigger the images tend to be more natural because you’re not cramming as much pixels into such a small space. For me, the advantages of full frame are the wide angle lens use, but there’s ways around it by buying DX wide angle lenses but even at 18mm wide you may not find that wide enough. I would much prefer to shoot with my Nikon 20mm f/2.8 at 20mm than an 18-55 DX lens where the math works out to a 28mm focal length.</p>

<p><strong>The Cheapest Nikon Full Frame Camera</strong></p>

<p>For Nikon shooters, we currently have two options if you want to shoot in full frame, and that comes in the form of the Nikon D800 or Nikon D700.</p>

<p>The Nikon D700 is the cheaper of the two with a street price of about $2200. This is a four year old camera though and offers the technology that was the best at the time with 12 megapixels of resolution, outstanding low light performance and 51 point autofocus system. Check <a href="http:/http://www.adorama.com/INKD700.html&amp;KBID=64104"><strong>Adorama</strong></a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BTCSI6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001BTCSI6&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=ramseeker-20"><strong>Amazon</strong></a> and <a href="http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/570162-REG/Nikon_25444_D700_SLR_Digital_Camera.html/BI/8956/KBID/10401"><strong>B+H</strong></a> for the best prices on the Nikon D700</p>

<p>The Nikon D800 is the much newer full frame camera from Nikon and offers much higher resolution – almost 3x as much at 36MP, faster processors, and much newer technology than the much older Nikon D700. You’ll pay a premium for this though with a street price for the Nikon D800 of about $3000.00 online. Check <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0076AYNXM/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0076AYNXM&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=ramseeker-20"><strong>Amazon</strong></a>, <a href="http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/842926-REG/Nikon_D800_D_800_SLR_Digital_Camera.html/BI/8956/KBID/10401"><strong>B+H</strong> </a>and <a href="http://www.adorama.com/INKD800.html&amp;KBID=64104"><strong>Adorama</strong></a> for prices.</p>

<p>At the current time, the cheapest Nikon full frame camera is the Nikon D700. Is it worth it to skip the Nikon D700 and go to the Nikon D800? One question you have to ask yourself is do you shoot video, or are you planning to? The Nikon D700 does not offer HD video shooting while the Nikon D800 does. In my mind, this is the major difference between the Nikon D700 and Nikon D800 and depending on your answer the price you pay for the Nikon D800 – even though you may end up paying more for it than the Nikon D700 might be worth it.</p>
