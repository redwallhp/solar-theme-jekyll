	<div class="post-content"><p>PC Memory, in rare instances can go bad. RAM Memory is a very sensitive computer component that is susceptible to static electicity that can fry your memory very quickly, so it’s always a good idea to use an anti-static wristband and install ram in a humid environment to reduce the chance of static electricity. But even if you install the memory correctly you can still have problems with your PC memory but thankfully there are many methods to test your PC memory for any errors.</p>

<h2 id="remove-the-memory">Remove the Memory</h2>

<p>This seems kindof obvious I know, but one way to test ram to see if it’s bad is to remove and replace the memory upgrade with another memory chip. Usually, you have upgraded the ram in your PC with newer and larger memory upgrade modules, and if you still have the original factory installed memory upgrades all you have to do is replace the ram you suspect has gone bad with the older RAM. If your PC now runs without incident, then you know the RAM is bad and will have to be replaced. In the event of problems with your PC you should check your RAM for any problems</p>

<h2 id="free-pc-memory-testing-software">Free PC Memory Testing Software</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.softpedia.com/get/Tweak/Memory-Tweak/Microsoft-Windows-Memory-Diagnostic.shtml"><strong>Windows Memory Diagnostic</strong></a></p>

<p>This memory testing software is like Memtest86 above, as it does not require an operating system to run and will run on any PC. Just download the ISO and follow the instructions to burn a bootable CD to test your PC memory with the Windows Memory Diagnostic Tool</p>

<p><a href="http://www.memtest.org/"><strong>MemTest86+</strong></a></p>
