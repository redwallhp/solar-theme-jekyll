		<h1><a href="http://hyperlinked.co/2012/11/first-look-crucial-upgrade-advisor/">First Look: Crucial Upgrade Advisor</a></h1>
	

	<div class="post-content"><p>Most other memory store where you can buy online call the tools they offer to help you configure your PC with more memory memory finders, memory tools or even memory configurators, but only <a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-1548159-10273954"><strong>Crucial calls theirs an ‘upgrade advisor’.</strong></a> I guess it is but you’re not asking the website what ram you use and it spits back an answer. Nope, you have to tell it all the specifics of your PC and then wait for it to match the specs with the RAM.</p>

<p>Also, if you forgo the memory advisor from Crucial you can find your ram numerous ways and one way is to visit Crucial and then select memory&gt;shop by manufacturer and select your manufacturer you will see that the best upgrades for Apple are for much older computers. I mean really? when was the last time you thought about upgrading your PowerBook G4? The ram would cost as much as you can buy the notebook on eBay. This is a missed opportunity if you ask me. I think it would do Crucial much better to promote more modern Apple memory like the new 2012 MacBook Pro’s or iMacs – memory that people are wanting to buy.</p>

<p>Quibbles aside: If you use the Crucial Upgrade Advisor you get one thing that might just trump all – and that’s a guarantee that the RAM you will buy will work – or you get to send it back for a refund (or an exchange). This is actually a great marketing scheme if you think about it: You do all the work by entering all your data (which you have to do anyway to figure out your memory) and then Crucial’s advisor spits out the RAM (and BTW tends to list the largest ram first – at least they got that right) and guarantees it will work.</p>

<p>Other stores guarantee their RAM but save for a badge or something on the bottom of their sites’ homepage their warranty isn’t something that’s promoted much, and in this area alone Crucial’s got them beat. They promote the warranty that comes with the advisor which I am sure sells more memory and yet lowers support costs. First, you enter the data so as long as you enter the right info there’s no way the advisor can mess up. A lot of computers use the exact same part so they’re just selling you the same ram regardless of PC model. And because you used the advisor from Crucial instead of just guessing there’s less chance of returns. In effect their guarantee costs very little to offer because they know the ram will work and it’s tested name brand memory. There will be very few problems when handled correctly and Crucial knows this.</p>

<p>The Crucial Upgrade Advisor is a good deal for both customers and Crucial alike. It keeps support costs low and the you know you will get the right ram for your Mac or PC, <a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-1548159-10273954"><strong>guaranteed</strong></a>.</p>
