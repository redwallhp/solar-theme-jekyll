		<h1><a href="/2012/06/hrt-music-streamer-ii-usb-dac-digital-audio-converter-review/">HRT Music Streamer II USB DAC (Digital Audio Converter) Review</a></h1>
	

	<div class="post-content"><p>I had originally sent an email to High Resolution Technologies for a review sample of this model, and although the president of HRT got back to me, I was to hear from the US distributor of this audio component and I never did hear back and I really wanted to review this product  so I just bought the DAC myself.  I find it mightt just be easier to do it this way than to worry about return dates and shipping costs, especially for inexpensive products like the <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0038O4UFQ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0038O4UFQ">HRT Music Streamer II</a></strong></p>

<p><a href="cheapest HRT music streamer"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4778" title="HRT1" alt="" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/HRT1.png" width="630" height="341" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Size and Weight</strong></p>

<p><em>**</em>One of the very first thing I noticed was the size and weight of the HRT Music Streamer II, and it was much smaller in size than I had anticipated by the online photos I had seen. The actual dimensions of the DAC from High resolution technologies are not much bigger than the photo above, at just  a tad over 5 inches long and 2 inches wide and one inch tall , this is one of the smaller audio components I own.</p>

<p><strong>Connections</strong></p>

<p>The output side of the HRT Music Streamer II  is all about the business of connecting the DAC to your  Amplifier or Home Audio reciever, or any other device that offers line in inputs.  Connect some analog interconnects to this and your stereo and you are off to the races.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/HRT2.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4780" title="HRT music streamer II analog out. " alt="" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/HRT2.png" width="630" height="422" /></a><br />
The business end of the HRT Music Streamer II is where the rubber hits the road and allows you to connect the DAC to your computer.  This allows you to do one very important thing and that is to bypass the sound card of  your PC (in my case, a cheap acer netbook) and use the HRT Music Streamer II  to process the digital sound coming out of your computer. The dedicated DAC will sound much better than the sound card installed in your PC as an afterthought.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/HRT3.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4781" title="HRT3" alt="" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/HRT3.png" width="630" height="330" /></a></p>

<p>The Asynchronous USB connection is what you really need to pay attention to, as it’s my understanding that this feature allows for the DAC to dictate the speed and control of the data as it processes it in real time. This results in less errors or audio ‘jitter’ I am led to understand because with this feature the DAC has control of the speed and not the PC.</p>

<p>Also on this end are the different digital sampling rates up to 96k, yet for my use I just want better sound from my CD collection I ripped to ALAC format and just want to have bitperfect output at 16/44.1 so I did not try all the other sampling rates for this review, but the DAC instantly locked on to the redbook CD output signal and had the display change to light up the 44k1 LED. It just worked, right out of the box without having to worry about PC drivers or other issues</p>

<p><strong>How does the HRT Music Streamer Sound? </strong></p>

<p>I am just an audio enthusiast looking to get the best sound affordably from my system, I want my speakers to be the most expensive component and this is why I was attracted to the HRT Music Streamer II. I am not looking to be the expert audiophile by any stretch. We just like to listen to music and the sound from the notebook from the PC was far from perfect. With the HRT Music Streamer II the first indicator of how good this product is is that my wife noticed and appreciated the difference in sound with the DAC installed.</p>

<p>I found that for the price this is a welcome addition to our home stereo. Due to system placement issues the system is tucked into a corner and the speakers are too close together for my liking and listening position.  Without the DAC, the system lacked imaging but with the HRT Music Streamer II integrated I found much more stereo imaging and placement of the musical instruments than before.</p>

<p>The bottom line is we are pleased with our purchase as it improved the sound of our home stereo system greatly and affordably, allowing us to replace the CD player with a cheap digital music server and DAC solution. The entire cost for both PC and DAC was well under $400. You don’t need to buy an expensive music server to get great sound. A Mac Mini or cheap notebook will serve very nicely as an excellent music server and storage device.</p>

<p><strong>Features and Benefits of the HRT Music Streamer II<br />
**<br />
**USB Powered</strong>. This means that you don’t need any ugly wall warts or power adapters to use this DAC and this is important if you’re planning to use the music streamer in a living area where you don’t want unsightly cables. This also is pretty energy efficient because all your power needs are served by your PC.</p>

<p><strong>Size and Weight</strong> – This unit is small and will not take up any rack or shelving space. You could easily hide the HRT music streamer behind an amplifier or even place the DAC on top</p>

<p><strong>Ease of Use.</strong> This truly is a plug and play device.</p>

<p><strong>Asynchronous USB</strong>. The DAC dictates the transfer rate for better sound.</p>

<p><strong>24/96 Sample Rate and Bit Depth.</strong> High Resolution Audio never sounded so good</p>

<p><strong>Mac and PC compatible.</strong> Use iTunes or Windows Media Player for playback of your audio.</p>

<p>**Summary: ** For a little over $100 this is an affordable DAC that sounds really great for the price. Considering you can spend this much on cables to connect the DAC to your amplifier, the fact that you get an actual audio component for the same price might be the best audio bargain of this year. I do wish the DAC were more in the design of standard audio component either full sized or half sized but the small size does make this easy to tuck behind a more standard stereo component.</p>

<p><strong>Where to Buy the HRT Music Streamer II.</strong> I <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0038O4UFQ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0038O4UFQ">bought mine at Amazon</a></strong> and I ask you to consider the same if you enjoyed this digital review. Prices tend to be the lowest not just for the HRT Music Streamer II but every other audio component too such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00415A3XY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00415A3XY">USB cables</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003USZS8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ramseeker-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B003USZS8I">audio interconnects</a> you will need to buy as well to get the best sound out of the HRT Music Streamer II and this will sound much better for say, MacBook Pro Audio via the USB port than if you were to   use the regular headphone output  on the Apple notebook.</p>
