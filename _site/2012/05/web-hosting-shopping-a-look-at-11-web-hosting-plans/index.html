	<div class="post-content"><p>There was a time when I didn’t really care about web hosting and happily paid three thousand dollars a year or more for a dedicated web server to host this site (and others), but as the demand for RAM has leveled off and the ram prices have dropped, I am starting to look for ways to save money on my annual web hosting bill.</p>

<p>**I’m with <a href="http://www.pair.com">Pair</a>. **</p>

<p>A few years back, I switched platforms to use wordpress instead of my ever so more complicated html setup. I’ve had a few complaints about tracking the ram prices for the older macs, but my research shows you folks are not looking for ram for older Macs so I now just concentrate on the newer Apple computer models as those are the Macs people are buying and need to upgrade the RAM on. I can speak from personal experience that the only time I have ever bought RAM is when I needed to upgrade the RAM on a brand new Mac – most recently being an Apple Mac Mini I upgraded with 8gb of RAM.</p>

<p>Anyway, back to the web hosting: In an effort to cut costs I transferred this site to shared hosting and except for the odd burp in service, I don’t really have any complaint with them except for the fact that for shared hosting – at $85.00 a month they’re kind of pricey when I compare other web hosting packages available online.</p>

<p>This will, I think be the first in a series of web hosting plan comparisons I hope to do as I can’t help myself – I like to shop and get the best price on stuff, whether it’s web hosting or memory upgrades and 1&amp;1 web hosting is the first host I found alphabetically so I’ll start there:</p>

<p><strong>1&amp;1 Web Hosting Plans</strong></p>

<p>The good folks at 1&amp;1 offer a few plans but the best web hosting from 11 web hosting costs just a little over 3 bucks a month. Even with the 25% discount I got from Pair networks that’s still a significant savings over the $80 a month I am paying now for web hosting. a</p>

<p>I really don’t need a lot for my web hosting needs, as this is just a blog and I bet that any old host would work for my site and traffic load. I would need some mysql databases for the wordpress databases and unlimited traffic and storage space that this cheap web hosting plan from 11 web hosting offers.</p>

<p>I don’t care less about free domain names, email accounts, ssl certificates and or dual hosting. I may be inclined to upgrade the hostin to their business web hosting as opposed to their personal plan, only for the fact that the performance may be better and I think the faster ramseeker is the better.</p>

<p>I can always pay more for web hosting later too, as I have yet to find any business that will not take more money than you are currently paying.</p>
