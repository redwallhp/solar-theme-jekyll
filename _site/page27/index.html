<br>

		<div class="post-content">I spent $22.00 on my Dell Music Server to be exact.

<img class=" wp-image-4253 " title="Cheap Music Server" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/JIM_3337-1024x680.jpg" alt="Dell Music Server" width="450" />

Over the years one might say my CD collection has grown some. I&#8217;m closing in on 1000 CD&#8217;s in my collection and I have a problem: My wife doesn&#8217;t like the space it takes. Thus my search began on how to manage my CD collection and at the same time be able to access all my music easily without the bulk and space requirements of a physical CD collection taking up space in our main living area, so my search began for a cheap music server to eventually replace my CD&#8217;s and CD Player.

**I really want to Buy a Mac Mini ** But like a lot of other folks, money is tight and **[spending almost $600 on a Mac Mini][1]** really isn&#8217;t in the cards for now as there&#8217;s home repairs and other stuff like the mortgage that currently keeps our fiscal attention so for the time being, the Mac Mini has to wait. Paired with an iPhone or iPad this really could be the best way to manage your music for under $1000 **** **But what if I could make a cheap music server for a fraction of that cost? ** [<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-4255" title="JIM_3341" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/JIM_3341-1024x680.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="" />][2] *I did have to [add more memory][3] to get my cheapo dell up and running * A bit of searching led me to [vortexbox.org][4] and this is music server software that&#8217;s linux based and offers a free and easy way to make a music server out of pretty much any old PC you&#8217;ve got kicking around.  I could build a PC for this purpose  but by the time you&#8217;ve got the PC built you&#8217;re over $300 or more into it  and by that point I&#8217;d rather save my pennies and buy what I really want &#8211; a Mac Mini. (This might be a good topic to explore further though)

[<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4271" title="VortexBox GUI Interface" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Screen-Shot-2012-04-30-at-7.43.48-PM-600x648.png" alt="" width="600" height="648" />][4]

&nbsp;

*The web user interface on the vortexbo*

**So I searched eBay for some cheap desktop computers and found a [Dell Optiplex 280 on ebay][5] that&#8217;s obviously been put to use in an office environment but is now off lease. It&#8217;s an older Intel P4 processor running  at 2.8GHz but it came with a fresh install of Windows XP, and 512mb of RAM and a 40GB hard drive &#8211; enough power to allow me to test the vortexbox software and see if it&#8217;s for me and whether I should invest in a faster PC in the future to use as a dedicated music server. As this is really just a hobby, I didn&#8217;t want to spend a whole lot of money on a music server just for a PC to test software with and this little $22 wonder got me off the ground to test. I did underestimate the ram requirements of the Vortexbox and had to find another 512mb of DDR2 to get the minimum 1GB of RAM required as the Dell only shipped with 512mb  of RAM and I needed 1GB  of RAM  to get this box up and running.

**The Beauty of Vortex Box**

You do have to be a bit of technical soul to work your way around vortexbox if you need to add more programs and change some settings  and  you may even have to work with a command line, but I found it relatively easy to do and have been able to get the media server online and I can play my music with Itunes with ease, which was the entire point. Once you have the vortexbox set up who cares if you only spent $20?

**Set It, and Forget It**   [<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-4254" title="Rip a CD with ease" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/JIM_3338-1024x680.jpg" alt="It's easy to RIP a CD with vortexbox" width="600" height="" />][6] Simplicity  is why a Mac Mini is so attractive to me as I want to be able to replace my CD Player &#8211; a Rega Planet &#8211;   and have all my music in one place.  Once I change a few settings on the Mac Mini I can run the server headless and the Mac Mini is a wife-approved form factor in the living room that&#8217;s quiet. **This is an important factor that must not be overlooked**. But the [Vortex Box is a cheaper music server by far,][7] and once you get the server software installed on your PC you can run the music server anywhere there&#8217;s a network and power as all the management of the vortexbox is run through the easy to use web interface that you can access from any  PC or even a tablet with  a web browser. The best part about a music server is that it&#8217;s hidden from view and yet you can still access all your music and  the convenience far outweighs using storing and caring for a CD collection. In the case of the Dell this  was really just to play with rather than really use as a music server but the software did run on this old P4 computer with just 1GB of RAM, but save for the fact that it&#8217;s a slow computer to work with, once I had it setup as a music server I noticed no difference between using this computer due to a quad core PC. Thankfully, you really don&#8217;t need a lot of processing power to play music. If I tweaked the server, I could have done two things had I really wanted to use this Dell as my one and only music server:

I could have [bought a bigger hard drive][8] to toss inside the Dell. I would use at least a 1TB drive, perhaps even a 2TB hard drive as the cost for the bigger drive isn&#8217;t that much more in price. Or &#8211; and this is the cheaper option. I have a 500GB external drive that would be put to use as  as an external source for my music. The hard drive doesn&#8217;t have to be inside the PC. You do have to configure the vortexbox installation to use an external drive for storage instead, but it is possible and this would be the cheaper option too as I already have the hard drive and it&#8217;s bought and  paid for. The best part of using the vortexbox is that you don&#8217;t have to touch the server once you have it configured. You can copy all your music to the external drive and hook it up and you&#8217;re done. I found no connection or other issues. The vortexbox served and played my music.

**Ease of Use** But if your music is still on CD&#8217;s the Dell music server really shines as all you have to do to get the music onto your music server is to open the CD player, toss in a CD and shut the door. The PC does all the rest from getting the cover art to ripping the CD in flac format. When all the songs on the CD have been imported the drawer opens and you remove the CD and install another. Rinse, Lather, Repeat. As a test I tried to rip Van Morrison&#8217;s Best Of and the rip went fine but it did take a while &#8211; about 15 minutes. I think this speed could be increased with a faster processor. This is an older computer. But, if you&#8217;ve got the time, an old PC and enough storage there&#8217;s no reason why you couldn&#8217;t use your old PC as a music server with this free music server software   [<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-4256" title="JIM_3347" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/JIM_3347-1024x680.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="" />][9] **Buy a new vortexbox. ** If the thought of working and waiting for an old PC sends shivers down your spine you can take the easy way out and buy your own brand new vortexbox with a modern processor and the software installed and pre configured already:



&nbsp;

This modern music server uses the exact same software as on my $20 dell, but it&#8217;s wrapped in a faster processor and is ready to go out of the box. The cheap Dell does take some tweaking to get going, but once it&#8217;s running as you like you really don&#8217;t have to touch it I found. **Summary. ** For  the money  I spent on the Dell Music Server I&#8217;m quite happy. You do have to be a bit more of a propellor  head  and you many even have to dip into the command line  to get things set the way you like but once you do , I  found  the vortexbox to be easy to use as both an iTunes ana DLNA server. **Pros**. cheap cheap cheap. and runs on almost any old PC. **Cons**. Would take some tweaking  to get my entire CD collection on, and at 15 minutes to RIP this might take a while.  Also, the fan is noisy on this PC. You can use it as a server, but not  a player in the same room.  There are other quieter PC&#8217;s out there

<br>

		<div class="post-content">This particular **Mac Pro from Apple **uses 240 pin sdram dimms and you don&#8217;t have to worry about  lack of memory slots with this Apple Mac Pro model  as there&#8217;s four banks of memory upgrade slots, and each memory bank contains two different memory upgrade slots on each bank, for a total of eight slots you can install memory for this Apple Mac Pro. From the Factory the **Mac Pro Dual Core 2.0 GHz **shipped with just 1GB of memory, which is almost pitiful in these times but you can do much better with the memory upgrades and max this Mac Pro Model out to 32gb of RAM.

**Where to Buy Memory for Apple Mac Pro Dual Core 2.0 GHz**

First,  I need to  tell you that vendors of memory upgrades for the Mac Pro&#8217;s list both memory upgrade kits and memory upgrade modules for the Mac Pro Dual Core 2.0 GHz.   As memory must be installed in matched pairs, or memory upgrade kit with this particular Mac Pro model, some vendors have chosen to sell and market the memory for this Mac Pro model in memory ugrade kits. This allows the customer to buy a matched pair of memory upgrades and know they don&#8217;t need anything else.

But, (and there&#8217; always a but..) some vendors have chosen to stick to listing the memory upgrades for this Mac Pro in just single modules and will assume that the customer is wise enough to buy memory in matched pairs. It&#8217;s my opinion that this is a mistake as well..why make it harder than it needs to be to buy ram for your Mac Pro?

Anyway, I here are [ **memory modules for the Mac Pro**][1]

With this info you can make  an educated decision when buying memory upgrades for your Apple Mac Pro 2.0GHz

here&#8217;s not a day goes by where I&#8217;m not asked the question:

**What kind of RAM do I need? What RAM and Memory Upgrades Should I Buy?**

<strong style="line-height: 18px;"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8H8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=ramseeker-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B002QQ8H8I">Apple MacBook Pro. Best Selling NoteBook Today</a></strong>

<img class="size-full wp-image-1484 alignleft" title="Best Selling Notebook" alt="Best laptop" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Screen-shot-2011-03-26-at-2.24.37-PM.png" width="300" height="242" />Well, that depends. On the PC side of the memory equation you usually have more options and it&#8217;s easier to** find out what kind of memory you need for your computer** as the manufacturer and models names for the desktop and notebook computers are distinct for each computer manufacturer and model.

For example, If you  are looking to** upgrade your del**l, and you have a **dell notebook** you need memory upgrades for all you usually have to do is find out what model number that is and you&#8217;re usually off to the races. For an example: **You need memory for your brand new Dell inspiron 14  or Inspiron 15 or even inspiron 17 models with core i3 and core i5 processors **that are **current notebook models from Dell**, but would perform much better if you just **added more memory.** (as adding memory to most computers will offer: more ram equals faster software)

Right, so you&#8217;ve got the model name from Dell:  So you find any[**memory store** ][1]that you choose and each of these stores will offer a **memory configurator **where you just plunk in your manufacturer and model name of your** desktop or notebook **and you&#8217;re returned with a list of **memory & ram upgrades** that match your computer.

Sounds Easy, Right? And it is: For this example, I&#8217;ll use[**Crucial Technology**][2]**,** but you could pick from any **vendor of memory** I list on [ramseeker][3] as they all carry easy to use** memory configurators that will help you choose the right memory** and ram upgrades.

But for this example, I&#8217;ll use[ Crucial Technology][2]: So I find my manufacturer: Which is in this case, Dell. And then I&#8217;ll choose **Inspiron laptops/notebooks,** and then lastly I find my model, for this example I will use Dell Inspiron 15 and I see theres&#8217;s two choices: One is just Dell inspiron 15, and the other  is **dell inspiron 1564**, The **dell inspiron 15** seems  to list a  little older types of memory  and I&#8217;m going go guess that the** dell inspiron 15 (1564) **is the better choice for me as this model listing at crucial specifies** DDR3 PC1066 memory modules **which is the more recent of the two listings and also a quick reference of the dell website specifies that the **dell inspiron 15  that&#8217;s currently offered does require the DD3 PC-8500 memory modules**.

And that&#8217;s it.  A bit of research, and I&#8217;ve got a **new ram and memory upgrade ordered for my Dell Inspiron 15 notebook** computer.

   <B> <h1><a href="/2011/12/how-much-memory-do-i-need-to-run-itunes/">How Much Memory Do I Need To Run iTunes?</a></h1></B>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content">Apple iTunes is in my opinion, the best Apple software for the Mac and the best part is that it&#8217;s included in each and every  Mac you buy

But, over the years iTunes has grown in size to the point where it allows you to buy new music, buy  new videos and TV shows and more at the iTunes store. All this takes more and more processing power over time to the point where if you don&#8217;t have a relatively new Apple computer you may not be able to run the current Generations of iTunes at all.

**Apple iTunes Requirements **

For the Mac, you need at least 512 mb of RAM and either a G4, G5 or Intel Mac for the Application to run. If you have the need to play standard definition video, the requirements rise to at least a 1Ghz G4 and still jus 512mb of RAM.

High Definition Video is where the ram and processor requirements for Apple iTunes really dial up: For 720p high definition video the minimum possible is a 2.0 Ghz Intel Core 2 Duo processor, with twice the  amount  of RAM at 1GB. And if you want full 1080p high definition, the bar gets raised higher at 2.4Ghz Intel Core Duo and 2GB of RAM.

So, if  you&#8217;re just playing music, it seems you can get away with an [older Mac][1], but if you want to use HD video you&#8217;ll need a newer Mac ([from about 2008 and up][2]).

Depending on the speed and RAM on your current computer, you might be able to upgrade the RAM or you may have to buy a brand new Mac to get full HD. The Apple Mac Mini is my favorite Mac for iTunes use as it&#8217;s small, quiet and one of the **[cheapest Mac computers you can buy][3]**.

I wonder, is this the end of the Apple iMac?  I hope not, as the Apple iMac is one of the best selling desktop computers in the past from Apple, but with the release of the iPad, new MacBook Pro&#8217;s rumored to be released soon, and the fact that lightweight ultrabooks and even smartphones are more popular than ever before I wonder how, and more importantly when Apple will release new Apple iMac computers in 2012?

<img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3877" title="Cheap iMac 27 inch " src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/imac-27-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" />

The current**[ 2011 Apple iMac models][1]** saw a release date back in May, meaning as we enter a new year, the once new iMac isn&#8217;t so high tech anymore and I am hoping for the 2012 iMac to  be released with the following features:

1. **Touch Screen iMac** . The iPad has touch input, and so does the iPhone, so  why not the 2012 iMac?  I wonder how much  of a feature this would be used on a desktop computer? Would it be beneficial to be able to use a touch screen iMac for the everyman? (and woman). One thing I think that would be beneficial for a touch screen iMac would be for shopping and scrolling, and I bet the graphics community would love to be able to use a finger instead of a mouse.

2. **More Memory**. The ram on the iMac for 2011 is already at a respectable 16GB, but I predict that by the end of the yea 16GB for iMac willl be the norm, and  32GB would allow for future expandability.

3. **Faster Processors**. The iMac could replace the Mac Pro entirely if the processor speed, ram and hard drive specifications would increase. We haven&#8217;t seen a Mac Pro update in ages and in fact, it&#8217;s been so long that I wonder is there will be a brand new Mac Pro at all or will Apple rely on the Pro notebook lineup for all their professional customers.

4. **Flatter screen.** If Apple can make a notebook that only weighs a few pounds, surely they can make the iMac better looking. It&#8217;s still a pretty thin machine, but the current iMac design needs  a refresh.

**5. Bigger Screen **This is another possibility.  With LED prices continuosly dropping, it would make perfect sense for a 32 inch iMac that doubles as a TV. and offers built in TV capabilities &#8211;  something like Google TV where you could  use the iMac as your media center, and not just the hub.

**When  will the 2012 Apple iMac Release Date Be?**

The  last time we saw a completely new iMac design is last May, and I can&#8217;t expect that we will see a new Apple iMac before May 2012. There&#8217;s a very good chance for a brand new MacBook Pro  to be released in 2012. Then  there&#8217;s the iPad and early spring tends to be the time for iPad releases. The iPhone has historically been released in the summertime and then we&#8217;re into the fall for iPod releases or other surprises from Apple for the holiday shopping season. This leaves **May 2012 to be a very good chance to see a new iMac release in 2012 **and would be one year from the release of the 2011 Apple iMac. &#8211; a good time to replace the 2011 Apple iMac with a newer 2012 iMac.

Even though the [MacBook has been discontinued][1] for over a few months now, the MacBook tradition still continues in the **[MacBook Air and MacBook Pro in 2012][2]** and as these notebooks become more and more popular over time, one area I have paid more attention to in recent times is to make sure I  have the most ergonomic and comfortable desktop or workspace I can, and one way to do this is to prop up your MacBook with a MacBook Stand.

There&#8217;s two schools of thought when it comes to buying a MacBook stand. One is to get the MacBook out of the way  and use the processor only. Using a mac notebook as a desktop replacement can be not  the most effective method to  use your desktop space and I find that the space behind your MacBook ends up being a no mans land for hard drives and other junk. But, if you buy a MacBook stand, you can prop up your MacBook and connect it to an external mouse and keyboard (USB, or bluetooth) and monitor and  have much more desktop space.

## **Closed MacBook Stand**

The**[ Twelve South MacBook Stand ][3]**is just one example of this:

[<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3898" title="best macbook stand" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/macbookstand1.jpg" alt="cheap macbook stand" width="300" height="300" />][3]

&nbsp;

This is one of the better looking stands for your MacBook Pro and yet still offers full access to all the external ports you may need to access for monitor, USB, etc.

The downside of this design of stand for MacBook is that although it gets your MacBook Pro out of the way,  you lose the screen real estate of the MacBook Pro. Heck, you may as well buy a Mac Mini and save over a thousand  dollars if this is where your MacBook Pro will reside most of the time.

The advantage of this MacBook stand is obvious from the photo though, as it get your MacBook out of the way and frees up a whole lot of desktop for your monitor, or files an folders or even a coffee.

Another advantage using a MacBook Stand is that whatever style of stand you end up buying, these things prop up your MacBook and reduce the diet coke effect where you spill on your brand new MacBook Pro, which is a very expensive lesson to learn, but with a stand, your fancy Apple notebook is saved from splils.

## **Elevated MacBook Stand **

**[<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3902" title="Elevated MacBook Stand" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/macbookstand2.jpg" alt="Griffin MacBook Stand" width="300" height="300" />][4]**

This is the cheaper MacBook Stand of the two designs, and the **[Griffin Elevated Macook Stand][4]**  comes in on sale at about half the price of the twelve south unit above.

The advantage of the elevated design of this stand is that you can still use your monitor if you so choose. You could still use this elevated stand and keep your MacBook closed too if you prefer.

But the whole point of this stand is  to get your MacBook screen at a more elevated angle to reduce neck strain. In most cases, notebook design is lacking  and  will leave the notebook  user looking down on the notebook screen, which over time can become uncomfortable.

The disadvantage of the Griffin stand, and  other elevators is that you are limited to the height of the stand, and whether it&#8217;s just personal preference or that you have a taller or shorter desk or seating arrangement, is that despite your best efforts your MacBook just may not be at the level  you desire. if the stand is too low, you can still prop up your MacBook stand with  a few books or something but if the elevated stand is too high, I found the only solution with this type of stand is to remove it all together.

## **The Best and Cheapest MacBook Stand **

These are becoming harder and harder to find as the digital age evolves, but I have found  that propping your Macbook up on a phonebook or two is one of the better way to elevate your MacBook to the best  level for your needs  and the best part is that phonebooks are free. If you use phonebooks from different cities, you can tweak your tower or books to get  a custom stand for your MacBook without the added expense of buying a custom MacBook Stand

One of the benefits of Apple computers, is that despite their high price when compared to comparable PC&#8217;s from HP or some other manufacturer running windows is that they hold their value and if you shop on eBay or craigslist you may be able to buy a [cheap used Mac][5].

And  I know, that in my experiences shopping online that most times the seller of  the older Mac just wants to get some money for their old Mac and replace it with a newer model or perhaps they need the cash for something else, and a lot of times they state that there&#8217;s warranty on the Apple computer left, **but how do you know for sure**?

**Get an Apple Warranty Check**

One reason i prefer Apple over other PC brands, is that despite the high price that the  Apple products demand, Apple offers some of the best support in the computer industry and one example is this:

To check if the Apple computer you already own or are considering buying is in warranty  is to[ go to Apple and check][6],

All you need to do this is the serial number of the computer and the country you are in and Apple will return to you a custom report on the status of the Apple computer you are considering buying. When you have this info you will be abl to tell if the seller of your possible Apple purchase is on the up and up, and  even if your possible Mac is  out of warranty, you will be able to see what your options are when it comes to either getting the Mac repaired.

A two second visit to the Apple support page could save you possible problems with your used Mac purchase down the road.

   <B> <h1><a href="/2011/12/i-wish-there-was-iphoto-for-windows/">I Wish There Was iPhoto for Windows</a></h1></B>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content">Due to the fact that ram prices are not what they once  were I have had to cut costs in 2011. In December 2010 8GB of RAM would cost you just under $100, but now you can buy 8GB of RAM for close to $30.00.  As you can imagine, the profits on $34.00 are much less than a hundred bucks. One reason for this decrease in ram prices over 2011 have been that demand for RAM has been less as most laptops and tablets come from the factory with enough RAM already installled.

What does this have to do with wishing there was iPhoto for Windows 7?  I had to sell my much loved MacBook Pro and buy a much cheaper windows 7 notebook to work on this site as the earnings have dwindled over the years considerably.

**Windows Alternatives to iPhoto. **

I have only been working on the PC exclusively for a few weeks now, but one piece of software I miss is iPhoto. Even though I have a background in photography, I always loved the ease of use in managing my photos that iPhoto offered. I know, there were other software for Mac I could have used, like lightroom or Aperture, but for just importing my photos, a quick cleanup of sharpness and brightness and then  lately, sharing my photos on facebook.

**Help, I&#8217;ve got  Windows 7.  **

Windows 7 actually does a pretty good job of  importing my pics and gives me quick access and  an easy to browse directory of photos and allows me to flag my keepers &#8211; one feature I really miss the most with iPhoto.

So, for now my photos are just in my photograph folder on my PC, but I thinking of either working with social networks for photography &#8211; either flickr, or picassa by Google. I have been a flickr user in the past, but as Google continues to grow  I  find I like to  consolidate my work using Google apps such as Google Docs or Google mail, I wonder if using Picassa for Windows might be the best way to keep track of my photos as (like Flikr)  I could work in the cloud with not only my documents but my photos too

This is where I miss using my MacBook Pro the most and that&#8217;s using iPhoto  to work with my pictures. I have been a Mac user for so long, that any new software for editing photos on Microsoft Windows 7 feels like  it&#8217;s such a learning curve and I just wish that  Apple released  iPhoto for Windows like they do with iTunes for Windows or Safari for Windows.

[<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3882" title="imac 27 inch mac background" src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/imac27.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" />][1]

I&#8217;ve never really cared about backgounds for Mac computer much when I was a long time Mac user as my computing style is this: h**ave as many windows open as possible at once so you can&#8217;t even see the background**. it helps if you have a lot of ram installed to keep all these windows open.

If I were to change the background  on my Mac it would be to just a simple background like am 18 percent grey. This would allow me to work in Photoshop without  having to worry about the background messing  with me when I was photo editing. I was never a big customizer when it cames to my Mac. I would buy a new Mac notebook every year or so and then get to work.  I wouldn&#8217;t  even bother buying Applecare because I have written, it&#8217;s just a waste of money. I prefer to self insure my  Apple computers after the first year.

**Mac Backgrounds That Look Great  **

There&#8217;s lots of  great looking free backgrounds ready for download though, or you could even stick with the stock one from Lion, Apple&#8217;s latest operating system. In recent years this is all I  have done. But this is just one guy&#8217;s opinion when it comes to personalizing your Mac and I&#8217;m not the be all and end all when it comes to customizing your Mac to your specific taste. Here&#8217;s a few of the better places to start  looking for Mac backgrounds that look great.

Mac AppStorm shows us [50 Mac Desktops for Maximum Visual Goodness][2] and according to them it can be a &#8216;fantastica motivator&#8217;.

If the 50 weren&#8217;t good enough for you they also offer [another 160][3] great looking Mac backgrounds for you to peruse. That should keep you busy for a while. <img src="http://www.ramseeker.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

Apple Wallpapers offers, well.. [Apple Wallpapers][4]

Desktop Nexus will reinvent  your desktop with [these backgrounds for the Mac][5].

These are just a few of the best places to start your search for   Mac backgrounds available for download today. (free, in most cases too)
