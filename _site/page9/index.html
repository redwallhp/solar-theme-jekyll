<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>The MacBook Pro 13” 2.9GHz dual-core Intel Core i7 can accept up to 16gb of RAM and both spinning hard drives as well much faster SSD drives for increased performance.</p>

<p><strong>RAM for MacBook Pro 13” 2.9GHz dual-core Intel Core i7</strong></p>

<p>This model of MacBook Pro can accept up to 16gb of RAM thanks to the 2 memory slots availabe. 16gb of RAM for this MacBook pro model is super cheap at about $50.00 for a 16gb kit. (<a href="http://amzn.to/1ONw3dI"><strong>check price</strong></a>)</p>

<p>If don’t want to upgrade the MacBook pro to 16gb, there’s always an 8gb option that will only cost you about thirty dollars (<a href="http://amzn.to/1ONw3dI"><strong>check price</strong></a>) but I suggest that if you’re going to to to the bother of upgrading the RAM on this MacBook Pro model that you do it right and just get all the ram installed that is allowed.</p>

<p><strong>*Spinning (traditional) hard drives for MacBook Pro 13” 2.9GHz dual-core Intel Core i7</strong></p>

<p>I don’t really recommend upgrading to a traditional hard drive on your MacBook Pro unless you really need to carry a lot of files with you at all times and need the storage space.</p>

<p>The benefits of traditional hard drives vs SSD drives is that the cost per gb is a lot lower when you compard prices of SSD vs HDD in the same capacity.</p>

<p>If you do prefer to buy a traditional hard drive for the MacBook Pro here’s a few suggestions:</p>

<p><a href="http://amzn.to/1UfojFL">Samsung Seagate 2TB Laptop HDD SATA III 2.5-Inch Internal Bare Drive</a></p>

<p><a href="http://amzn.to/1TLudiY">Seagate Laptop Thin 500 GB 7200RPM SATA 6 GB/s 32 MB Cache 2.5 Inch Hard Disk Drive</a></p>

<p><a href="http://amzn.to/1OP9IML">Samsung Momentus 4TB SATA III 5400 RPM 2.5-inch Hard Drive</a></p>

<h2 id="ssd-drives-for-macbook-pro-13-29ghz-dual-core-intel-core-i7">SSD Drives for MacBook Pro 13” 2.9GHz dual-core Intel Core i7</h2>

<p>SSD drives a much better choice for upgrading the hard drive on any computer. The main advantage is speed as there are no moving parts to slow down the read and write process so apps open quikly and your entire computer will feel more responsive.</p>

<p>The disadvantage of SSDs vs hard drives is cost. SSD drives are more expensive per gigabyte than traditional drives but prices continue to drop so more and more can afford a SSD upgrade for Macbook pro.</p>

<p>A few suggstions for SSD Drives for MacBook Pro:</p>

<p><a href="http://amzn.to/1WPCi8G">Samsung 850 EVO 250GB 2.5-Inch SATA III Internal SSD</a></p>

		<div class="post-content"><p>The MacBook Pro 13” 2.5GHz dual-core Intel Core i5  is one of the  last 
models to actually accept a memory upgrade as later models after 2013 only allowed you to configure memory upgrades  at the time of purchase,</p>

<h3 id="memory-upgrade-options">Memory Upgrade Options</h3>

<p>This model of MacBook Pro has 2 memory slots and can be upgraded to either 8GB or 16GB:</p>

<p><a href="http://amzn.to/1Ow9PCe">8GB MacBook Pro Memory</a></p>

<p><a href="http://amzn.to/1Ow9P4Z">16GB MacBook Pro Memory</a></p>

<p>At time of writing you can <a href="http://amzn.to/1Ow9P4Z">buy 16GB of RAM</a>  for this Apple MacBook Pro model for about  $50.00</p>

<h3 id="ssd-upgrade-options">SSD Upgrade Options</h3>

<p>SSD Drives have <a href="http://amzn.to/1XuumsQ">really dropped in price</a> with 250GB SSD prices under $100.00</p>

<p>with a few larger sizes available as well:</p>

<p><a href="http://amzn.to/1TgJfcR">500GB ssd drives</a> for about $150.00</p>

<p><a href="http://amzn.to/1TgJfcR">1TB  ssd drives</a> for about  $325.00</p>

<p><a href="http://amzn.to/1TjD9uu">2TB  ssd drives</a> for about $850.00</p>

<h3 id="traditional-hard-drive-upgrade-options">Traditional Hard Drive Upgrade Options</h3>

<p>If the prices on the SSD drives  are still too much money you can always upgrade  with  a traditional 2.5 inch spinning hard drive with <a href="http://amzn.to/1VYyCBg">1TB hard drive prices</a> costing about $50.00 and then go up from there.</p>

<p>Your best bet is to follow the instructions on how to upgrade this model <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/index?page=search&amp;type=organic&amp;src=support_searchbox_main&amp;locale=en_US&amp;q=MacBook%20Pro%2013%22%202.5GHz%20dual-core%20Intel%20Core%20i5#query=MacBook%20Pro%2013%22%202.5GHz%20dual-core%20Intel%20Core%20i5%20ram%20upgrade&amp;product=&amp;doctype=&amp;currentPage=1&amp;includeArchived=false">directly from Apple’s support page</a></p>

<p>RAM and an SSD upgrade can be had for $150.00 for a 240GB SSD and 16GB of RAM and these two upgrades can breathe new life into an older Mac.</p>

    <h1><a href="/2016/05/05/out-of-memory/">Out of Memory</a></h1>
		

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>I knew this day would come eventually.</p>

<p><strong>I no longer compare memory upgrade prices</strong> for apple computers.</p>

<p>This is due to a few reasons:</p>

<p>RAM is cheap - real cheap and you can get all the ram you will ever really need for about <a href="http://amzn.to/1Uu2fZP">fifty bucks</a> so it’s not priced like it once was where you could spend hundreds if not thousands of dollars on memory upgrades.</p>

<p>It’s getting harder and harder to upgrade the ram on an Apple computer. If you
want to upgrade a current Mac Mini, MacBook, MacBook Pro or iMac (some)? <strong>You can’t</strong>.</p>

<p>RAM  on these machines are soldered in so <strong>be sure to buy the computer with enough ram</strong> because if you don’t you might be stuck with an obsolete computer faster than you would like.</p>

<p>There’s  <strong><a href="http://amzn.to/1Uu2fZP">Amazon</a></strong> . Seriously.  When I started ramseeker, buying stuff online was from small specialty shops that sold memory upgrades.  Many of these stores are either no longer or have branched out to other products to sell - not only on their sites, but also on the Amazon marketplace.</p>

<p>Honestly, it’s just too easy to fire up your phone and you can buy almost anything and it’s at your door the next day in some cases - why bother signing up for shopping carts when a click of the button on your phone</p>

<p>Of course, mobile killed ramseeker and tracking ram prices too. My current phone has <strong>3GB of RAM</strong> .  This was just unthinkable not that long ago.</p>

<p>Operating systems  have gotten better at memory management too, so you really don’t need all the ram to run programs like you used to.</p>

<p>All of the above means that demand for memory upgrades have dwindled and prices have dropped where it’s just not worth it any more to compare ram prices as over half the vendors are out of business (or pivoting to another).</p>

<h2 id="so-what-now">So, What Now?</h2>

<p>To be honest, I am not sure. I’m keeping the site up for  a <a href="http://www.ramseeker.com/models">quick guide to ram upgrades</a> for the legacy macs but considering with few exceptions that there hasn’t been a new Apple computer release that will take a RAM upgrade in some time, I will no longer be updating it.</p>

<p>I’ve started to link to some sites and items that interest me. I figure if I’m interested then perhaps somebody else will be too. Also, this takes very little time.</p>

<p>I may start writing more about storage and SSD’s as they are really the new ram upgrade, and in most computers these are still upgrade-able by the end user. There is also the PC side of RAM upgrades, and like I have <a href="http://ramseeker.com/models">done with the Macs</a> , I might start working on a similar page for the PC too. This would be a much bigger project but it would be a good resource to have. Now that there’s software like <a href="http://www.neverware.com">cloudready</a> by neverware that will turn any old PC into a chromebook-like device adding some RAM and a cheap SSD to an older PC is a worthy upgrade.</p>

<p>Lastly, I just want to start writing and let time dictate what the future ramseeker.com looks like. Heck, this might end up being a personal blog.  Bloggers like <a href="http://www.john.do">John Saddington</a> and <a href="http://shawnblanc.net">Shawn Blanc</a> have evolved their sites over   time as they grow. There’s no rule that a site must stay the same.</p>

<p>I do want to thank every reader and sponsor of ramseeker.com over the years. Thanks to you a hobby site turned into a complete career  for over a decade.  I’ve now taken on a a part time job once again as the income from this site has eroded to next to nothing over time. (thank goodness for <a href="http://pages.github.com">free web hosting</a> ) but it’s been a very fun experience and I am glad to have been able to help you get a deal on memory upgrades over the years.</p>
