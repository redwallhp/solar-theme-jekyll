<p>These tools are not snap-on or craftsman quality but considering you get all this for about eight bucks, it’s kind of hard to complain</p>

<br>

		<div class="post-content"><p>The MacBook Pro 13” 2.9GHz dual-core Intel Core i7 can accept up to 16gb of RAM and both spinning hard drives as well much faster SSD drives for increased performance.</p>

<p><strong>RAM for MacBook Pro 13” 2.9GHz dual-core Intel Core i7</strong></p>

<p>This model of MacBook Pro can accept up to 16gb of RAM thanks to the 2 memory slots availabe. 16gb of RAM for this MacBook pro model is super cheap at about $50.00 for a 16gb kit. (<a href="http://amzn.to/1ONw3dI"><strong>check price</strong></a>)</p>

<p>If don’t want to upgrade the MacBook pro to 16gb, there’s always an 8gb option that will only cost you about thirty dollars (<a href="http://amzn.to/1ONw3dI"><strong>check price</strong></a>) but I suggest that if you’re going to to to the bother of upgrading the RAM on this MacBook Pro model that you do it right and just get all the ram installed that is allowed.</p>

<p><strong>*Spinning (traditional) hard drives for MacBook Pro 13” 2.9GHz dual-core Intel Core i7</strong></p>

<p>I don’t really recommend upgrading to a traditional hard drive on your MacBook Pro unless you really need to carry a lot of files with you at all times and need the storage space.</p>

<p>The benefits of traditional hard drives vs SSD drives is that the cost per gb is a lot lower when you compard prices of SSD vs HDD in the same capacity.</p>

<p>If you do prefer to buy a traditional hard drive for the MacBook Pro here’s a few suggestions:</p>

<p><a href="http://amzn.to/1UfojFL">Samsung Seagate 2TB Laptop HDD SATA III 2.5-Inch Internal Bare Drive</a></p>

<p><a href="http://amzn.to/1TLudiY">Seagate Laptop Thin 500 GB 7200RPM SATA 6 GB/s 32 MB Cache 2.5 Inch Hard Disk Drive</a></p>

<p><a href="http://amzn.to/1OP9IML">Samsung Momentus 4TB SATA III 5400 RPM 2.5-inch Hard Drive</a></p>

<h2 id="ssd-drives-for-macbook-pro-13-29ghz-dual-core-intel-core-i7">SSD Drives for MacBook Pro 13” 2.9GHz dual-core Intel Core i7</h2>

<p>SSD drives a much better choice for upgrading the hard drive on any computer. The main advantage is speed as there are no moving parts to slow down the read and write process so apps open quikly and your entire computer will feel more responsive.</p>

<p>The disadvantage of SSDs vs hard drives is cost. SSD drives are more expensive per gigabyte than traditional drives but prices continue to drop so more and more can afford a SSD upgrade for Macbook pro.</p>

<p>A few suggstions for SSD Drives for MacBook Pro:</p>

<p><a href="http://amzn.to/1WPCi8G">Samsung 850 EVO 250GB 2.5-Inch SATA III Internal SSD</a></p>

		<div class="post-content"><p>The MacBook Pro 13” 2.5GHz dual-core Intel Core i5  is one of the  last 
models to actually accept a memory upgrade as later models after 2013 only allowed you to configure memory upgrades  at the time of purchase,</p>

<h3 id="memory-upgrade-options">Memory Upgrade Options</h3>

<p>This model of MacBook Pro has 2 memory slots and can be upgraded to either 8GB or 16GB:</p>

<p><a href="http://amzn.to/1Ow9PCe">8GB MacBook Pro Memory</a></p>

<p><a href="http://amzn.to/1Ow9P4Z">16GB MacBook Pro Memory</a></p>

<p>At time of writing you can <a href="http://amzn.to/1Ow9P4Z">buy 16GB of RAM</a>  for this Apple MacBook Pro model for about  $50.00</p>

<h3 id="ssd-upgrade-options">SSD Upgrade Options</h3>

<p>SSD Drives have <a href="http://amzn.to/1XuumsQ">really dropped in price</a> with 250GB SSD prices under $100.00</p>

<p>with a few larger sizes available as well:</p>

<p><a href="http://amzn.to/1TgJfcR">500GB ssd drives</a> for about $150.00</p>

<p><a href="http://amzn.to/1TgJfcR">1TB  ssd drives</a> for about  $325.00</p>

<p><a href="http://amzn.to/1TjD9uu">2TB  ssd drives</a> for about $850.00</p>

<h3 id="traditional-hard-drive-upgrade-options">Traditional Hard Drive Upgrade Options</h3>

<p>If the prices on the SSD drives  are still too much money you can always upgrade  with  a traditional 2.5 inch spinning hard drive with <a href="http://amzn.to/1VYyCBg">1TB hard drive prices</a> costing about $50.00 and then go up from there.</p>

<p>Your best bet is to follow the instructions on how to upgrade this model <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/index?page=search&amp;type=organic&amp;src=support_searchbox_main&amp;locale=en_US&amp;q=MacBook%20Pro%2013%22%202.5GHz%20dual-core%20Intel%20Core%20i5#query=MacBook%20Pro%2013%22%202.5GHz%20dual-core%20Intel%20Core%20i5%20ram%20upgrade&amp;product=&amp;doctype=&amp;currentPage=1&amp;includeArchived=false">directly from Apple’s support page</a></p>

<p>RAM and an SSD upgrade can be had for $150.00 for a 240GB SSD and 16GB of RAM and these two upgrades can breathe new life into an older Mac.</p>

<p>I have tried some other popular to-do list programs like wunderlist, todoist and todo.txt, but I really like the outline format for getting stuff out of my head and into a workable to-do list. It works on every computer or device I have so I always have access to my to-do list regardless of mobile or desktop device.</p>
